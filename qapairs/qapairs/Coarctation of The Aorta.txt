i'm on benicar (olmesartan) 20 mg for hbp. my last blood test for potassium. it was 4. 6. what are the chances the benicar (olmesartan) increases it to dangerous levels?
if you are 18 years old on bp medication there may be else going on. you are too young for essential hypertension and need to be referred to a nephrologist to see if you have secondary hypertension. you need to be evaluated for a coarctation of the aorta conn's syndrome renal artery stenosis and a pheochromocytoma. you potassium of 4. 6 is not a problem your hypertension at 18 is.
i have had vsd repair and coarctation of aorta am i more susceptible for heart attack. warning signs? how to tell if its a heart attack or anxiety?
correction of coarctation of the aorta can still leave patients at risk for hypertension and/or arrhythmia. vsd repair patients can also be at risk for arrhythmias later. slow heart rates that might require pacemakers as well as fast heart rates (ventricular or supra ventricular) might develop.
would coarctation of the aorta in a teenager be identified when having an ecg is done?
the ekg might be abnormal as a result of the high blood pressure but there would be nothing specific to point to coarctation of the aorta on ekg. the blood pressure would be lower in the legs than in the arms and the pulse in the legs weaker than in the arms.
would coarctation of the aorta in a teenager be identified when having an ecg is done?
an ecg may pick up on coarctation. but it also may not. blood pressure measurements are on the best ways to screen for coarctation. please discuss any specific issues with your doctor if you are concerned.
would coarctation of the aorta in a teenager be identified when having an ecg is done?
ct or mr angiography is usual imaging test to detect such.
would coarctation of the aorta in a teenager be identified when having an ecg is done?
if a coarctation is mild or there are many "collateral" vessels (vessels that bypass the narrowing) then the ecg that could show stress or strain on the left ventricle may be normal. an ecg on someone with a coarctation of the aorta may be completely normal.

what's ideal blood pressure(0 risk of getting cerebral aneurysm even small one 1 to 2 mm) for prevention of cerebral aneurysm in 59 year old male?
there is no special bp goal even for those with known aneurysms and there is certainly no evidence to suggest that controlling bp without an aneurysm prevents them. meet the national goal of 140/90 or less and you are covered. major risk factors for cerebral aneurysm are heredity tobacco use and coarctation of the aorta.
what is the treatment for coarctation of the aorta?
if aortic coarctation is severe enough to cause hypertension and/or heart failure then treatments may include surgery or balloon angioplasty with or without aortic stenting. the choice of procedure depends on patient age aortic arch anatomy and co-existing cardiac and non-cardiac conditions.

what is the life expectancy of someone who has had coarctation of the aorta but not diagnosed?
complex answer. assume you mean untreated. this condition produces symptoms usually in early infancy and after 20-30 yrs old. on average untreated patients die in their mid 30's but there are patients who live much longer. in adults survival depends on the presence of other congenital or acquired cardiac conditions. when found this condition should be treated by an experienced cardiac surgeon.
what is the life expectancy of someone who has had coarctation of the aorta but not diagnosed?
mild cases can be completely asymptomatic and allow you a full productive life. the problem is in those moderate to severe cases where hypertension might be present and / or blood flow to the lower body can be compromised particularly if you are being treated for high blood pressure without knowing that you have a coarctation (the kidneys could be significantly affected). see your doctor! .
what kind of treatment can somebody get for coarctation of the aorta?
coarctation of the aorta is a narrowing of the main artery from the heart to the lower half of the body that can result in elevated blood pressure (hypertension). if it is severe enough to require treatment there are two options that may be available: surgical repair or non-surgical repair using a balloon catheter through a blood vessel. catheter repair is most often used in young people.
what kind of treatment can somebody get for coarctation of the aorta?
if there are symptoms such as arterial hypertension surgery is done. the narrowed part of the aorta can be removed and the ends reconnected if a lot has to be removed a graft can be put into place. the aorta can also be dilated with a balloon. treatment is conservative for patients who show no symptoms.

in kids aged 12 to 18 these are the most common reasons for high blood pressure: -essential hypertension - this is typically associated with family history overweight/obesity and/or unhealthy life-style such as little exercise and poor diet. -iatrogenic illness- high blood pressure caused by a medication such as birth control pills or adhd medications -renal parenchymal disease - kidney disease -renal vascular disease - narrowing of the blood vessels leading to the kidneys -endocrine causes - such as hyperthyroidism -coarctation of the aorta - a narrow area of the main artery leading from the heart as your can see renal (kidney) causes of high blood pressure are more common in children and teens than cardiac (heart) problems so if a child needs an evaluation for high blood pressure by a specialist we usually have them see a nephrologist. talk to your sons' doctor. they may have already performed testing to rule out many of the other causes above.
what types of patients get coarctation of the aorta?
this is congenital. it can cause hypertension as a presenting sign.
what types of patients get coarctation of the aorta?
you are born with it. it is three times more common in males. it results in hypertension so it frequently is identified in younger patients.
what types of patients get coarctation of the aorta?
there are no specific patients that develop it. there is a slight gender difference but no specific group that seems to be significantly associated with developing coarctation. it occurs in premature babies all the way to adults as well as among all races.
what are the causes coarctation of the aorta?
coarctation usually occurs near the site of the pda. the pda is a normal channel in the fetal circulation which helps blood bypass the lungs (since fetuses don't breathe). when the baby is born the pda constricts and closes. in some patients the aorta also become constricted and leads to coarctation.
what are the causes coarctation of the aorta?
it is congenital defect.

when can someone have a surgical correction for a coarctation of the aorta?
when they have symptoms or it is causing issues with the blood pressure.
what causes high diastolic pressure in people?
most systolic or diastolic hypertension is 'essential" (no reason you just have it). it does run in families. there are certain unusual causes such as adrenal tumors and blockage in the arteries that supply the kidney which cause "secondary hypertension". (there is a cause. ) coarctation of the aorta is another example of "correctible hypertension. ".
which drugs are used to manage coarctation of the aorta?
blood pressure medications are generally the primary medicines for coarctation diagnosed in adults. the ultimate treatment nearly always requires either surgery or a catheterization. please discuss this with your cardiologist.
which drugs are used to manage coarctation of the aorta?
the fundamental problem is mechanical with a blockage to blood flow in the aorta. therefore the true cure is surgical correction but this is reserved for those with severe obstruction or associated complications. the most common consequence is high blood pressure (i. e. proximal to the obstruction) which is sometimes very hard to control and this is where medications come into play.
which drugs are used to manage coarctation of the aorta?
antihypertensive medications should be used in treatment for coarctation patients. it however is only supportive therapy and a mechanical intervention (stent vs surgey) will be required. bacterial endocarditis prohylaxis should also be used in this patient poulation for such procedures as dental work etc.

coarctation symptoms depend on the severity. many people have no symptoms. but symptoms may include leg/abdominal pain abdominal cramps headache (from hypertension) and possibly chest pain if severe. if concerned please discuss this with your cardiologist.
what are some of the symptoms of coarctation of the aorta?
with a coarct or "pinching" of the aorta you might have high blood pressure in the top of your body and low pressure in the lower part of your body. in most cases it is mild and incidentally found. coarct is also associated with other congenital abnormalities and a cardiologist should be consulted.
what are some of the symptoms of coarctation of the aorta?
there are no symptoms unless you have stroke. coarct causes high blood pressure and aneurysm that can rupture.
when is coarctation of the aorta diagnosed?
coarctation is usually detected routinely by noting a marked discrepancy in blood pressure between the arms and legs. this frequently is part of a work-up for severe hypertension--i. e. resistant to medications or occuring in an unusually young patient--which is a result of the obstruction to blood flow through the aorta (with build-up of pressure in the arms where bp is routinely measured).
when is coarctation of the aorta diagnosed?
the time of diagnosis depends on the severity. cases are diagnosed throughout life with some cases diagnosed in the first days of life while others are diagnosed in adults. again the timing depends on when symptoms develop which lead to the work-up and diagnosis of coarctation.
when is coarctation of the aorta diagnosed?
diagnosis of coarct can be made by physical exam. pt usually will have upper extremity hypertension with diminished lower extemity pulses. they usually a murmur. it can be continuous machine like murmur that radiates to the back or a murmur of bicuspid aortic valve disease whis is associated. pts tend to die in their mid 30s if not treated. usually from berry aneurysm in brain heart failure mi etc.
when is coarctation of the aorta a problem?
it depends on whether it is severe enough to cause symptoms or other health problems like hypertension. a very very mild coarctation may not cause any problems (though this is rare). so it become a problem when it becomes a problem. for some this occurs in infancy while others make only develop problems as an adult.
when is coarctation of the aorta a problem?
generally coarctation is a problem if it causes a severe obstruction to blood flow through the aorta with build-up of high pressures on the near-side and fall-off on the distal side. this can result in severe hypertension in the arms (and proximal regions) and poor perfusion to organs beyond the coarctation. there is also a risk of aorta aneurysm or dissection which must be watched for.
when is coarctation of the aorta a problem?
it is a problem when you have it or when you have to deal with it. . if you have significant degree of coarctation it will cause a problem.
what test is used to diagnose coarctation of the aorta?
a simple but effective way is to measure blood pressure in both arms and at least one leg. we now most commonly first check with an echocardiogram. depending on the quality of those images a ct or mri may help. but again good old fashioned blood pressure is the best way to start.
what test is used to diagnose coarctation of the aorta?
a specialized ct scan of the chest called a ct angiogram or a specialized mri scan called in mr angiogram can be used to diagnose this condition.
what test is used to diagnose coarctation of the aorta?
in coarctation there is a normal easily palpable pulse in the right arm/wrist and none or greatly diminished pulse and bp in the left arm wrist and both legs. it's pretty easy to diagnose right at the "bedside". a ct with contrast or mra can confirm it. a plain chest xray will classically show rib notching.
what are the consequences of coarctation of the aorta?
some of the complications that may occur are high blood pressure rupture of the aorta stroke premature heart disease and weakening or bulging of arteries in the brain. if aortic coarctation is left untreated it could unfortunately lead to heart disease heart failure and death.
what are the consequences of coarctation of the aorta?
there are many. in younger patients it can lead to profound lack of blood flow to the body organ injury and even death. in adults it most commonly causes hypertension but also limits blood flow to organs and can also cause organ damage. patients with coarctation are also at greater risk of coronary artery disease for incompletely understood reasons.
what are the consequences of coarctation of the aorta?
untreated it leads to congestive heart failure stroke and death. (luckily nowadays it can be treated).
why would you treat children with coarctation of the aorta?
the how is already answered by dr. rubin. if your question is why treat coarctation it is to improve blood flow to the organs of the lower part of the body prevent severe high blood pressure in upper part of body causing headache dizziness nosebleeds shortness of breath and to prevent eventual development of enlarged heart and heart failure.
why would you treat children with coarctation of the aorta?
mostly we may treat coarctation because it often puts a severe strain on the heart muscle which can lead to permanent heart damage and even death. the cure is generally surgery.
why would you treat children with coarctation of the aorta?
suegical repair or aortic stent.
why would you treat children with coarctation of the aorta?
if a child is diagnosed with coarctation then the circulation of blood is almost certainly negatively effected. infants that present with coarctation require life-saving treatment to get blood to their body. older children require surgery to re-establish normal blood flow. without treatment they will develop hypertension as well as have extra work loading on the heart. these are not good.
what is the usual prognosis for a severe coarctation of the aorta?
the specific prognosis depends on age of diagnosis other medical conditions any problems prior to diagnosis and the location of the lesion which affects the means of treatment (i. e. surgery or cath). the prognosis can be excellent even with "severe" cases but depends on the factor above. please discuss this with your cardiologist.
what is the usual prognosis for a severe coarctation of the aorta?
untreated coarctation can lead to debilitating claudication heart failure renal failure and death. however coarctation should be a completely curable condition with excellent long term outcomes.
what is the usual prognosis for a severe coarctation of the aorta?
it must be repaired --.
what does it mean for an adult to have coarctation of the aorta?
coarctation of the aorta is a congenital abnormality where portion of the aorta (large artery carrying blood out from the heart to rest of the body) is narrowed. it may be narrowed only slightly so that no obstruction is noted in childhood but adults may still develop: high blood pressure early-onset coronary disease or aorticaneurysm or dissection. close surveillance is important.
what does it mean for an adult to have coarctation of the aorta?
a coarctation in an adult means the arms and head have been getting higher blood pressure than the abdomen kidneys and legs. unfortunately it may mean that there have been changes in both the arteries in the head and in the kidneys. this may result in elevated blood pressures for life and may require mess to keep the bp normal.
what does it mean for an adult to have coarctation of the aorta?
coarctation is a serious condition. it is also relatively common with well-established corrective procedures that are safe and largely successful. coarctation can be treated with surgery or catheterization; adult diagnosed are more likely to be treatable in the cath lab vs. children. some patients (~10-20%) develop recurrence and require another catheterization.
what causes the coarctation of the aorta?
it is a cogenital defect and is present in utero ( before birth).
what causes the coarctation of the aorta?
coarctation usually occurs near the site of the pda. the pda is a normtal channel in the fetal circulation which helps blood bypass the lungs (since fetuses don't breathe). when the baby is born the pda constricts and closes. in some patients the aorta also become constricted and leads to coarctation.

coarctation is a form of congenital heart disease. one is born with the defect. it can be surgically corrected.
what complications can accompany the coarctation of the aorta?
aortic coarctation is associated with hypertension (high blood pressure). this can develop even years later after successful surgical correction due to a diffuse dysfunction of cells lining artery walls. this can also affect coronary arteries (causing atherosclerosis) and the adjacent (non-coarcted) aorta with risk of aneurysm formation or dissection of the aorta wall.
what complications can accompany the coarctation of the aorta?
coarctation of the aota can occur by itself or with other congenital problems of the heart or blood vessels. the most common would be abnormality of the aortic valve called bicuspid aortic valve.

females with coaractation have a good prognosis. patients who are not treated for coarctation of the aorta may reach the age of 35 years; fewer than 20% survive to age 50 years. if coarctation is repaired before the age of 14 years the 20-year survival rate is 91%. if coarctation is repaired after the age of 14 years the 20-year survival rate is 79%.
what is the prognosis for females with coarctation of the aorta?
if corrected in a timely fashion.
what is the prognosis for females with coarctation of the aorta?
prognosis does not depend on sex very much. it depends more on age of diagnosis and whether there are other significant medical conditions. in general coarctation is easily treated with surgery or catheterization. and there tends to be 10-20% recurrence risk; most recurrences can be treated in the cath lab.
what is coarctation of the aorta and how is it treated?
it is narrowing of the aorta (largest artery in the body). it is classified by severity (size of narrowing and pressure difference across it) as well as location (relative to the head-and-neck vessels). it generally requires either a surgical or catheterization procedure to relieve the narrowed segment and allow normal blood flow.
what is coarctation of the aorta and how is it treated?
it is a focal narrowing of the aorta. . it is diagnosed by a difference in blood pressures in the upper and lower extremities. aorta angiography can locate the narrowing and it can be treated by ballon angioplasty and by stent placement in most cases.
what is coarctation of the aorta and how is it treated?
coarctation is a narrowing of the aorta immediately after the left subclavian artery. the narrowing is present at birth and interferes with blood flow to the lower half of the body. pulses are greater in the arms compared to the legs in the patients are typically hypertensive. in some patients the abnormality can be repaired with stenting. in other patients surgery is required.

it is a narrowing of the aorta the major blood vessel that branches off your heart and delivers blood to your body. it is usually congenital and may range from mild to severe. surgery may be required as a newborn if critical. it may not be detected until older depending on severity. it often occurs along with other heart defects. it requires surgery or catheter balloon and/or stenting.
what are the most common symptoms of coarctation of the aorta?
coarctation is a constriction somewhere along the path of the aorta. the symptoms largely depend on where the constriction is. you can have high pressure above and normal to low pressure below. these both cause symptoms like headache (from the high blood pressure) and exercise intolerance and pain in the legs along with cold feet (from the low pressure).
what are the most common symptoms of coarctation of the aorta?
the exact location and severity of the obstruction and age of presentation will dictate the symptoms. disparity in blood pressures between extremeties may be noted but associated conditions like intracardiac shunts may present with cyanosis. shortness of breath and heart failure may be presenting symptoms but infants can't relay those symptoms. physical exam and echocardiography are key.
what are the consequences of coarctation of the aorta in a child?
as with most things it depends on the severity and age. coarctation is a degree of narrowing or obstruction in the arch of the aorta. as a result the part of the aorta before the obstruction usually has higher pressure than after the obstruction. so the heart and the arteries going to the head and the r arm usually have high pressure and may cause sometimes severe and irreversible complications.

coarctation of the aorta is common in patients with some chromosomal abnormalities such as turner's syndrome.
what is coarctation of the aorta and how do you treated?
by definition coarctation of the aorta is a abnormality of vascular embryology. at birth flow is adequate for the limited activity i the new born and early toddler years but as children age their growing bodies and activity out grows the narrowed aorta's ability to supply enough blood fast enough to keep up. once identified the narrowing is corrected surgically with a bypass procedure.
which is more dangerous a hole in the heart or coarctation of the aorta?
since there are variations in the size of any hole or the amount of tightness in any coarctation the question cannot have a simple answer. some holes close without treatment some produce heart failure without treatment. some coarctations need urgent surgery while others can go years without treatment.
which is more dangerous a hole in the heart or coarctation of the aorta?
depends on the size of the hole and degree of coarch narrowing. in general i'd say coarctation of the aorta is more limiting to people's lifestyle but patent vsd or asd can lead to stroke if clots pass through the heart to the brain.
what is the life expectancy of someone who had coarctation of the aorta but wasn't treated?
the severity of the narrowing. many people are never diagnosed and simply live sedentary lives due to their nearly constant fatigue.
what causes hypertension in teens 16-19?
if htn is mild it is likely primary htn but in anyone that age with marked elevation ( stage 2) i would consider secondary causes of htn to include renovascular causes coarctation of the aorta catecholamine or glucocorticoid excess. careful review of meds and otc / illicits and ocp.
why doesn't coarctation of aorta affect the 1st and 2nd intercostal arteries?
coarctation of the aorta is a narrowing of the aorta so if the narrowing is below the 1st or 2nd intercostal artery then likely those arteries would not be affected. also there is a good collateral circulation along the spinal cord which helps to protect the circulation.
what does it mean if your blood pressures are different in your two arms?
bp readings are generally a bit higher on one side vs the other. if there is a significant difference however it may indicate a serious problem such as coarctation of the aorta. talk to your doctor to determine if your difference needs work up.
