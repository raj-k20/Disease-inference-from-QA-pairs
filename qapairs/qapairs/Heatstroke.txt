i often get severely dehydrated and feel dizzy/faint but i haven't died or fainted or been hospital how do i survive so well? i even exercise in heat
you have survived on luck or perhaps a contributing factor of genetics. but hey! take care of yourself and don't push it to the limits like this! heatstroke is a real phenomena which can take your life! listen to your body! drink lots of water and remember this. dizziness and faintness while exercising in the heat is a first sign of heat exhaustion so sit down cool down drink water!
what must i do if my elderly parent has heat stroke symptoms?
heatstroke in the elderly is a serious medical issue. if you have concerns about this it is important to seek out an emergency evaluation.
