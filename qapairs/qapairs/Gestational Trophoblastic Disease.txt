missed miscarriage at week 8 baby lost heart beat. induced miscarriage with cytote 3 weeks ago now hcg level 300( was 337 two days ago) need d&c?
cytotec (misoprostol) will usually cause you to pass the tissue left in your uterus. if it doesn't a d&c is frequently performed. its also a good idea to continue repeating the hcg level after the d&c until it is zero. this will ensure that there is no other problems related to the miscarriage such as gestational trophoblastic disease. best wishes!
