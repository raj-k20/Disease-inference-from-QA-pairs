are chronic leukemia and breast cancer related?
a very interesting question. there may be a higher incidence of breast cancer in women with chronic lymphocytic leukemia but there is no association with chronic myelocytic leukemia. mouse mammary tumor virus can cause both breast cancer and lymphocytic leukemia in mice. whether this has anything to do with humans is under investigation.
