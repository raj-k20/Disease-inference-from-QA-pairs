postural hypotension or benign paroxysmal positional vertigo. sound like you need to see an internist to check heart and lungs. how many steps before winded an chest pain? what is daily exercise routine?
small ischemic stroke 2006 to left cordite. dizziness really bad now. turning over when in bed or bending down. is it related to the stroke? thanks
sounds like your symptoms are positional and may relate to condition called benign paroxysmal positional vertigo that can be further evaluated by a neurologist or ent doctor. however given the history of stroke seeing a doctor anytime you have new neurological symptom as soon as possible is extremely important!
when i bend down i get dizzy?
sounds like benign paroxysmal positional vertigo or bppv. it's a spinning sensation occurring with head movements such as looking up turning over in bed or bending down. it's due to the dislodgement of calcium particles from within the semicircular canals of the inner ear. it's not a serious condition and self-resolving in several weeks but can recur. there are maneuvers and meds that can help.
when i lay down or lie on my sides i feel dizzy why is that?
if by dizzy you mean that you feel as if you are moving or things around you are moving then that is called vertigo. vertigo is a problem usually of the inner ear. if vertigo occurs only when you move your head in a certain position and then goes away shortly thereafter it is called benign paroxysmal positional vertigo or "bppv ". this is best treated by an "epley" maneuver.
