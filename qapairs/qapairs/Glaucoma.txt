the short answer is no. iridology is not supported by valid research studies and is widely considered quackery. clincal data does not support correlations between illnesses and changes in the iris. in controlled experiments iridologists have performed no better than chance in determining disease or the presence of a condition. the iris does not undergo substantial changes during an individual's life. iris texture develops during gestation and remains unchanged after birth. there are variations in color during infancy and changes caused by glaucoma treatment. the unchanging nature of iris structures allows biometric technology which uses iris recognition for definite identification of individuals. your daughter should see her doctor for clarification of the evaluation done in the emergency room and a perhaps a more focused investigation of her symptoms.

weight gain can occur as a side effect of some beta blockers especially the older ones such as atenolol (tenormin) and metoprolol (lopressor toprol-xl). the average weight gain is no more than 4 pounds (about 2 kilograms). newer beta blockers such as carvedilol (coreg) don't usually cause weight gain as a side effect. weight may rise in the first weeks of taking the beta blocker and then generally stabilizes. however the beta blockers that can cause weight gain usually aren't prescribed unless other medications haven't worked or if you have a specific heart condition that requires taking those medications. beta blockers are used to treat a host of conditions including high blood pressure heart failure migraines glaucoma and anxiety. doctors aren't sure exactly why some beta blockers cause weight gain. it could be that beta blockers slow your metabolism. also if you switch from taking a water pill (diuretic) to a beta blocker as a treatment for high blood pressure you may gain a few pounds of weight that the diuretic kept off. if you're taking a beta blocker for heart failure tell your doctor immediately if you begin to gain more than 3 to 4 pounds (about 1. 5 to 2 kilograms) particularly if the weight gain continues beyond your first week of taking the drug. this could mean that fluid is building up in your legs abdomen or chest which may signal that your heart failure is worsening.
