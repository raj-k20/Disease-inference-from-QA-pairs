in mva 10dys ago. had bulging discs in neck. severe neck and low back pain. lortabs don't help. er won't help. what should i be taking 4 pain?
narcotics do not work very well for this type of pain and have a very high addiction rate. stick with motrin and tylenol (acetaminophen) together but an alternative therapies like stretching massage and heat. the more you move around the better you will get.
i am 32 weeks pregnant and am having horrible sciataca and back pain from a car accident a few years ago. i took a 30mg oxycontin that i still had from an old prescription. i'm wondering if this will effect my baby or any drug test that may be administere
pregnancy causes many changes in the body and can both be a source of new back pain and aggravate existing back pain. opiate pain medication will pass directly into your baby's blood and regular use in pregnancy can actually cause addiction and a withdrawal syndrome in the child so opiates are not a preferred pain med in pregnancy. your obstetrician or primary doc has other ways to help.
my husband had severe lower left back pain sweating and freezing followed and complained of his tits hurting. he has had cellulitis n past?
what you are describing seems to involve a lot of different things. there is no rule that says you can only have one disease at a time. low back and "tits" pain are unusual to be related. the past cellulitis is also probably unrelated unless he has it currently. a viral syndrome can cause a lot of things to have symptoms. is there fevers nausea muscle or joint aches? a doctor will untangle this.
my husband had severe lower left back pain sweating and freezing followed and complained of his tits hurting. he has had cellulitis n past?
the severe pain with sweating and freezing (fever chills and sweating) is suggestive of kidney infection. possibility of infectin with a stone is to be considered. he needs urinalysis urine culture blood culture and kidney ultrasounds. needs urgent medical care.

you need to have supervision from a rehab doc and you will benefit from a combination of physical therapy massage and acupuncture. too soon to say if you have injured shoulder joint brachial plexus or sacroiliac joint but all could occur from a mva. find experienced specialty care this is not an area for a generalist.

can lower back pain be caused by tetanus shot or could it be tetanus itself?
just having lower back pain and no other symptoms is uncommon for the tetanus shot and the combined tetanus/whooping cough booster. if it is from the shot it'll go away on its own.
can lower back pain be caused by tetanus shot or could it be tetanus itself?
tetanus shot given as dt or tdap will not cause pain in lower back and just low back pain is unlikely symptom of tetanus which is serious disease and takes 2 weeks to 2 months after a contaminated wound in people who have not been immunized against tetanus take some pain med or consult your doctir for low back pain if it persists
can a mva make bulging discs in the neck herniate? how to know? neck&back pain after 10dy intolerable. new low back & rt shoulder pain. meds no help!

i have had terrible lower back pain for the past two weeks also terrible headaches and ringing in my ear also have been really worn out and have sweet smelling urine
those are very concerning symptoms and you need to be seen immediately by a doctor. severe lower back pain headaches tinnitus (ringing in the ears) fatigue and sweet smelling urine are concerning findings. you will need a complete examination and studies to determine a diagnosis. please call your doctor and arrange to be seen immediately and if you can't then you will need to go to the er.

the sudden weight gain swelling and low back pain seem to point to a kidney issue. it is possible that your kidney function has decreased which is causing your body to not filter fluid effectively and instead retain large amounts fluids (leading to swelling in the body). however the swelling can also be attributed to congestive heart failure where your heart is not functioning properly so blood and fluid gets backed up into the body system. seeing a doctor is crucial. if the pain becomes too severe to tolerate it is prudent to go to the emergency department.
i have very severe back pain and i went to see a pa and she said it was a lipoma tumor. the lump on my lower back is mushy hard and causes a lot of pain up my back and it is hard to use the restroom now. i went back to see the pa andshe said it wasnt a li

lipomas in general do not cause pain unless compressed. you need to see a physician.

typically lipomas don't cause severe pain and they certainly should not keep you from have bowel movements or being able to urinate. you should see an internist who can refer you to a proper physician.

regardless of what she thinks it is a mass that is causing pain needs to be evaluated further either by imaging studies like an ultrasound or be biopsied or possibly removed. a general surgeon will be able to examine you and advise you on the next best course of action. for now you can try an nsaid like ibuprofen or advil (ibuprofen) for the pain. if this does not help your primary care provider may prescribe another medication until you are able to see a surgeon. best of luck to you.

if i lose weight will it relieve pressure of my disc in my back and will the pain stop from sciatic nerve although a piece of da disc is on my nerve?
weight loss is an effective way to lessen the mechanical stresses on the spine and quite often leads to improved back pain and improved leg pain from a disc herniation.
if i lose weight will i also lose my breasts?
and depending on your personal situation that might be a blessing especially if you have some back pain from the weight of heavy breasts. if you lose too much --which you can't help; so be it-breasts are mostly composed of fat. when you lose weight you lose all over. therefore you will lose fat in your breasts too.

i am 70lbs overweight and have a major back pain due to lifting my child. what exercise can i do?
the first thing apply moist heat on the neck for about 15-20 minutes. this can be followed by very gently massaging the back of the neck by skin moistures once you feel you can move your neck somewhat easily and without pain you can try some slow neck and shoulder stretches and head tilts if these doesn't ease the stiffness even by a fraction it is better to pay a visit to an orthopedist.
i am 70lbs overweight and have a major back pain due to lifting my child. what exercise can i do?
you would need access to a pool but water exercise is an excellent way to burn calories and get in shape. you could swim walk-run in chest deep water join a water aerobics class. regular aerobic exercise not only helps with weight loss but also reduces back pain for many folks. if you have no pool access a recumbent exercise bicycle may be a good alternative.

i hav a hiatal hernia & never hav heartburn but i always hav mild to severe upper central chest/ back pain that come & go often. can it be my hernia?
be sure you rule out cardiac etiology first. do not assume your chest pain is from the hernia.
i hav a hiatal hernia & never hav heartburn but i always hav mild to severe upper central chest/ back pain that come & go often. can it be my hernia?
yes. hiatal hernias (slipping of the upper portion of the stomach where the esophagus comes in to a position above the diaphragm) can cause either fairly severe acid symptoms treatable with zantac (ranitidine) or prilosec or pressure from the mass effect of the organ in the wrong position or from intermittent obstruciton of food. you don't always have both types of symptoms.
im very obese. i know this because i have severe low back pain when i walk. i can't even walk for 5 minutes without pain. what is the best way for me to lose weight. i cannot have weight loss surgery because i've had stomach surgery before. please help?
i recommend finding a weight loss center that consist of a team of professionals who evaluate you individually and not provide a "shot gun" approach. a physician should look at your drug list and make sure u are not on meds that is causing weight gain or preventing weight loss. a exercise person should eval you and design a program around your limitations dieticians to work with you individually.
im very obese. i know this because i have severe low back pain when i walk. i can't even walk for 5 minutes without pain. what is the best way for me to lose weight. i cannot have weight loss surgery because i've had stomach surgery before. please help?

not every obese patient needs to undergo weight loss surgery to achieve successful long lasting weight loss. but the odds are stacked against you in today's world. we should not be able to walk into a convenience store and get any item we want at any time. and our portion size has tripled over the past 50 years. i would recommend an evaluation by a personal trainer and a dietician and/or md.
i am on oxycodone 10/325 but recently diagnosed with hepatitis c. what would be a good long term treatment for my chronic back pain?
very few 22 year old men have severe chronic back pain. the approach which seems likely to provide the most benefit would be to be evaluated and learn why you have such severe pain and what can be done about the cause. chronic narcotic use may not be the best solution.
i am on oxycodone 10/325 but recently diagnosed with hepatitis c. what would be a good long term treatment for my chronic back pain?
the back pain can be caused by muscle strain spinal stenosis ruptured disc nerve impingement. . for young patients i recommend from heat pads exercise massage physical therapy. long term narcotic use is never shown to be at benefit. it also can affect on your liver function. you should see a pain specialist for evaluation.
i am on oxycodone 10/325 but recently diagnosed with hepatitis c. what would be a good long term treatment for my chronic back pain?
opioids are not helpful long term for back pain. good strength and conditioning is. there is minimal evidence that long term opioids in back pain helps to get u more active.
i am on oxycodone 10/325 but recently diagnosed with hepatitis c. what would be a good long term treatment for my chronic back pain?
i agree with dr. perez but if you have to be on an opiate you can be prescribed most without acetaminophen.
i am on oxycodone 10/325 but recently diagnosed with hepatitis c. what would be a good long term treatment for my chronic back pain?
consult a pain management group. some of the best strategies involve combination of biobehavioral approaches (relaxation etc) drug therapy (anti-epileptics and anti-depressants) and physical medicine. you can find helpful information on www. theacpa. org/.
i am on oxycodone 10/325 but recently diagnosed with hepatitis c. what would be a good long term treatment for my chronic back pain?
ur in luck. long term opioids are rarely helpful in back pain. there area many non opioid therapies available. there is no single solution. by the way ur 23 do u really want low testosterone at ur age from opioids. is it worth it?
i am on oxycodone 10/325 but recently diagnosed with hepatitis c. what would be a good long term treatment for my chronic back pain?
best to minimize intake of liver metabolized drugs eg acetaminophen. consider just plain oxycodone.
i am on oxycodone 10/325 but recently diagnosed with hepatitis c. what would be a good long term treatment for my chronic back pain?
an even better strategy - given the meds now available - would be to treat and quite probably cure the hepatitis c infection. . once it has been confirmed by the appropriate testing (i. e. an antibody test alone is insufficient). you need an hcv pcr and a genotype test to work out what to do next. then of course avoid the behavior that led to the infection. see a hepatologist (liver specialist).
i am on oxycodone 10/325 but recently diagnosed with hepatitis c. what would be a good long term treatment for my chronic back pain?
you can get oxycodone without acetaminophen.
i am on oxycodone 10/325 but recently diagnosed with hepatitis c. what would be a good long term treatment for my chronic back pain?
generally all opiates go through the liver. the least liver toxic medications are fentanyl and hydromorphone. at your age i would consider trying to avoid any opiates especially with the hep c diagnosis.
i am on oxycodone 10/325 but recently diagnosed with hepatitis c. what would be a good long term treatment for my chronic back pain?
avoiding tylenol (acetaminophen) is definitely most important but you should also consider trying other non- opioid medications to help with chronic pain. you will develop a tolerance to the oxycodone and it wont work as well. there are also other modalities to help with the pain like physical therapy and tens therapy.
i think i would like a boob reduction but don't know if i should try to diet first?

how did you figure it was l5 &6. there are typically 5 lumbar vertebra but some patients can have 6. your surgeon will have to examine you & work things up with imaging studies given symptoms on going for over a year. a few of possible diagnosis could include sacroiliitis versus other spinal issues vascular problem urologic/gyn etiologies etc. a work-up & exam will help point to a diagnosis.

your explanation cut off before any question was asked. but it does sound as if you may have a problem with a disc and the pain is radiation from nerve roots exiting the spine and being compressed and irritated.

i take pradaxa. will a steroid shot to relieve back pain interact? the pradaxa is for an irregular heart beat. the lower back pain was caused when i lifted something too heavy.
any blood thinner and what i assume is an epidural steroid injection you are referring to is a serious matter. pradaxa is a relatively new drug and not everybody knows about it like coumadin (warfarin) or heparin. the timing of stopping and restarting this medication with respect to a spinal injection is very important. bleeding into the spinal space could cause permanent injury if done wrong.

my heart is pounding so hard it is making my upper back hurt. is this normal? my chest feels heavy and it makes me slightly short of breath. this has been going on for nearly 2 months off and on. is it possibly just stress related?
it sounds like you may have a dysrhythmia (abnormal heartbeat) that is occurring intermittently. there are several types of dysrhythmia that can cause the symptoms you describe but paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia or psvt (see link below) is a fairly common dysrhythmia that can cause your heart rate to increase far beyond normal. whenever your heart beats faster it requires more oxygen to compensate for the increased workload. if your coronary arteries cannot supply enough blood to meet this demand chest or back pain (angina) can result. if this situation persists you could have a heart attack. stress caffeine alcohol and certain medications can increase the irritability of your heart and make a dysrhythmia worse but in most cases the "trigger" for the abnormal rhythm is already present somewhere in the tissues of your heart. other conditions such as anemia could contribute to your symptoms as well. in healthy young adults psvt is typically well-tolerated but any time a dysrhythmia causes angina chest pressure shortness of breath or fainting urgent medical evaluation is warranted. all things considered i think your body is sending you a message. whatever is going on here your heart doesn't seem to be tolerating it. call your doctor as soon as possible for an evaluation. good luck! <link>

mri accurately portrays injuries and structural abnormalities in your vertebrae disks spinal cord and nerve roots and it is a good way to detect injuries to the soft tissues surrounding your spinal column. in addition mri can usually detect inflammation or infection in any of these tissues. what mri cannot depict is the "gating" that often occurs in chronic pain syndromes. that is it does not show nervous impulses that arise as the result of painful conditions (and many of these impulses continue to travel through your nervous system even when injured or inflamed tissues have healed). if the mri does not show any serious abnormalities your daughter's symptoms could be due to changes in the way her nervous system relays messages and alterations in brain centers that are responsible for pain perception. if she hasn't already done so consultation with a pain management specialist could prove useful in this respect. i hope she finds relief soon.
