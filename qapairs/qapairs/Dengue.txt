a definition of bradycardia is a heart rate (hr) < 60 beats per minute. usually hr increases by approx 10bpm per degree of fever. high fever with normal hr is "relative bradycardia;" hr is lower than expected. relative bradycardia occurs in dengue for reasons felt to be related to the immune system but exact mechanism as yet is unknown to my knowledge.
