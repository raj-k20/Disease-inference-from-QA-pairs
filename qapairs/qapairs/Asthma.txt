why am i obsessed with having the drugs i used to be addicted to? like ecstasy liquor xanax (alprazolam) etc. am i still addicted even if i never do it?
addiction is a chronic diseases that can never really be cured in the medical sense. however like other chronic diseases (e. g. asthma diabetes) it can be kept under control by maintaining good health and avoiding "triggers". triggers for addictive behavior include things that weaken judgment such as boredom lack of sleep alcohol or hanging out with others who continue to abuse drugs.
i'm obese can it cause tightness in my chest while laying flat on back? had ekg done everything came back normal.
causes would be pressure on the diaphram and stomach. this can directly cause discomfort and limitations on breathing and indirectly cause reflux secondary asthma (from reflux) esophageal spasm perhaps sleep apnea or epiglottal problems and probably other things. not eating directly before bed. slight propping up (contacting me on weight loss) and perhaps other studies.
what are the most fatal health problems are linked to being overweight?
over 20 different medical conditions have been linked to obesity. the yearly cost to the healthcare system is estimated at over $100 billion. the common disorders include hypertension asthma reflux diabetes arthritis sleep apnea hyperlipidemia depression and an increase risk of falls. life threatening conditions include heart disease certain cancers and blood clots.
what to do if i have asthma but don't like to take it because people say it makes you chubby?
i think you are talking about the steroids used in asthma treatment. this steroids are like cortisone and long term oral or injected use can casue this problem. however the inhaled steroids have little or no effect on weight gain (most of it is not absorbed into your blood stream but stays in your lungs. if you r physician feels you need this type of therapy- please listen to him/her. good luck

i'm on 10mg lexapro (escitalopram) and taking garcinia cambogia. am i putting myself in danger?
that garcinia cambogia contains hca which can cause liver problems especially at quantities that most diet pills pack in. it can also potentially interfere with medications like statins asthma and allergy iron and most notably psychotropic medicines including the ssris which is what lexapro (escitalopram) is. i would have extreme caution taking garcinia with lexapro (escitalopram).
my daughters sugar levelswere 8. 1 and she went for a fasting glucose test the following day but i was told it will be following day results in but 2nd day still waiting is this normal or is something wrong. she is a bedwetter and overweight with asthma.?
a blood sugar of 8. 1 mmol/l is elevated for anyone. however if your child also has asthma checking a blood sugar while on oral steroids could acutely raise blood sugar. a hba1c would be much more accurate for assessing chronic blood sugar control. chronic bed wetting not sign of diabetes. if she is overweight consider obstructive sleep apnea which causes this & it makes asthma worse esp w/reflux.
my daughters sugar levelswere 8. 1 and she went for a fasting glucose test the following day but i was told it will be following day results in but 2nd day still waiting is this normal or is something wrong. she is a bedwetter and overweight with asthma.?
if the test you are referring to is your daughter's hemoglobin a1c level then your daughter is part of the growing epidemic of children with diabetes. her asthma may well be due to her obesity. first you need the results of more tests because one single test could have an erroneous result. either way if your daughter is overweight the sooner you and she get educated about food the better.
why can't we take tramadol when we have sleep apnea induced asthma and a seizure disorder? what can happen if we take the max of 4 tramadol?
1. unresolved infection at the occiput makes sleep apnea more significant. 2. frequently seizures are the result of stage 2 lyme disease. 3. every significant case of asthma tests positive for mold toxicity. in my clinical experience. specialized urine testing to diagnose mold toxins
why can't we take tramadol when we have sleep apnea induced asthma and a seizure disorder? what can happen if we take the max of 4 tramadol?
tramadol has severe side effects which can affect your breathing. the difficulty is compounded if you were to take 4 tablets. considering your conditions of sleep apnea asthma and seizures your breathing would be further depressed and might lead to an early demise

is tympanic membrane perforation a contraindication for cpap & apap use for sleep apnea what is the treatment for ear discharge from this condition?
cpap overview cpap (continuous positive airway pressure) is a tool which can be used to assist the oxygenation of several respiratory pathologies. cpap is not a r eplacement for any medicati on or procedure but a t ool which can provide a high level of ventilatory support without the need for rsi or intubation. patients whose condition is resistant to parenteral medications but whose respiratory effort does not yet require intubation should be considered prime candidates for cpap. indications? respiratory distress secondary to suspected congesti ve heart failure acute cardiogenic pulmonary edema pneumonia and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (asthma bronchitis emphysema). contraindications? unconsciousness? suspected pneumothorax? inadequate respiratory drive? shock/hypotension (bp <90)? chest wall trauma? persistent nausea/vomiting? has active upper gi bleeding or history of recent gastric surge
shortness of breath tachacardia hypertension on propranol ct clear from head to abdomen xray clear blood urine ekg echo clear no idea what?
propranolol is used to treat hypertension. it will generally lower your heart rate. a side effect however is bronchospasm (asthma) which could explain your shortness of breath. your propanolol dose is not sufficient to lower your blood pressure or heart rate but may be causing side effects so it shouldn't be increased. the best way to sort this out might be to try another antihypertensive.

have mucus that comes up into throat i assume from my lungs as my sinus' are clear. it has been going on for 5 years now with no diagnosis. feel bad and sometimes a little short of breath more a heaviness feeling. have had pft and test for asthma foo
asthma is still possible even if pft doesn't show it. less likely if you have had metacholine challenge not sure if that is what you mean by test for asthma. acid reflux is another possibility as well as occupational exposures to fumes or chemicals that may irritate your airways without actually causing asthma. i assume you don't smoke; if you do that would explain everything.
can diet or exercise help improve asthma in adult?

why does my breast implant feel hard? i've had my breast implants in for 3 years now and i've noticed that the right breast it feels hardened on one side. did it rupture? is this something to worry about?
when any implant is inserted the body reacts by forming a lining of tissue around it called the capsule. in some cases the capsule begins to shrink squeezing the implant that it surrounds. though the exact causes of capsular contracture are largely unknown there are factors that can contribute to this complication including: germ contamination during implantation seroma (the development of extra fluid around implant) hematoma (internal bleeding) infection smoking placement of implant above muscle (when placed bellow the muscle capsular contracture occurs with less frequency) depending upon the severity the breast can feel firm or hard become distorted and begin to cause pain. to cure or treat capsular contracture there are both surgical and non-surgical options. non-surgical prescribed antibiotics and vitamin e. while this is not always effective as a cure many surgeons will suggest that patients take a regular dose of vitamin e for the first year after augmentation as it helps to keep tissue soft. closed capsulotomy. the breast is forcefully squeezed in the hopes that the capsule pops or tears. this is not often done because it could cause the implant to rupture and may void the manufacturer's warranty. external ultrasound. may help reduce swelling and inflammation and does not involve any major risks. accolate. this anti-inflammatory used in the treatment of asthma has shown in minor studies to help regress capsular contracture. this is a relatively new and experimental treatment with no long-term statistical data. surgical open capsulotomy. the capsule surrounding the implant is surgically cut open in order to release the implant. after this is done however there is a chance of contracture occurring again. open capsulectomy. this is generally the most successful as well as the most intensive form of treatment. the entire capsule is removed allowing new tissue to form around the implant. in some cases surgeons will change the implant placement: for example if the implant is placed above the muscle the surgeon may place it underneath the muscle during capsulectomy in the hopes of better results.
heart rate at rest 120 on steroids due to asthma - overweight vicious circle of breathlessness = lack of exercise - how worried should i be?
yes. the oral steroid/asthma/under-activity/obesity cycle is easy to fall into and difficult to escape. however the tachycardia is not necessarily associated and may be a marker for other organ system(s)(cardiovascular) involvement. you need to see an asthma specialist and if you have see another one. otherwise this will only get worse!

can capsular contracture after breast reconstruction be fixed without more surgery? i'm worried about this possible side effect of breast reconstruction. my procedure will be two stages so between that and my original mastectomy three surgeries is plent
thei first goal is to prevent capsular contracture this is done by making sure the breast pockets are free of blood and infection. placing the expanders and subsequent implants under the muscle helps to reduce capsular contracture. early evaluation suggest that the use of accular dermal matrix may help reduce capsular contracture. appropriate drainage will help divert blood and other fluids that can lead to inflammation. i personally believe that early massage with a castor oil based serum is very helpful in maintaining soft pockets. this massage should be done for 4-6 weeks after each surgery. once a capsular contracture occurs it may successfully be managed early with massage castor oil based serum and the use of an asthma medicine such as singular or accolate (zafirlukast). surgery may be required in those patients who do not respond to non-invasive measures.

mediastinal adenopathy & left hilar adenopathy only with no other symptoms other than adult onset asthma 4 months ago? could this be cancer 51nonsmoker clean mamagram 2 please what else could it be
if you have no symptoms the radiologist is just commenting on a few big lymph nodes. there's no figuring out why one person gets a big spleen or a big set of nodes somewhere. these are very unlikely to be anything at all and if they are there's no reason to chase down an answer at risk to yourself to make the call early unless the masses are huge (your physician's call).

b-blockers result in bronchconstriction meaning the airways tend to close whereas b-agonists tend to bronchodilate or open the airways. so b-blockers may result in airway closure leading to acute asthma symptoms. (note: even b-blocker eye drops can have this effect! ) some b-blockers do this to a lesser extent than others so check with your doctor first.

this is a complex question with no simple answer. first of all stress tests although an excellent screening test can have false negatives. an excellent low risk test for coronary disease currently is a special ct scan called a ct angiogram or cta. is this the test you had? if so then your risk of coronary sources of your pain is probably negligible. secondly if you are having shortness of breath with a normal ordinary ct scan you probably don't have intrinsic lung (parenchymal) disease. this being said. there are other causes of shortness of breath. like asthma etc. some other chest diseases can cause chest pain and perceived shortness of breath like esophageal disorders. these are more common in patients with autoimmune problems like lupus.

i have asthma i get it from light exercise. i'm taking symbicort which gives me heart racing and anxiety. could i quit symbicort? my asthma is not severe never had it before.
mild/exercise induced asthma usually doesn't need a steroid controller medication. think about underlying food allergens stored toxins in the body as a cause. look at the a4m. com website "doc locator" to find a local functional medicine physician who can do a more thorough evaluation of why you have asthma and help you "fix it" so you won't need meds. start a daily probiotic like florajen to hlp.

i've mild asthma under control. why shouldn't i take beta blockers to control mvp without regurgitation? i'm taking diltiazem.
most asthmatics have a form of albuterol inhaler (e. g. proair ventolin proventil) for rescue use and many have salmeterol or formoterol inhalers. all these medications stimulate what is called the "beta-adrenergic" receptor (beta receptor for adrenalin) which causes the muscles around the broncial tubes to relax. beta-blockers block the beta-receptors making asthma worse in many individuals.
i've mild asthma under control. why shouldn't i take beta blockers to control mvp without regurgitation? i'm taking diltiazem.
there are beta adrenergic receptors in the heart (beta 1) the arteries and the airways (beta 2). in the heart it slows down the heart rate. it dilates the arteries. these actions help lower bp. however it can constrict the airways when beta 2 receptors are blocked which can be problematic in asthmatics. talk to your doc re cardioselective beta blockers which do not significantly affect asthma.

if you wheeze it is probably the asthma. shortness of breath may be either. cardiopulmonary testing can be done mostly at academic centers where they will be able to tell you what is the problem exactly.
i have graves disease im on 5mg of carbimazole but im still getting pulpitations i can't have beta blockers cause im asthmatic?
it sounds like hyperthyroidism is not being controlled medically. other alternatives include thyroid ablation with radioactive iodine versus thyroidectomy by surgery. should consult endocrinologist for recommendations.
i have graves disease im on 5mg of carbimazole but im still getting pulpitations i can't have beta blockers cause im asthmatic?
depending on how bad your asthma is i would suggest that you try a selective beta-blocker working together with your doctor. as often as not that may help your palpitations and not make your asthma worse. good luck!
i have graves disease im on 5mg of carbimazole but im still getting pulpitations i can't have beta blockers cause im asthmatic?
beta blockers as a class can cause bronchospasm and worsen asthma particularly the older generic ones such as atenolol metoprolol. the newer ones such as toprol xl (in the us) are more cardioselective and have less effect on the lungs.
i have been suffering from chest pain for 15yrs! it began when i was 18 years old. i was told its anxiety/costo. pain is reproducible and no breathlessness but hdl is155. my stress echo was perfect 5 years ago. thoughts?
asthma anxiety fibromyalgia systemic diseases bead through check up.
i am asthmatic & having palitation? what is the best drug?
palpitations would suggest a heart condition. a heart specialist would be the right physician to evaluate palpitations. the quick relief medication albuterol can lead to increased heart rate and possibly palpitations. for some people switching to lev-albuterol (xopenex) may help. controller medications like inhaled steroids do not lead to palpitations.
i have difficulty in breathing but my ecg and 2d echo results are normal my lung x-ray is also ok. but i have high level of bad cholesterol?
nothing you've got there has given you an answer yet. the most common answer of course are obesity and/or lack of regular exercise. if you exercise all the time and that's where trouble starts asthma or exercise-induced asthma is often to blame. cholesterol should have nothing to do with it.
i am an otherwise healthy 25 year old female with sinus tachycardia. i take nadolol to treat it. what could the underlying cause be?
usually this is due to a non cardiac problem like anemia over active thyroid or asthma. there are rare cases of unexplained tachycardia which can be treated with beta blockers like nadalol.
is possible for me to have respiratory problem and asthma even though my ecg is normal? i have frequent chest pain and dry cough.
yes the ecg is a test to assess cardiac disease only rarely will advanced lung disease manifest itself on an ecg.
is possible for me to have respiratory problem and asthma even though my ecg is normal? i have frequent chest pain and dry cough.
this is entirely possible.
i am atopic nd have asthma. using seroflo tabs for inhalation and mometasone furoate. chronic fatigue and palpitation. madical exam. cant study?
care by the people who are experienced it treating atopic dermatitis. please find a dermatologist who has the expertise in managing this dreadful condition! read this great article to find out more. good luck! <link>
i've had chest xray ekg n the doctor says heart is fine n strong but here lately i've had chest pains seems like the more i do it hurts?
chest pain associated with activities can still be heart condition acid reflux complicateted with esophageal spasm asthma/reactive airway disease chest wall pain. a stress test could be indicated even with normal ecg depending on your risk assessment. talk to your doctor.
i have asthma & have been having very frequent palpitations some days (like today). had ekg 4 days ago that was ok should i go see the doctor again?
your symptoms could be related to asthma or asthma medication but may also be unrelated. you should see your doctor again.
i'm having a ct heart angiogrami. i have been given ivabradine 5mg (mild asthma) i'm worried re my heart slowing down too much. i have brain aneurysm.
the pulse is slowed enough to gather good images of the mobile heart and arteries. they will watch bp and pulse carefully.
is it normal to have a rapid heartbeat &shaking unsettled unable to sleep &slight anxiety following a steroid cortisone 500 injection 4 asthma?
those are some side effects from high doses of steroids but can also occur with exacerbations of asthma.
i've been feeling a weird poking sensation on the left side of my chest. all my heart tests ekg echo ct angio and stress test came normal. i have asthma. what should i do?
poking doesnt sound like asthma. could be a muscle spasm or an extra heartbeat (usually harmless). it sounds like you've had enough tests. the ct scan would show if there's something out of place. maybe your body is telling you to lay off the cigarettes?
i've been feeling a weird poking sensation on the left side of my chest. all my heart tests ekg echo ct angio and stress test came normal. i have asthma. what should i do?
you are probably experiencing muscle pains from the chest wall. it is very unlikely that anything serious is wrong since your tests were ok. smoking however greatly increases your risk of developing serious diseases in the future.
i've been feeling a weird poking sensation on the left side of my chest. all my heart tests ekg echo ct angio and stress test came normal. i have asthma. what should i do?
pulmonary function testing and methacholine challenge testing and empirical treatment with electronic peak flow meter and bronchodilator are the main tests to check for asthma. discuss with your lung doc.
i've been having heart palpitations occasional skiped beats breathing deeply seems to alleviate them what causes this?
a good history and physical very important to find out the cause. could be just nothing. many people have skipped beats that after the million dollar work up turn to be benign. i have those. but possible causes are anxiety psychosocial stressors caffeine energy drinks hyperthyroid heart disease asthma side effects from medications. talk to your doctor.
i get bouts of tachycardia when overtired climb steep stairs/hills under stress or after hot showers. is this heart or asthma related?
your heartbeat to know if it is really tachycardia or just a pounding? it has to be over 100 to be true tachycardia. i see you have asthma so it could be your asthma and stress and activity sure could tip it off.
i get bouts of tachycardia when overtired climb steep stairs/hills under stress or after hot showers. is this heart or asthma related?
there are many possibilities: dehydration anemia asthma medication (albuterol) the asthma itself an unrelated heart condition and others. best to sort it out in person with your doctor.
i have lam disease -a rare lung disease. just diagnosed w/atrial flutter &prescribed metoprolol tartrate. any lung side effects from new med 2 watch 4?
in sensitive patients with reactive airway disease beta blockers may trigger airways spasm leading to asthma-like symptoms such as shortness of breath and wheezing.
what are the adverse effects of beta blockers during cardiac rehabilitation?
beta blockers are the drug of choice for cardiac patients for prevention of future coronary events. the drug can lower the peak heart rate during exercise. however patients can continue to get a good training effect even on the beta blockers. the benefits of the drugs far outweigh the potential risks unless the person has severe asthma that could be potentially made worse by the beta blockers.
in er for asthma while on monitor they said i had a short run of ventricular fibrillation it stooped felt flutter in chest. ovrnight no more. worry?
if they really meant ventricular fibrillation it can be fatal and will strongly recomend you to see a cardiologist for further evaluation with stress test and echocardiogram.
in hosp for asthma on monitr brief ventricular tachycardia overnight on monitor intermittent periods cardiac ectopy staying another night concerning?
part of your problem may be from over-stimulation from the beta agonist (brochodilator) use plus possibly oxygen lack and adverse effects from large dose of steroid given. but any arrhythmia especially ventricular tachycarida is of concern and you need a cardiologic evaluation after your asthma gets under control.
i have a pain in my chest. a tight feeling what should i do about it? could this be a heart attack? i am dizzy. feel tired and breathless
unlikely in your age. you could have asthma. or anxiety
is it always a problem for an asthmatic to have beta blockers before a ct cardiac scan to slow heart rate? thank you
it depends on how reactive or brochospastic your airways are. this is highly variable. some people tolerate beta blockers well especially the selective (beta 1) blockers. other people are exquisitely sensitive. also it depends on how long it's been since you've had an asthma attack. if you had one yesterday even if you feel well now you're not back to nl yet. if you've been well you're prob ok.
i have been short of breath at night and my heart rate at rest is 96 at night and i'm a 16 year old male. what does this mean?
asthma tends to be worse at night but you will have to be very short of breath to get a heart rate this fast. you need to see your doctor to get a check up which may include evaluation of your lungs heart and thyroid status. if you were female i would be more concerned with anemia.
what are the most common symptoms of beta blocker overdose?
airways and lungs breathing trouble no breathing wheezing (in people who have asthma) eyes ears nose and throat blurred vision double vision heart and blood irregular heartbeat lightheadedness low blood pressure heartbeat - rapid or slow heart failure shock nervous system coma confusion convulsions drowsiness excessive sweating fever nervousness weakness please call 911
what is my next move? shall i take her to a cardiologist for a second opinion? my 14 yr old daughter who has had asthma has been suffering from heart palpitations shortness of breath dizziness chest pains and fatigued for weeks. she has been off the as
palpitations are often nothing but teen years are when we see a spike in the diagnosis of svt. her asthma medicines will speed her heart rate anyway which might explain all but they could help trigger svt. a 24 holter monitor would really help if she is having palpitations on a daily basis. yes see a pediatric cardiologist.
what is my next move? shall i take her to a cardiologist for a second opinion? my 14 yr old daughter who has had asthma has been suffering from heart palpitations shortness of breath dizziness chest pains and fatigued for weeks. she has been off the as
if you are still concerned about your daughter then you should definitely see a specialist. it sounds as though her doctor has been pretty thorough with the testing he/she has ordered but if your daughter is still symptomatic it is worth looking farther for answers. call your child's doctor and ask for a specialist recommendation. good luck!
which one of these drugs can not be treatment for asthma-- metoprolol or zafirlukast.?
this is a beta blocker used to slow your heart rate. it has the potential to make asthma worse. zafurlukast is an oral drug used to treat asthma.
what are the side-effects of carvedilol?
most are not serious and may be a desired effect. slowing of the heart rate to make pumping of the heart more efficient as does lowering bp which the drug dose. at high doses it can cause bronchospasm of the airways so use with caution with asthmatics. in men it can cause ed although in a minority of patients.
icd 9 code for lower respiratory tract illness?
there are multiple different lower respiratory tract illnesses. bronchitis pneumonia copd asthma etc. etc. etc. you can probably pick your illness and simply google the icd-9 code. best wishes.
i have problems sleeping at night especially on a full stomach. i wake up gasping for air and heart racing. also a tightness in my chest. any ideas?
your symptoms are suspicious for a condition called sleep apnea which happens when your breathing pattern is disrupted during sleep. also asthma can present in a similar manner. sleep apnea is usually associated with overweight patients and asthma is normally associated with wheezing. luckily both are easily treatable see your primary care doctor for treatment options.
i am having arythmia palpitation and nervousness i don't want to take any albuterol or advair disc what other thing can i take?
albuterol may worsen palpitation shaking and nervousness. advair should not produce or worsen those symptoms. it is much safer than the oral pills for asthma.
i've been to er for ecg and doctor. 6 weeks after intravascular inject of lido/epi at dentist i still have shortness of breath. what could this be?
it could be many things such as anxiety asthma heart failure silent mi etc. the lidocaine and epinephrine is very safe when injected properly. if you still have sob you should definitely see a cardiologist rather than going to er.
i've been to er for ecg and doctor. 6 weeks after intravascular inject of lido/epi at dentist i still have shortness of breath. what could this be?
dyspnea or shortness of breath is an important symptom and before any other test understanding its circumstances is critical. have your been diagnosed with asthma? what were the circumstances that resulted in the lido/epi injection at the dentist office? is you shortness of breath continuous or intermittent? if intermittent are there specific circumstances to it: exercise anger pain?
is rightward axis and borderline ecg bad? arrhythmias for years 22 y old female asthma sleep eat well stressed tired could i have heartfailure?
based on the limited information it is unlikely that you have heart failure per se. however the arrhythmias asthma difficulty breathing weakness and borderline ekg needs medical further evaluation. please do seek medical evaluation as there are serious possibilities including blood clots in the lungs.
i have difficulty breathing and i can always feel my heart beat it shakes my chest and i saw a cardiologist but he said im fine i dont feel fine.
let your doctor know you continue to feel poorly. did you have a prolonged recording of your heart rhythm that correlated your symptoms with your rhythm? have you been checked for asthma? impossible to say what's wrong without knowing test results but even if "everything is alright" your doc can help with your symptoms. are you stressed? (anxiety can cause marked breathlessness).
i have copd and asthma i had a ecg done 2 weeks ago and had the results my left and right atrial are enlarged i am not on oxygen. any advice please!
it is very unusual just on the basis of copd and asthma alone to have both atria to be enlarged unless there is something else like an arrhythmia like atrial fibrillation which is not uncommonly associated with chronic lung disease. other causes like coexisting mitral valve disease would have been identified by the echo
i have copd and asthma i had a ecg done 2 weeks ago and had the results my left and right atrial are enlarged i am not on oxygen. any advice please!
an echo is the first screening test for "biatrial enlargement".
why don't we use beta blockers on patient with asthma and coronary disease?
because most asthma patients are on beta agonists (like albuterol) which open bronchial airways by relaxing smooth muscle in the airways. beta blockers do the reverse and would cause bronchoconstriction and thus worsen asthma or as least block the effects of the beta agonists.
why don't we use beta blockers on patient with asthma and coronary disease?
beta blockers generally exacerbate asthma as they block the receptors that open up the airways. think albuterol the mainstay of asthma treatment is a beta-agonist or exactly the opposite of the beta-blocker. however there are selective beta-blockers which act on the heart but not the lungs and may be used relatively safely in patients who have both problems.
whenever i feel short of breath i panic. i have been tested for asthma and have had lots of ekgs. but am almost constantly sob. what could it be?
panic can give you shortness of breath and vice versa. a number of young women suffer from vocal cord syndrome where their vocal cords contract and they cannot breathe. i wonder if you have been tested for that? see a good pulmonologist.
whenever i feel short of breath i panic. i have been tested for asthma and have had lots of ekgs. but am almost constantly sob. what could it be?
there are many conditions that are associated with a sensation of shortness of breath. it is best to continue to work through your physician to clarify other etiologies besides anxiety. for a list you can go here: <link>
why would a patients pulse rate increase when they're having an asthma attack?
because they can't breathe well they are hypoxic and the heart compensates by beating faster to get more blood volume through the lungs in the hope of getting it better oxygenated.
why would a patients pulse rate increase when they're having an asthma attack?
when faced with the onset of difficulty the stress response of the body kicks in. the adrenal glands kick in some cortisol & epinephrine. the epinephrine will raise the heart rate.
i have a tightness in my chest and neck and i feel like i'm going to have a heart attack. but the tests came back fine 3 weeks ago. what could be wron?
although you have had one normal work up there still does not mean you do not have a heart problem. other possibilities include lung problems like asthma infection or blood clot. you are young coronary disease less likely but other reasons for chest pain from your heart. anxiety and panic attacks can cause chest pain too.
why is propanolol or metoprolol contraindicated to patients who have asthma and copd?
they are beta-blockers and may cause bronchial constriction which exacerbates asthma and copd. we treat asthma with beta-agonists (albuterol etc) which are exactly the opposite. that being said metoprolol in particular is a selective drug and many asthmatics/copd-ers are able to take it if needed for heart disease without any ill effects. talk to your doctor.
why is propanolol or metoprolol contraindicated to patients who have asthma and copd?
these medications are beta-blockers which can act in many places in your body including your airways. the medications may worsen your asthma/copd by worsening lung bronchoconstriction (airway tightening). also makes it harder for asthmatics to respond to their rescue medications - which is a beta-agonist.
is there any danger in taking metoprolol and snoking cannabis? i know u shouldnt smoke but is there more danger with beta?
to be safe - legally and medically - keep this in moderation. that's a good thing in any case. the major risks for your medication are from classes of asthma drugs that have their effects increased to a dangerous degree. if smoking was to cause you to need asthma relief this might be significant. otherwise being moderate should keep you safe. best wishes!
what is the difference between cardiac cough and cardiac asthma? cough is not from medication or illness. have it with talking. have dcm.
cardiac cough can comes at night as part of the paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea from chf. cardiac asthma is bronchospasm/wheezing from pulmonary interstitial fluid accumulation from chf.
what is the difference between cardiac cough and cardiac asthma? cough is not from medication or illness. have it with talking. have dcm.
both refer to symptoms that are usually interpreted as pulmonary in origin but found to be from increased fluid in the lung from congestion from heart failure.
why am i freezing when air is set at 76-77 some shortness of breath. had ekg and chest xray. all good
go see your dr for a spirometry. you may have signs of asthma/ reactive airway or obstructive lung disease/ bronchitis or emphysema. if you smoke quit. best of luck!
why does the pulse rate increase during an asthma attack?
necessitates increased heart rate to deliver whatever oxygen is in the system.
i have high blood pressure and heart palpitations n paradoxical vocal cord disorder. i wk full time. everything plays up. what can i do?
i need more information donna. vcd mimics asthma and if you have high blood pressure and are on medication already there could be issues related to them causing your palpitations. i need to know what meds you are taking for both issues to make further recommendations. caffeine and alcohol could also be involved.
i'm 17 and i have panick attacks and anxiety disorder i have been prescribed 20 mg propanolol twice daily is this med safe for me?
discuss it w/ your doctor. if you don't have any condition that they warn against ie - asthma etc. then it is used for your conditions listed. these are not the primary purpose but that's common now. discuss why they chose this over other drugs for you - it's good to be informed about such choices by the doctor. best!
i have chronic asthma. i am on singulair (montelukast). i took flovent (2 puffs ) earlier this evening and my heart beat has been erratic. caused by the flovent?
this is not usually a side effect associated with flovent. it is definitely a side effect of albuterol( brand names proair ventolin for example). sometimes people gets confused which inhaler they are using when they have been prescribed more than one. double check on this since this is most likely caused by albuterol instead.
i have chronic asthma. i am on singulair (montelukast). i took flovent (2 puffs ) earlier this evening and my heart beat has been erratic. caused by the flovent?
is frequently associated with use of short acting beta agonist inhalers (sabas) such as flovent. this is generally fairly short-lived but it is possible that some patients may have more prolonged "palpitations" caused by increased heart rate (caused by beta stimulation) or irregular/skipped beats. if this is the case you should talk with your doctor about it asap.
i have chronic asthma. i am on singulair (montelukast). i took flovent (2 puffs ) earlier this evening and my heart beat has been erratic. caused by the flovent?
flovent is an inhaled steroid and does not cause palpitations. albuterol would be more likely to do so. now if the flovent is combined with another medicine (is there another word after fluticasone on the inhaler? ) then it would be a possible cause. if you have chest pain or dizziness with the erratic heart beat you need to be seen urgently.
i have chronic asthma. i am on singulair (montelukast). i took flovent (2 puffs ) earlier this evening and my heart beat has been erratic. caused by the flovent?
flovent is unlikely cause palpitations. it is a long acting steroid inhaler usually dosed 2puffs bid. the most important tool to monitor the asthma is your peak flow meter. take 3 readings am and pm average them and keep a record of the number. if your maintenance therapy of singulair (montelukast) and flovent are effective your # >450. if not your regimen needs reevaluation. ekg/ labs to evaluate palpitations
is severe ectopic heart beats dangerous w/ lack of oxygen to the heart w/ pulm stenosis h murmur and severe asthma? pulse is 120+ w/ heart medicine.
in general the answer would be no but your situation is quite complicated and you will need to discuss with your doc or cardiologist.
i've been diagnosed with cough-variant asthma clear xray and ecg. it presents primarily on the left side with wet cough and tightness. is this normal?
no cough perfect health is normal. cough variant asthma is more common than the public understands though. assuming the diagnosis is correct resist the urge to "throw antibiotics at it" and instead i hope your doctor is prescribing beta-agonists (albuterol) inhaled steroids (flovent etc) and maybe other adjuctive meds. if no improvement in a few weeks follow up with your dr.
what r the possibilities of chronic rapid heart beat near 100 and above in a 38 yr old female no heart condition at present?
i will recommend performing an ekg and a thyroid test to ruled our hyperthyroidism or graves dz more common in females. ekg to ruled out heart electrical conditions like pre-excitation syndromes like wpw. also be aware of excess in coffee and medications that will increase the heart rate. obesity and asthma will increase your resting heart rate too.
why has my doctor not checked for coronary artery anomolies excercise chest pain. had echo ecg stress ecg 24h ecg bloods. 21 male.
at 21 y/o with the above negative studies i can say with certainty that you do not have coronary artery disease. i will look for chest wall pain/costochondritis asthma induce exercise acid reflux that can mimic pressure chest pain like from the heart anxiety disorders. trust your doctor stay in shape do not smoke or drink eat healthy.
i went in for svt they queried p. e symptoms worsened repeated d dimer blood gasses low chest x-ray clear ecg clear today increase in breathlessness new pain when i breathe hence asking if d dimers can be false negative suffer aniexty which i'm being treat
good that you were checked but any blood test can give a false negative. nothing is 100%. however you had other tests that confirmed the lack of pe yesterday. could your problem be asthma? could it be costochondritis or pleuritis? since your symptoms have worsened you deserve further evaluation.
is it normal to have heart problems with asthma/acute bronch.? since i have been sick my heart beats fast when i lay down and it makes me feel weak.
it maybe a side effect (se) from your asthma medication. albuterol inhaled is very frequently used for asthma and frequently gives se of tachycardia ( rapid heart beat) and palpitations. talk to your primary doctor about it also you may have another associated condition that needs further evaluation and treatment.
i've been taking ventolin blue inhaler to control asthma but it makes me feel shaky and get palpitations. what should i do?
levalbuterol or xopenex (levalbuterol) inhaler tends to cause less tremor and palpitations than albuterol inhalers such as ventolin proair proventil. it is more expensive.
i've been taking ventolin blue inhaler to control asthma but it makes me feel shaky and get palpitations. what should i do?
commonly causes jitteriness and rapid heart rate but this effect is usually transient. if you are especially sensitive and bothered talk to your doctor about alternatives such as levalbuterol or ipratropium bromide.
why dose my heart hurt sometimes? i've been to a hospital because of my heart rate was to high and had to stay for 4 days then they said i was fine?
heart pain is probably your symptom. a common cause of cp in young males is chest wall pain/costochondritis acid reflux asthma pneumonia bronchitis. if the hospital said you were fine probably you don't have a heart disease. stay with your primary care doctor to find out the cause of your cp.
what causes rapid heart beat headache fever muscle aches and tender on right side of neck. i am 39yrs old female with asthma and high blood pressure?
it appears you have a viral upper fespiratory infection. . see your doctor for a throat culture to run out a strep throat.
how can i tell if i am having a heart burn or heart attack? it seems that symptoms of heart burn and heart attack are very similar how can i tell the differences and the warning signs before it's too late
there is no single test that distinguished one from the other. a heart attack is more likely if you are a man older than age 55 or a woman older than age 65 if you smoke have diabetes high blood pressure or have high levels of total cholesterol. it is more likely to be a heart attack if you have relatives who had a heart attack at an early age (men before age 55 or women before age 65) or you have had a heart attack previously. a heart attack is usually a feeling of pressure behind your breast bone which may radiate to the arms associated with exertion (activity) and relieved with rest or nitroglycerin. it may be accompanied by nausea vomiting sweating or feeling faint. it is less likely to be a heart attack if the pain is sharp or stabbing occurs due to a change in your position or with taking a deep breath. heartburn is a burning sensation in the chest that may radiate into the back jaw neck or arms and can be accompanied by a cough hoarseness difficulty or pain with swallowing vomiting and lung problems including asthma and pneumonia. it may resolve on its own or with the use of antacids. it occurs after you eat especially if you lie down soon after if you eat a lot of chocolate or peppermints if you smoke or drink coffee. because these types of chest pain are difficult to separate if you think you might be having a heart attack call 911 use nitroglycerin if you have it and chew on an aspirin while you await 911.
how can i get heart palpitations under control?
get plenty of sleep avoid stress don't smoke or use alcohol caffeine or energy drinks. avoid colas mountain dew dr. pepper diet pills and short acting asthma inhalers. if that doesn't work see your doctor for further testing.
is it normal to feel your heartbeat even when it's at 68 bpm and i've had all tests holter monitor stress test and echo and bloods and all was normal i also get sob so what could it be? .
do you have overweight problem hypertension or asthma? you can consult me or one of us for more info. .
is it normal to feel your heartbeat even when it's at 68 bpm and i've had all tests holter monitor stress test and echo and bloods and all was normal i also get sob so what could it be? .
not so common yet does not mean a problem. people commonly ignore their heart beat consciously. yet given intensity of the muscle contraction including resting rates & heart outputs becoming aware not that difficult with practice & focus. study: <link> for some basics of heart function. better able to monitor than oblivious. sob c/w anxiety ? asthma etc. stress tests=zero value
what can i take for arythmia palpitation and nervousness if i don't want to take albuterol or advair?
you should talk to your doctor about managing your asthma with other medications that have less side effects. there are other options for you.
is cardura (doxazosin) a reasonable second bp drug with lisinopril when ccbs diuretics beta blockers are not well tolerated? also on b-agonists for asthma.
cardura (doxazosin) or another alpha blocker type drug is an option when the other classes of drugs mentioned are not well tolerated. alpha blockers can cause dizziness so they are best taken at night to minimize this effect. the dose needs to be increased slowly. make sure you are exercising and minimizing salt alcohol and caffeine as well.
will gerd cause asthma and heart palpitations?
gerd can cause wheezing and palpitations.
why does my heart rate rise to 110 beats per minute when i eat gluten it's normally 60?
this is a classic sign of food allergy in fact arthur coca md wrote a classic book "the pulse test " describing a fast pulse after eating a food as one of the best ways to diagnose food allergies. gluten sensitivity is an extremely common problem that can cause fatigue insomnia asthma depression anxiety etc. see <link> consider a trial of gluten avoidance for several weeks.
went to er getting pvc's about once every 6 beats. took blood count great. electrolytes/kidney function great. do these test mean my arteries r good?
more than 5 odd heartbeats per minute is worrisome. i trust you've got coffee use limited and aren't using an asthma inhaler. i'm less worried about your coronaries electrolytes & kidneys than a possible channelopathy or conduction pathway defect. if this persists a cardiology consult may be in order; a holter monitor and/or a special ekg may be in your future. stay proactive.
how is vasovagal syncope related to the autonomic nervous system?
your autonomic nervous system (ans) controls virtually all the organs and systems in your body. if your parasympathetic (pns) is hyper you could have urgent urination diarrhea gas bloating watery eyes allergies asthma low blood pressure. the vaso-vagal response is caused by excess pns tone which will lower pulse and bp at the same time. the vagus nerve is a major player in pns.
heart symptoms worse with beta blocker-what is this?
beta blockers slow the heart rate and reduce the force of contraction of the heart. in cases of slow heart rate and weakness at baseline or low bp these meds could make a person symptomatically worse. this might also happen in cases of acute asthma.
heart racing hard to breath weak rib's sore headache asthma dizzy no equallibriam?
you really need to be evaluated immediately. you should go to the er so you can be evaluated and treated. shortness of breath especially with your other symptoms can be life-threatening so go to the er so this can be diagnosed and treated urgently. good luck!
heart racing hard to breath weak rib's sore headache asthma dizzy no equallibriam?
you sound as if you are quite ill. strongly recommend going to nearest emergency room and be seen quickly.
i am experiencing burning in my chest at night similar to breathing cold air with chest tightnes. i also feel random sharp chest pains. i have had 4 ablations in 18 months for afib.
in view of your history of afib cardiac causes of chest discomfort and possible blood clots(emboli) to the lungs must be considered. your cardiologist who knows all your findings is best qualified to evaluate and advise you. noncardiac causes include pinched intercostal nerves asthma equivalent or other lung or esophageal issues.
i have a tightness in the middle of my chest when i laugh sometimes. i have seasonal asthma and recently has perfect ekg. is this my asthma? anxiety?
pain in the chest with inspiration or cough is usually a pulmonary issue. see your md to make sure
why does your pulse go up when you have a cold? i have asthma and i feel like my heart pounds when i have a cold?
fever almost always increases heart rate. your pulse probably goes up because you have a fever.
how to get a fast heart beat besides exercising and drinking caffeine?
fever anemia pain anxiety panic/fright asthma inhalers amphetamines cocaine hemorrhage excess thyroid hormone infection epinephrine dehydration congestive heart failure carbon monoxide poisoning - there are many more: i can't think of them all!
i've had chest pain for the last 2-3 years. i am going to the cardiologist this upcoming monday and get an ekg. i'd like an idea of what this is. thx!
given your age and how long this has been happening the likely cause is asthma related. you will certainly need a complete work up to rule out anything dangerous. anxiety can also cause chest pain as well.
why when i get a pvc i feel a quick instant loss in breath and sometimes cough? this is so scary and starts my worry and anxiety
actually the underlying lung issue (copd asthma bronchitis or emphysema) can be one of the causes of premature ventricular contraction which is the result of the left ventricle of the heart contracting too early before receiving the expected signal from the sino-atrial node. hypoxia or a lack of oxygen in the blood can lead to this issue.
what causes taccycardia and a feeling of restlessness?
the list of things causing tachycardia and restlessness is much longer than this space allows. for instance -- the effects of many drugs like asthma medications being hyperthyroid withdrawing from alcohol or benzodiazepines etc. heart arrhythmias can cause these also. please see your own physician who knows you and your medical history. if these symptoms are acute and severe go to an er.
how come the nurse wanted to give an ekg test for asthma?
if you were in an emergency room and showed up breathless even if you say you have asthma they need to make sure it is not your heart making you ill or asthma plus a cardiac condition.
how come the nurse wanted to give an ekg test for asthma?
ekg is typically not needed for evaluation of asthma. it may have been indicated for something else. for instance if a patient presents with asthma exacerbation but also has a rapid heart or complains of chest pain physician may order an ekg to rule out a cardiac reason for these symptoms.
i have had asthma since a child. i am using salbutamol 4mg every night and also the ventolin inhaler. i have had an ecg and it shows sinus arrhythmia?

why does postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome cause fast hr if the blood pressure stays normal? doesnt make normal physiological sense.
if it made sense it would be physiologic. it's not. it's pathologic. for example: breathing passages that swell up when exposed to smoke makes no sense but when it happens we call it asthma.
with carcinoid syndrome is flushing constant and is diarrhea and pain present. i have facial flushing +palpitations menopause 9 yrs ago?
carcinoid syndrome causes episodic flushing diarrhea and palpitations. other things can cause these symptoms and you mention one of them-- menopause. i notice you have asthma and if you use albuterol inhalers they can definitely cause those symptoms. steroids like prednisone can also cause this as can anxiety dumping syndrome and a host of other things. see a doc to get this sorted out!

i was taking formoterol (in a spray) in the same time as clarithromycin (twice a day). now i'm worried about prolonged qt but i feel very well. should i be frightened? my heart was always healthy.
although clarithromycin may cause problem for people with prolonged qt the incidence is quite low. if you don't have this ekg finding don't worry about it. millions have used this combination without any adverse effect but it is good that you are aware of this potential problem. clarithromycin does not work on a viral infection. if you have asthma exacerbation you need more than formoterol.
why do bronchodilating drugs (such as albuterol) cause rapid pulse nervousness and anxiety even when used as directed?
the medications you mention do that as part of their intended action. that's how dilation works. it's not an asthma cure but rather symptom relief. it mimics the release of adrenaline effects on our body that increase heart rate and breathing capacity to allow us to fight or flee is what it does. the tightness opens but our heart also races and it's like we're being threatened. ok?
why do i have skipped heartbeats? is that because of stress? how can i protect against stress? thanks <positive_smiley>.
stress is a factor. other possibilities include: nicotine caffeine lack of sleep asthma meds. understand: everyone has skipped beats everyday but we normally don't notice them. if yours aren't improving over the next week get checked by your doctor to be sure there's nothing else going on. there are meds if you need them that can help.

wanted to know if beta blockers like nadolol (corgard) really lessen the effect of the albuerol treatment for asthma?
betablockers can precipitate broncospasm and they antagonize the beneficial bronchodilatory effects of medicines like albuterol.
what to do if i have hypertropic cardiomyopathy and asthma and i smoke. how harmful is it to me?
smoking is just about the worst possible thing you could possibly do. in addition to making your asthma worse you increase your risk of a fatal cardiac arrhythmia (which is what people with hcm die of) about 300-500%

had pvc's. only 2% of heart beats were those. why is stress echo necessary if i have had no sypmtoms for 3 weeks and cholesterol is amazing. ?
pvc's are common and assuming you had holter monitoring more than half would have asymptomatic pvc's. if you use albuterol for asthma it can cause palpitations and pvc's by increasing your heart rate. stress echo at your age is being done as an added test to evaluate for any structural abnormality (eg mitral valve) or hypertrophy of left ventricle may unmask inducible arrhythmia.

my heart rate is 70 to 80 normally but at random times i have a weird feeling in the heart area so i check it and it between 100 to 120. why?
if you have asthma treatment with beta agonist inhaler may increase your heart rate. dehydration may increase your hr. are you having any associated symptoms with the palpitation like chest pain shortness of breath ? occur you changes in position like sitting/standing position? do you drink coffee soft drinks with caffeine energy drinks? all above can increase your hr.
wheeze upper chest cough non specific changed t waves on ecg normal bp and oxygen help?
this is most likely a pulmonary issue possibly asthma or an upper resp infection (viral vs bacterial but unless fevers and chills - probably viral). the nonspecific t wave changes are just that and likely unrelated to this acute episode unless you have other chf symptoms (fluid overload decreased energy level etc)
ive had mycoplasma pneumoniae infection for two months im being treated with doxycilyne. how long for tachycardia and chest pain to go away?

my heartrate is 124 at rest & can feel it beating. last week at the dr my bp was 109/77. labs came back as elevated wbc. any thoughts why hr so high?
i see in your profile that you take albuterol do you recall taking it the day of your exam? this will make your heart beat fast. if your asthma is not controlled well you should have your doctor adjust your asthma medications. you don't say how high is the wbc count this is relative and may or may not be concerning.
my doctor told me my heart palpitations are benign but they have gotten worse since then. they even keep me up at night and cause difficulty breathing?
that decision? ekg holter test stress test thyroid test? are you having anxiety attacks? here is few causes of benign heart palpitations: excess caffeine energy drinks cold medicines dehydration pots( palpitations appearing after assuming standing position from sitting) streets drugs like marihuana asthma/allergies hyperthyroidism (associated with sweating tremors headaches).
metropolol vs. digoxin. which will cause shortness of breath?
if you have asthma and or have copd you should not be using the medicine.
may ventolin be taken together with a beta blocker? what are the consequences if i already take both of them together?
most beta blockers work 12-24 hours but if you have asthma then you should be avoiding beta blockers if you can or have your doctor measure your lung via puulmonary function test if it affects you. recent data still shows that it can exacerbate asthmatic attacks but if you have tolerated it for a long time then your md will weight the risk and benefit.
metropolol and now coreg (carvedilol). sinus issues. why do beta blockers cause this. any suggestions as to one that may not?
beta 1 is found in the heart b2 receptors are found in the lungs and respiratory system. if one takes a beta blocker that it nonselective it can act on the heart and lower the blood pressure but can act on the lung and potentially cause a cough. this is why beta blocker can potentially cause coughing in asthmatics. you should talk to your pcp if symptoms or side effects continue. good luck.
wheezy chest heart rate is fast. every time she coughs she vomits. can't stand for too long what shall i do?
take her to a physician asap urgent care or er. she may have asthma pertussis heart failure pneumonia. time to get an exam and xray. keep her hydrated with fluids. vomiting losses need extra fluids to make up for them. in the er iv fluids can be given and at least anti-emetics to ease the nausea and vomiting and anti-tussives to ease the coughing.
what is used calcium and glucose in case of faintness state (with tachycardia respiratory insufficiency pallor poor view and hearing) for?
in the short term low blood sugar is more dangerous than high level and so rapidly giving sugar for suspected symptom is a safer bet. i doubt that u had low calcium--as u likely would have experienced muscle spasm etc. but giving u some may reduce the risk of cardiac rhythm trouble. i would recommend checking with doc to see why u had trouble breathing.? asthma? good luck
iam 68 years old great health runner never smoked. been having periodic shortness of breath and some chest pain. first xray diagnosed copd?
though copd is more common in smokers it is not exclusively a smoker's disease. your job environment improperly controlled asthma may also contribute to copd.
had huge thunder storm and lightning an hour ago which sent me in shock and my pulse still high at resting 108bpm and also asthmatic which chest still constantly playing up finished oral steroids?
you need to focus on trying to calm yourself down. first off do you have an inhaler for your asthma and can you or have you used it? please do so. then focus on taking long slow and deep breaths continuously and close your eyes and try to think of something that is soothing to you. if it helps to lay down with a blanket or pillow for comfort please do that as well. i hope this helps.
i get shortness of breath when standing up. sometimes i get chest tightness. and very rarely mild chest pain. i am 18 with normal echo and ekg. is it cad?
could be gastritis. try ranitidine/ prevecid. normal echo/ ekg eliminates lots of conditions- abnormal heart wall thickness mitral valve prolapse abnormal rhythms. did you have a stress echo test? that may tell a bit more as you see heart response to stress/hyperactivity. check pfts for asthma and tilt table test for autonomic dysfunction like orthostasis or tahycardia (pots). f/u w/doc
my palpitations are sometimes feeling like airway is tightened wen they happen for a sec. should i get second opinion 4heart disease? i hav anxiety 2.

would it be safe for me to go scuba diving when i have a heart condition and palpitations leaky valve and a prosthetic heart valve and asthma?
we can often provide some medical advice based on the information you provide in the question. however the question you ask would require that we have a full history exam and list of meds. becoming certified to do scuba would likely require medical clearance before a reputable source would let you rent the equipment. talk to your treating docs and see if they think it is wise/possible.
would it be safe for me to go scuba diving when i have a heart condition and palpitations leaky valve and a prosthetic heart valve and asthma?
without knowing the specifics of your 'heart condition' the valve situation and asthma i would have to caution you against diving. it is best that you check with your own cardiologist for questions like this.
would it be safe for me to go scuba diving when i have a heart condition and palpitations leaky valve and a prosthetic heart valve and asthma?
i don't think so but review your cardiac disease with your cardiologist who knows your heart. you might stick to snorkeling. all the best.
i had an ekg and pulmonary test done which came back fine. i was a little winded during pulmonary test. doctor on here thinks it's allergic asthma. can i have that without it showing up on my test?
when you have a problem it is going to show up on the test. there is a possibility any mild problem may not show up on the test
i had an ekg and pulmonary test done which came back fine. i was a little winded during pulmonary test. doctor on here thinks it's allergic asthma. can i have that without it showing up on my test?
didn't mention what kind of pulmonary test you had possibly spirometry. being little winded during the test is common but a single measurement just an indication for possible further testing like giving a bronchodilator and comparing the results before and after. another could be a challenge test or exercise testing. keep the follow up with your doctor/asthma specialist to rule it in or out

it would be a good thing if what you experience as a little winded is not severe enough to be a finding. that means even your 'bad' is not very bad. do take it seriously to avoid allergen (if possible) and use tx as directed or do alternative breath work etc. good news possibly!

why did propranolol give me a bad cough a hard time breathing? atenolol does not give me these symptoms why did the 2 have different reactions
propranolol is not selective for b1 and b2 receptors while atenolol in lower doses only affects periphery ( b2) receptors which doesn't work on your heart that much. do you have asthma? propanol is even worse for people with asthma.

a stress test at your age can be misleading. it is less accurate in women than in men. it may still be a good option. you should discuss your symptoms with your doctor before deciding the next step. a good history and physical examination can often help determine the source of the pain and/or the best way to determine the cause.
slight chest discomfort when playing basketball. i do have mild asthma but never wheeze. i had 4 clear ekgs should i ask dr. for stress test? no family history of heart disease. normal cholesterol.
you can probably tell better than anyone whether your chest discomfort is chest-wall pain from the body movements of the ball game cough-variant asthma (i have this and recognize the discomfort in the chest it can cause on exertion) or the real fear-inducing pain of coronary disease. i'm assuming you have no heart murmur to suggest hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and are cocaine-free.

you need a complete history and physical examination with a clear exposition of your symptoms. it is not at all clear what you are feeling and thus speculating on tests without specific information isn't a good idea. you should discuss your situation with the doctors who've seen you and have an idea of what your symptoms may be. you mention wheezing and asthma may be an explanation.

(2)you may have caught a viral infection from someone in the gathering (or even from a week earlier). if you start to have a fever or muscle aches then a viral infection would be the answer.

breo has a long acting beta agonist to dilate your airways. coreg (carvedilol) is a beta blocker which tends to act against the bronchodilator. with asthma a cardioselective beta blocker is preferred if absolutely needed. in general it is better to avoid using a beta blocker unless there is no better substitute.

do you have a fever or chills coughing? any history of asthma? any h/o reflux esophagitis? i'm glad your ecg and echo were done and fine. does your chest hurt when you push on it? it would be rare to still have a cardiac problem without family history and with your normal heart studies. is your trouble breathing due to chest pain hyperventilation wheezing or stuffy nose? breathe into paper bag.
rapid heartbeat is a physical response to stress i heard. what else is?
acute stress-fight or flight response: shallow breathing dry mouth sweats tremor dilated pupils urge to move bowels palpitations; tingly fingers toes lips from overbreathing (hyperventilation); insomnia; irritability. any all or other. chronic stress can result in more subtle responses as well as muscle tightness spasm asthma (if predisposed) trigger autoimmune problems etc.
rapid heart beat at rest reason to call doc?
normal hr at rest is around 60-100 bmp. sometime emotional excitement even when you are resting it can be a bit fast. also if you have taken some cold medicine/decongestants or too much caffeine/energy drinks or all of the above together can really speed up your heart. asthma medicine--albuterol etc. can increase hr. so if u have no reason for fast hr consult doc. good luck.

two negative d diners normal ecg cough chest tightness extreme aniexty convinced i have clot docs won't further test?
pulmonary emboli or blood clot in lung. . is an acute illness in general. if you have been dealing with this for some time that is reassuring. as are your symptoms. the cough and tight feeling suggest your airways (bronchial tubes) may be "spasming" or contricting. like from asthma or other rarer conditions. the d dimer test is very helpful when negative. it virtually means no clot in body.

there are many causes of cough few that can cause chest pain. if you are having shortness of breath with it i would be worried about a pulmonary embolus. could also be cardiac related especially since it gets worse with lying flat. potentially could be asthma (based on symptoms you describe). best bet is to be seen.

lung congestion for 3 months with throat clearing and loss of voice. have asthma allergies gerd and svt. not getting better. any smells exacerbate.
spirometry is a measurement of airflow in the lungs. testing both before and after the inhalation of albuterol can be used to determine your response to medication. the use of inhaled controller medications for persistent symptoms is part of the regimen used for contolling asthma. in addition controlling triggers such as gerd and allergic exposures are important. your svt requires your md's input.

it is unlikely cardiac with the tests being normal. anxiety is possible if your symptoms are intermittent. gastric reflux can cause chest discomfort but the numb chin is strange. underlying asthma could cause symptoms but you should have a cough or wheezing. hyperventilation could cause both (with fast breathing) but this would not be constant. lastly inflammation of the breast bone joints woul
patient has been on coreg and was just prescribed ventolin hfa on an as needed basis. is this combination okay? this is the only beta agonist the patient is on and i know that coreg can cause shortness of breath and maybe even asthma which is why i think
consider using healthtap prime to flesh out these answers. coreg (carvedilol) can cause shortness of breath but it is an important medication in the treatment of high blood pressure & heart failure. ventolin can counteract some of its (side) effects. coreg (carvedilol) generally spares the lungs but that isn't true for all people (some react to it differently than expected). there may be alternatives - talk to a doctor.

"trouble breathing" means one needs to see a doctor because it can be many things such as an allergic reaction a heart problem pneumonia etc. . trouble breathing can also be due to asthma-type symptoms if the person is prone to getting such problems with any cold flu allergy or strep symptoms. in some cases trouble breathing can be due to huge tonsils or a tonsillar abscess.
why does my 'asthma' make my heart rate slow down (51 - 59bpm) instead of speeding up?
good observation but that might indicate severe acute asthma rather as the pulse is expected to rise during inspiration it rather falls due to severe airways obstruction so filling of the heart rather gets reduced during inspiration which is supposed to be increased complex. at any rate this is just a postulate if you are suffering you need to follow up with an asthma specialist goodluck
whats the difference : psvt and sinus tachycardia? been told have nocturnal sinus tachycardia since my early 20's lasts few mins with fast regular bpm
psvt comes in bursts and frequently is symptomatic while st is usually more persistent. your history of mitral valve surgery frequently makes you more likely to have this and ventolin can make it worse. there are other inhalers that are not as likely to cause it--see your doctor. it can also mean that your mitral valve needs more attention. inderal can make asthma worse by the way.
when a heart beat fast it can cause asthma?
your heart is a separate organ and has nothing to do with starting asthma. it will beat faster any time you have a stressful event like an asthma attack but it is responding to the hormones of stress not triggering your asthma.
what should the o2 saturation be for a co2 level of 33? my mom has copd chf asthma afib. she has an o2machine at home. is 5% too high?
your mother's situation is complex & i can't make sense of your question since the o2 saturation measures oxyhemoglobin & co2 measures carbon dioxide pressure. (they can be unrelated). 5% o2 saturation is too low - not compatible with life - for arterial blood. do you mean 5 lpm on the o2 tank? use healthtap prime or ttyd to get correct answers because there's no way to answer using 400 character
hello i experienced minor shortness of breath and slight dizziness last night. my ecg shows sinus bradycardia at pulse rate 47. i am 22 and a smoker.

just read my inhalers side effect of low potassium. i have never been tested for this any idea why?
i take it that you are inhaling a glucocorticoid. very high systemic doses of a glucocorticoid will lower potassium; the tiny doses you inhale for asthma are unlikely to produce this effect as it will be overriden by your body's ability to cope. the warning is there for the lawyers. and a low potassium would show on routine blood work should you become ill.

my chest feels tight no pain and i think i have avid reflux. it got better last night but it's still happening today. is that a problem?
challenging to sort out chest issues. chest tightness in a 22 year old woman may be related to asthma gi problems like reflux heart issues etc. it actually would be unusual for acid reflux to cause tightness without any pain/burning discomfort. this requires collecting a careful history about frequency intensity character aggravating factors etc. see you doctor for the necessary eval<positive_smiley>
my chest feels tight no pain and i think i have avid reflux. it got better last night but it's still happening today. is that a problem?
might be reflux but if smoke or on birth control could be pulmonary emboli[blood clot ] much worse risk if do both. could be asthma too if wheeze. reflux usually has acid taste in mouth heartburn to lessen it eat 6 smaller meals to avoid overfilling stomach and thus reflux thru valave between stomach and esophagus elevate head of bed 6 inches on blocks to help gravity push food down
my doctor told me to stop taking the propanolol 60mg er after a month what kind of side effects are there and will they be bad? it's been two days
it depends on why you were taking it. if for palpitation they may return if for high blood pressure it may go up unless you are on other medications if for anxiety it may return. if you have asthma and propanolol was making it worse your asthma may improve. would call you doctor and discuss the reason why he stopped it and if you should slowly taper it off rather than cold turkey. .

what should i do about shortness of breath? i am feeling short of breath but can breathe. should i go to the emergency room or just go see my doctor?
i will get into some specifics in a minute but will summarize first- shortness of breath can mean a lot of things many of which are quite dangerous. so yes you should go to an emergency room. now to answer your question in more detail. when i see a patient who is complaining of shortness of breath- i always think of certain disease processes and try to rule them out either with testing or by historical information and exam. asthma is common but unlikely to present in adulthood. pneumonia is common usually accompanied by fever and productive cough. pulmonary embolism (a "blood clot" in the lungs) is often (but not always) preceded by leg pain and swelling is more common in women the elderly people with cancer smokers and overweight people. congestive heart failure is usually preceded by heart problems or a history of high blood pressure and often the patient will also have leg swelling. certainly heart attacks can present with shortness of breath and no chest pain. as you can see all of these potential problems (and many more) would require a doctor's evaluation as soon as possible.
what should i do about congestion and trouble breathing in the mornings? every morning i wake up congested and short of breath. i don't have any pets and no known allergies. the congestion goes away as the day progresses. what could be causing this?
there are many different causes of feeling the sensation of shortness of breath the most serious of which are those arising from a heart or lung problem. some causes of feeling breathless manifest with subtle patterns e. g. with symptoms that change with the time of day. only a detailed history and examination from your doctor can help provide a clue what the cause of the symptoms could be. for example feeling shortness of breath due to congestive heart failure can result in feeling breathless when lying down flat (e. g. on a bed) or in the middle of the night. conversely symptoms of asthma are typically worse in the mornings and slowly dissipate through the day. this however is not specific for asthma as conditions such as hypersensitivity pneumonitis (inhaled lung allergies) for example can arise from something as simple as your down-comforter. this will result in feeling breathless in the morning when you are exposed to a down-comforter and go away during the day when you are away from your bed. this example illustrates the complexity of trying to determine the cause of feeling breathless as many people will not know if they can be allergic to something like a down-comforter unless they see a pulmonary specialist. coexisting symptoms such as congestion can also provide a clue with regards to the cause but again the type of congestion matters. chronic nasal congestion (blocked nose) suggests a problem such as allergy-related. feeling congested within the chest especially in association with wheezing suggests asthma.
