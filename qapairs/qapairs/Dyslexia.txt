speech therapist told me that omega 3 helps with speech delay. is this true? if so how many mg. daily for my 2 1/2 year old daughter?
suggested a slight + effect but i have not seen it replicated although mcgill university started a study in 2012. safe doses have not been established for toddlers. it's important to have her early intervention program test overall development & to seek early childhood special education services thru your school district at 3. even an isolated expressive language delay confers risk of dyslexia.
