what is diabetes mellitus? how prevalent is this type of diabetes and what are the health risks?
diabetes mellitus (dm) is a condition characterized by abnormally high levels of glucose (sugar) in the blood. insulin is the predominant hormone involved in regulating blood glucose levels. type 1 dm is caused by a lack of insulin. this was formerly called juvenile onset diabetes and is the result of damage to the insulin-making cells in the pancreas. type 2 dm is caused by insensitivity to insulin meaning that although the pancreas continues to produce insulin the body responds to it less. type 2 dm was formerly called adult onset diabetes and is far more common than type 1 dm. type 2 dm is more common in overweight and obese individuals and is also associated with hypertension and abnormal cholesterol. dm is a chronic condition with many health risks if not adequately treated. the biggest risk is cardiovascular disease as people with dm have high rates of coronary artery disease and heart attacks. people with dm are also at risk of kidney disease eye disease nerve disease and skin infections. early type 2 dm can often be treated with diet exercise and also oral medications. insulin injections can be required in more advanced type 2 dm in order to overcome the body's insensitivity.
