thoughts? could one day of binging and purging hurt me?
even one day of binging and purging can cause electrolyte changes that can pose a risk to cardiac function. also violent vomiting can cause esophageal rupture. pacreatitis also can happen. however one day is usually not the case and this sounds like bulimia nervosa. eating disorders ultimately destroy one's quality of life. treatment should be sought if these behaviors continue.
