you have a condition called intertrigo which is caused by yeast (usually candida albicans) infecting your skin. these organisms thrive in moist warm conditions such as the folds beneath your breasts or lower abdomen. diabetics are particularly likely to develop intertrigo as their immune systems don't work well and elevated blood glucose levels encourage the growth of yeast. keeping the infected areas clean and dry is an important part of treating and preventing intertrigo. (this can be difficult if you're obese. ) avoid using powders that contain cornstarch which may aggravate the condition. topical antifungal medications such as clotrimazole and terbinafine will help but you may need to get a prescription for an oral antifungal such as diflucan (fluconazole) from your doctor. as long as you're obese you'll probably have recurrent problems with intertrigo. your doctor has no doubt discussed this issue with you. i've attached a link that provides more information about intertrigo. i hope things go well for you! <link>
