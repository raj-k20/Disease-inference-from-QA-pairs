i got my stool tested amd cysts of eh were seen. please suggest what should i do. i took this test because i have ibs so please suggest a diet plan too?
treatment for entamoeba histolytica is your first step ; depends on the degree of infection (e. g. liver involvement extraintestinal manifestations) as well as the efficacy of clearing intestinal cysts. if symptomatic much of your distress may resolve with eradication of eh. persistent diarrhea or ibs-like problems can then next be dealt with.
