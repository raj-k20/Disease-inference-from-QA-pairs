are chronic leukemia and breast cancer related?
patients with chronic leukemia are twice as likely as the general population to develop other malignancies including breast cancer. this likely has to do with chronic leukemia patients having a genetic predisposition compromised immune systems or just generally being older.
are chronic leukemia and breast cancer related?
a very interesting question. there may be a higher incidence of breast cancer in women with chronic lymphocytic leukemia but there is no association with chronic myelocytic leukemia. mouse mammary tumor virus can cause both breast cancer and lymphocytic leukemia in mice. whether this has anything to do with humans is under investigation.
is a high neutrophil band count normal if you've been diagnosed with breast cancer?
bandemia- can be seen in different conditions such as in serious infection or due to certain medication like gcsf- given to support your white blood cell while receiving chemo; or in separate primary bone marrow/ blood problems- like in chronic leukemia for instance. if you are receiving gcsf ( neupogen/neulasta) after your chemo- you could see bands on your blood count -and it is okay. d/w md.
