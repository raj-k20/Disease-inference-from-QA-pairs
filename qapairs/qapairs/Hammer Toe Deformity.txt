what is the best way to treat hammer toe ( little toe)? i am using a silicone gel tube & wider shoes but still have pain.
wearing gel tubes and constantly wider shoes puts you in a position of ever increasing concern for an ever increasing severity of the problem. altering the toe position through several optional surgical procedures are usually the best way to treat a stubborn hammer toe deformity of the little toe.
