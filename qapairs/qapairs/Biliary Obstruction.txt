what liver disease causes yellow eyes?
almost any liver issue can ultimately include jaundice or yellow eyes. this would include biliary obstruction hepatitis and cirrhosis to name a few broad areas.
i have rather white stools the past few days a bit unwell a bit gassy but no pain. i had gastric sleeve surgery 15 months ago. gall bladder?
white pale stool may reflect a significant biliary obstruction or profound liver disease (often with accompanying jaundice). or the white may be just a coating of mucus (a colon lubricant) which when present in large volume may signal problems with colon spasm (ie. irritable bowel syndrome) partial obstruction infection and even sloughed colon lining due to a variety of diseases. get checked.
