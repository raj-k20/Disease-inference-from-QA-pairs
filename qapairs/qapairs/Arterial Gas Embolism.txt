what is arterial gas embolism in simple terms?
i'm assuming you mean an "air embolism. " it's when air gets into an artery and the air bubble gets jammed up further down the line. at that point blood can't get past the air; serious consequences or no consequences at all can result depending on where the blood flow blockage occurred.
