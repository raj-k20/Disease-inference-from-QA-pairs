why does my right hand keep getting numb i am 43 y/0 am on metformin for type 2 diabetes and am also haveing left shoulder pain. my hand isn't pain?
it could be carpal tunnel syndrome. diabetics are predisposed to it. further history and an exam by your physician should be able to help diagnose it. other less likely possibilities are cubital tunnel syndrome and diabetic peripheral neuropathy (though you didn't mention your feet tingling or being numb).
