what diet/strenghtening is best with metabolic myopathy?
it is not clear what you mean concerning metabolic myopathy. many conditions affect muscle metabolism. most common is the use of steroids then the diabetic state and then congenital disorders of metabolism. one common condition is carnitine deficiency. supplemental carnitine may be of value with little side effect. basic good nutrition and appropriate exercise is also important.
my muscle biopsy showed mild fat storage in the cell. my free carnitine is low and lactate in the 24h urine collection is higher. what is my problem?
we do not know your history as to why the muscle biopsy and carnitine levels were done. carnitine deficiency can be genetic called spcdorsystemic primarycartdeficiency inborn error of fatty transport. it can cause muscle weakness cardiomyopathy hypoglycemia and liver dysfunction. acute episodes usualy follow fasting vomiting or infections. it is more common in faroe island(danish) need echocardiogram

is synthesized in the body and is found in meat as a nutrient. although it is important there is no evidence that taking it as a supplement makes any difference unless you have proven carnitine deficiency.
