my ct scan shows low potassium and thickening of the bladder walls what does this look like for me?
it's impossible for a ct scan or any imaging modality to show low potassium (k+). many conditions and medications can lead to low k+. a thickened bladder wall can also be secondary to various conditions most comonly to bladder outlet obstruction. unfortunately it is difficult to give you an answer which such little info and with only 400 characters well you get the pic.
