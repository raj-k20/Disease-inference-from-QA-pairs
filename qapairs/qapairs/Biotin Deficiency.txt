does biotin make some women lose weight?
if you don't have a biotin deficiency which is very uncommon taking a biotin supplement will do nothing for you. biotin is needed for normal metabolism but it will not improve it if there is no deficiency. as it is water soluble the body will not even store it so it offers no long-term benefit. it plays no role in weight loss in the absence of deficiency so adding more doesn't help.
