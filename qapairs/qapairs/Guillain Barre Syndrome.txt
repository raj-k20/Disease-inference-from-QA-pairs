a family member had guilliane barre last year now my son is expected to get a tetanus shot for school. is it safe for him heard this is dangerous?
according to the national vaccine information center (<link> nvic. org) there is a causal relationship between tetanus shot and guillain barre syndrome. gbs is rare but must be identified early to be treated appropriately. tetanus is a deadly disease contracted through inoculation of spores of clostridium into the body through a wound. as with any concern discuss it with your provider.
