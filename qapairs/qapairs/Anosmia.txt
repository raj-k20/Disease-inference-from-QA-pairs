nasal polyps is common cause for anosmia in patients with rhinitis. especially if she has had chronic rhinitia and only anosmia started 4 months ago. a short course of steroids (can affect diabetes control) or ent injected steroids can give temporary relief. nasal steroid sprays with help them shrink. i have found fulnisolide (it stings a little) to work better than most. have her see her doctor.

rhinitis may be due to allergies or infection. anosmia suggests a more serous problem they needs md attention to examine and run tests if indicated.
