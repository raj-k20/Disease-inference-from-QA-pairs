is there an autoimmune disorder that would cause htn polydipsia bone pain low k+ renal stones lethargy palpitations etc?
have you got conn's? a renal tubulopathy? a genetic potassium wasting / fanconi syndrome? don't focus on autoimmunity just because of the huge amount of "pop" writing about it -- an immune interstitial nephritis is low on my list for you. low potassium is a huge red flag. has your vitamin d been checked -- it's a very common cause of bone pain though not the rest. best wishes.
