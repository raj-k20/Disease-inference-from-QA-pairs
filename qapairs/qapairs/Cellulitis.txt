with five admissions sounds like you need to seek advice outside your current circle of experts. i am betting you never had an elevated white count or fevers and so repeated antibiotics are fruitless. get to a wound care center where they can evaluate you for venous insufficiency and venous ulcers. no antibiotics are needed to treat this and long-lasting relief is a few weeks away.

is it normal for itching and redness to persist after a full course of antibiotics for cellulitis caused by staph?
it is possible for skin to stay slightly red and itchy as inflammation resolves. that being said if you haven't noticed much improvement over the course of the treatment then you may want to be re-evaluated. it is possible that either its not cellulitis or you aren't taking an antibiotic that is effective against your infection.

sometimes the area of skin overlying an infection can be itchy for a while after the infection is gone.
is it normal for itching and redness to persist after a full course of antibiotics for cellulitis caused by staph?
staph infections can cause all kinds of problems for your skin. even after finishing a course of medication your lymphatic system may be damaged or may be draining away the damaged tissue from the site of infection. it would be worthwhile to keep in close contact with your physician for areas that do not continue to improve after stopping the antibiotic therapy; you may need a 2nd course.
is it normal for itching and redness to persist after a full course of antibiotics for cellulitis caused by staph?
lymphedema which is sudden swelling of skin is the cause of itching - skin is stretched suddenly beyond its elasticity to alleviate this apply calamine lotion to skin. fill old long socks or stockings with packaging popcorn styrofoam peanuts and tie the socks/stocking use this padding one on top of leg another on calf side and use acewrap apply this in the morning remove at night. itching will go.
i am recovering from cellulitis. i was discharged from hospital about ywo weeks ago. i am on iv sntibiotics and unna boots. i have chills. is this ok?
cellulitis is an inflammation (red hot swollen and tender) of the skin and soft tissues. it can be caused by many things such as bacteria sunburn vein disease and trauma all of which have different treatments. depending on where it occurs and what is the cause the treatment changes. if you keep having recurrences the treatments are wrong seek another opinion. try profore instead of unna's.
i am recovering from cellulitis. i was discharged from hospital about ywo weeks ago. i am on iv sntibiotics and unna boots. i have chills. is this ok?
you may have a bacteria resistant to the antibiotic you are on or you may have developed an abscess (infected pocket) that antibiotics do not treat. either way you need to be evaluated by a physician.

is there a link between cellulitis and surerficial thrombophleditis?
in fact superficial thrombophlebitis is often mistaken for cellulitis (and vice versa) but we work hard to distinguish the two because we treat them very differently.
is there a link between cellulitis and surerficial thrombophleditis?
cellulitis is a soft tissue infection of the skin and subcutaneous tissues. superficial thrombophlebitis is blood clots in the small superficial veins under the skin. these blood clots can become infected causing suppurative thrombophlebitis and can have surrounding cellulitis.
i have cellulities and been following treatment like it should but for two days i've been having fever of 105 should i go to the hospital?

go back to your surgeon to have it examined. it may not be but the risk of waiting is not worth it.
i had a lateral release on my knee 5 months ago got cellulitis immediately after surgery and now my knee is warm to the touch. could it be infected?
certainly sounds possible- let your surgeon take a look at it.
i had a lateral release on my knee 5 months ago got cellulitis immediately after surgery and now my knee is warm to the touch. could it be infected?
difficult to say without an exam. usually celulitis will resolve with oral antibiotics. the question is whether your knee warmth is due to inflamation or a low simmering infection. certain blood tests as well as possibly drawing fluid from the knee for culture might be necessary. i would check back with your surgeon for re-evaluation.
i got diagnosis with cellulitis at the corner of my lips. it flares up routinely after being diagnosis in dec. what antibiotic would be helpful now?
it sounds like stomatitis with inflammation rather than cellulitis. use l-glutamine 2gm twice daily for 2 weeks with riboflavin 100mg three times for 2 weeks to heal mucosa. do aloe cleanse 3 day of 1 bottle 32 oz aloe followed by 4 day of activated b complex by isotonic do this cycle x 3 to heal mucosa completely.
i got diagnosis with cellulitis at the corner of my lips. it flares up routinely after being diagnosis in dec. what antibiotic would be helpful now?
did you get diagnosed with cellulitis or more likely chellitis? the later is helped by watching how often you moisten the sides of your lips with your tongue(need to keep as dry as possible) and may be helped with the use of a multivitamin orally and vitamin e cream locally.
i got diagnosis with cellulitis at the corner of my lips. it flares up routinely after being diagnosis in dec. what antibiotic would be helpful now?
this is likely a case of angular cheilitis and not cellulits. angular cheilitis can be caused by the following: candida malocclusion riboflavin deficiency iron deficiency antibiotics will not help this condition. hope that helps!
i have what i believed was an ingrown hair but now it has swollen turned red and it drained to what looks like a huge empty hair follicle! cellulitis?
your description suggests a single follicle was involved draining pus- likely an abscess. if there was surrounding redness swelling tenderness and warmth then a cellulitis was involved. see a doctor for abscess drainage and treatment- a culture will be needed to determine what caused the infection (eg. community-acquired mrsa).
i have what i believed was an ingrown hair but now it has swollen turned red and it drained to what looks like a huge empty hair follicle! cellulitis?
it sounds like you may have had a furuncle (aka boil or abscess). now that it has drained you are left with an abscess pocket. you also may have secondary cellulitis (infection of the skin). you should see your doctor. why? to screen you for mrsa to treat your cellulitis and to decolonize you for mrsa.
i have what i believed was an ingrown hair but now it has swollen turned red and it drained to what looks like a huge empty hair follicle! cellulitis?
ingrown hairs can lead to infections and cellulitis and most will resolve. they can spread rapidly however and some will become abscesses so should see your doc and see about antibiotics or if further drainage is needed. can place neosporin until then.
is breast cellulitis common in early pregnany is it dangerous my doctor prescribed dicloxacillian 4x a day for 7 days.

i have popeye elbow from getting cellulitis. no injury. 3 weeks only slightly better. will it eventually go away? motion range is normal
it might resolve with antibiotics but sometimes the swelling will persist without infection from inflammation in the olecranon bursa which is under the skin at the tip of the elbow. it can be drained and sometimes treated with cortisone. rarely the bursa will need to be removed with surgery.

i have a bad abcess with cellulitis on my leg i don't have insurance is there anything i can do at home to help and can cellulitis cause chest pain?
while i sympathathize i would not advise trying to treat what you describe as a bad abscess at home. typically this will need antibiotics and incision/drainage. an urgent care can likely do this for you reasonably cheaply. sometimes the abscess may spontaneously rupture and drain and you could place a warm moist towel to try to expedite this but you need to see a doc. chest pain needs doc.
i have a bad abcess with cellulitis on my leg i don't have insurance is there anything i can do at home to help and can cellulitis cause chest pain?
besides soaking it and hoping it opens up and drains at home one must be very cautious with these type of sores. they can get ugly and dangerous very quickly. if it is increasing in size or more spots are becoming abscessed you will need to get to the county hospital or the public health clinics where you live.

it's best not to drink alcohol while taking an antibiotic.
i am going to a cinco de mayo party and i am currently on clindamycin for cellulitis. can i drink alcohol or will it interfere with the medication?
while it is unlikely to cause you any serious harm the alcohol could certainly effect the efficacy of the clinda and it's possible the clinda could effect your reaction/tolerance of the alcohol. you are unlikely to find a physician to condone the use of antibiotics and alcohol for these reasons so you will have to decide for yourself i'm afraid.

i'm sorry you're so uncomfortable. the relationship between your cellulitis and your chronic heel pain is worrisome. in some cases the bone beneath an infected area of skin is invaded by the same bacteria that are responsible for the cellulitis. this results in osteomyelitis which can smolder for many months or even years. while your x-ray most likely would have revealed some changes consistent with osteomyelitis sometimes a bone scan or mri are needed to detect subtle cases. in many instances osteomyelitis is accompanied by low grade fevers night sweats or some other telltale symptom. alternatively your case of cellulitis may have triggered a condition called complex regional pain syndrome (crps) or reflex sympathetic dystrophy. this poorly understood condition usually follows trauma or surgery to a limb but any significant inflammatory insult can set it in motion. crps can be stubborn particularly if it isn't recognized early. treatment includes physical therapy medications (e. g. gabapentin) botox or even surgery to ablate the nerves that serve the painful area. i've attached a couple of links that might be of interest to you. if you haven't seen your doctor for this problem recently i would suggest a reevaluation. good luck! <link> <link>

this is obviously due to infection of some type but diagnosing whether due to the bacterial cellulitis becoming systemic or to secondary viral illness is impossible over the net. because the risk is great if this is bacterial infection would urge you to go and see your doctor immediately. since cellulitis is most often due to strep pyogenes or staph aureus these infections have fatal potentials.

bacteria in the blood can attach to the heart valves which causes a vegetation. the condition is called endocarditis. endocarditis can result in sustained bacteria presence in the blood as well as the bacteria can erode the valve or valve structures making the valve leak. if significant valve leakiness (regurgitation) occurs it may have to be surgically replaced.

unless your father has dripping wounds that are not contained by bandages your risk is relatively low. washing of hands with soap for at least 30 seconds is a must for everyone in the household or who comes into contact. of course no sharing of towels or other garments. common sense is most important here.
my father has cellulitis is it contagious to me? he has been prescribed keflex as an antibiotic.
infectious cellulitis is not a superficial infection rather one of the subcutaneous tissues just under the skin itself. as a result there would have to be an openening in the skin for this to be possible although even then the risk is fairly low. furthermore many other kinds of inflammation of the skin masquerade as infection but aren't especially in the leg.

my dr. prescribed me systemic vibramycin (doxycycline) for a mild cellulitis in my upper eyelid dt. mosquito bite. is this effective? !
the swelling from a mosquito (and other insect) bites is usually an allergic reaction to the proteins and toxins in the bite and rarely due to infection. vibramycin (doxycycline) in this context is precautionary but usually not necessary. you might need and anti-histaminic if the swelling persists. infection would be denoted by a pus filled pocket but again this is rare.

swollen red skin after mosquito bite especially on an eyelid is a local reaction to mosquito saliva. it is not cellulitis therefore the antibiotic is ill- considered. furthermore why vibramycin brand rather than generic doxycycline? probably no harm but always some chance of unwanted effects as well as waste of money if taking antibiotic when no infection is present.

orbital cellulitis with a abscess behind the eye! will this always need surgery as well as iv antibiotics? what is the correct path of treatment.
if there is an abscess in the orbit it needs to be drained with iv antibiotics. we worry that the swelling in the orbit compromises the optic nerve either by direct compression or orbital congestion. usually both iv antibiotics and abscess drainage are needed
ok so my cellulitis is healing pretty good but a lot of pus is oozing from the spot it started and there are scabs around it is that normal? or not?
sounds like you have an abscess which is draining some. see your family doc. the site probably needs opened and flushed. of course why do you have a cellulitis in the first place? diabetes morbid obesity. address the root cause(s).
ok my cellulitis is from a bug bite and it has scabs around the bite is that normal?
normal. if you have cellulitis & it isn't being treated - please get med follow up. when was your last tetanus shot?
once cellulitis has been cleared with antibiotics can they bacteria lay dormant in your body and flare up again?
nope if cleared up from the antibiotic then the infection should be gone from your body. it can always come back due to the bacteria on your skin but its not because it was dormant inside your body.
once cellulitis has been cleared with antibiotics can they bacteria lay dormant in your body and flare up again?
unless the original infection was caused by resisint bacteria such as mrsa: uisually most physicians use double antibiotic therapy to treat cellulitis and to avoid resisitance or recurrence. if you had additional abscess formation this could be an issue- consult your physician.
once cellulitis has been cleared with antibiotics can they bacteria lay dormant in your body and flare up again?
don't lie dormant internally but they are always on the surface

not possible to answer this. details of "cellulitis"? where? what symptoms? reason for cellulitis? culture? which antibiotic? route of administration dose? 4 of 5 diagnoses of "cellulitis" by non-dermatologists are actually something else. if it is not cellulitis it will not respond to an antibiotic. if the cellulitis is due to lymphedema or venous congestion it is imperative to attend to the und

should i still have pain three days after starting antibiotic treatment for cellulitis by surgical incision on posterior. pain is better but significa?
obviously pain is normal in the area of a surgical incision particularly if you developed cellulitis. if it doesn't seem like it's getting better on the antibiotics it is possible that an abscess is forming under the skin. see your surgeon for an exam. may also need to order imaging studies to try to see what's beneath the skin. hope this helps and best of luck!

pain secondary to superficial injuries is often more intense than deeper wounds due to close proximity to the nerve endings. that being said often times patients (and physicians as well) see tissue covering active wounds as scar or healed when in fact the wounds are continuing and may worsen or progress. with a history of previous cellulitis this should probably be checked professionally.
today a scar from an abrasion ( which got cellulitis) this past june peeled open and a stabbing/searing pain pulsed in my scar. is that bad?
what was the cause and where is the wound 1. a foreign body was lodged under the skin and either worked its way out or became infected or was never infected but inflamed in the first place 2. that wasn't scar but some dead material called escar 3. infection of underlying tissue or bone below the site with this scenario it would be worth your time to see a wound specialist i am in lafayette.

are diabetics at risk to develop cellulitis? why?
diabetics are more susceptible to cellulitis for several reasons. first diabetic nerve damage can decrease sensation especially over the lower extremities leading to ulcers where cellulitis can develop. often diabetics also have poor circulation which can lead to breakdown of tissue and impaired healing and the high blood sugar provides a perfect environment for bacteria to grow.
are diabetics at risk to develop cellulitis? why?
anyone can get cellulitis. if someone has poorly controlled diabetes their immune system will be weaker and diabetics can have circulatory issues and all this predisposes diabetics to cellulitis. <link>
are diabetics at risk to develop cellulitis? why?
a few ways to think about this. diabetes compromises circulation so if there is a site of injury/infection and the circulation there is poor it will have a problem healing on its own. bacteria love it and cause cellulitis diabetes compromises nerves and sensations. simple cuts and scrapes get missed and simple skin infections get caught much later. important to check your feet regularly!

do not stop taking the medication your doctor has prescribed before they are all finished. you have dose and a series that is designed to be effective against bacteria and you do not want to have bacteria exposed to the antibiotic and survive the exposure. such sensitized bacteria bread a new strain that are resistant the the antibiotic and render it less effective in the future. the only reason to stop taking the pills is if your doctor tells you to do so so ask first. the unfortunate side effect from taking such a powerful antibiotic is that you can get a runny tummy. i suggest you take yogurt and eat cereal to fill and repopulate the gut tract with new bacteria. yours is a good question and it show that you are a compliant patient to have asked first. i hope that helpd dr. neil mcleod dds dentistry that lasts - quality that counts.

bactrim ds 800. 2x daily for cellulitis. how long before improvement. i'm on day 3. if i were to have an allergic reaction would i know by now.? ty
usually for cellulitis we expect to see some improvement by day 3. the problem these days is that germs are increasingly resistant to medications. if there's no response at all - then this needs re-evaluation. bactrim has lost some effectiveness over the years - particularly against strep species which can cause cellulitis. the thing to note is 'allergy' can arise at anytime while on medication

cellulitis in ankle/calf. er visit had iv antibiotics and pills swelling went down but redness has worsened and moved completely to top of foot?
to revisit the er it sounds as if the foci of the infection is in the foot and you may have an abcess that needs to be drained. i would ask them if that is possible to bring it to their attention. the cellulitis had to start somewhere perhaps between your toes secondary to a fungal infection but i would go back.

you don't "catch" cellulitis. runny nose + low fever = virus not related to antibiotic. does "strep" mean strep throat? you have not described "cellulitis". this is not a stand-alone diagnosis. exactly where and exactly what symptoms? 90% of "cellulitis" diagnoses by non-dermatologists are wrong. most cellulitis is caused by staph sensitive to duricef (cefadroxil). question this diagnosis and consider another
