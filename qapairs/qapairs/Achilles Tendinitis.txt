what is causing pain in the back of my heels (not bottom). i am slightly over weight.
heel cord strain/achilles tendinitis is a common cause of pain in the back of your heel. make sure you are doing your stretching exercises your shoes are of good fit and type for your feet and not wore out. if these things are not helping see a podiatrist.
