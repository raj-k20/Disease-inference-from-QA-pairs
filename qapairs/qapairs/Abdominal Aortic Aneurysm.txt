what to do about panic due to aortic aneurysm? my poor sister has a 5. 2cm aortic aneurysm. it hasn't grown in a year but she's really overweight and panics every time she experiences an odd sensation because she thinks she's going to die. should she be
her aneurysm is close to the size where it should be considered for surgical repair typically 5. 5 cm for either a thoracic aortic aneurysm or an abdominal aortic aneurysm. it sounds like she has it evaluated annually which is the recommendation. it is also crucial that she controls her blood pressure and cholesterol and that she not smoke. weight loss would be beneficial but should be done with the guidance of her physician in order to avoid too much stress on the aneurysm. it is important to monitor symptoms because chest or abdominal pain can herald a potential aortic catastrophe; but in some people this vigilance leads to anxiety. it is important that she focus on the correct symptoms and not attribute all symptoms to a possible aneurysm. the symptoms she should look for depends on whether the aneurysm is in her thorax or abdomen and could be explained to her by her physician. if she experiences anxiety as a result of her medical condition she may be an appropriate candidate for anxiety medication.
i can see the pulse in my abdomen though i'm not skinny (normal weight bmi 24). should i be worried about an aneurysm?
arteriosclerotic abdominal aortic aneurysms occur male/female 2:1 60y/o+ specially if smokers although i have done coronary bypass surgery followed by repair of an abdominal aortic aneurysm on a 42 y/o male this is not common. people with collagen diseases can develop aortic aneurysms at younger age. historically syphyllitic aneurysms have occured but other infectious organisms are more common.
could i have an abdominal aortic aneurysm that i cannot feel through the fat?
you could have an abdominal aortic aneurysm that you cannot feel but at your age it would be unlikely. chances of having a small aneurysm increase if you smoke or have a family history of aneurysm disease.
could i have an abdominal aortic aneurysm that i cannot feel through the fat?
the aorta lies deep in the abdomen actually against the spine. so it is difficult to feel in obese individuals. given your age an abdominal aneurysm would be unlikey. an ultrasound of the abdomen is a good imaging modality to evaluate the aorta.
would ecg + xray of chest and blood tests find aorta anyurism. pulsating stomoch. i have anxiety an last night was first time to sleep in a week.
an abdominal aortic aneurysm is a very uncommon occurrence in a 19yr. old. blood tests a chest xray and an ecg are not the examinations to detect it. if your dr. is truly concerned an ultrasound of the abdomen/aorta may be indicated in the correct clinical situation.
i can feel my heart beat in my stomach is it possibly an abdominal aortic aneurysm?
at thirty-five it is unlikely you have developed an aaa but it's not totally impossible. you could have some degree of high blood pressure which perhaps makes your pulsations more noticeable. if you are very thin it's not that unusual to notice your aortic pulsations. my advice. discuss this with your doctor. good luck.
i can feel my heart beat in my stomach is it possibly an abdominal aortic aneurysm?
feeling a heart beat in your stomach could represent an abdominal aortic aneurysm. the normal aortic pulsation can be felt in most skinny people. it would be unusual to have an aortic aneurysm at your age. an ultrasound can be arranged by your doctor to answer the question if need be.
if i can feel my heart beat in my abdomen and i have middle back pain could this be an aortic aneurism?
abdominal aortic aneurysm would be very unusual in a 22 year-old. it is also not uncommon to palpate a normal abdominal aorta if the patient is thin.
i'm very thin and can feel my pulse in my belly. family history of aaa. ultrasound showed normal. is my risk high.? female 25
while there may be a slightly higher hereditary risk for abdominal aortic aneurysms most of the risk can be controlled i. e. don't smoke watch your blood pressure keep your cholesterol and fat levels under control exercise and watch your weight.
is it normal to feel my heartbeat in my stomach. i feel it on the lower left side. i have been diagnosed with h. pylori and i am wondering if it is r?
you are feeling the pulse from the great vessel called abdominal aorta -- and it has nothing to do with your stomach or h. pylori you could ask your doctor to examine -- and make sure it's not abdominal aortic aneurysm
how can i get the stomach virus and when do i get it? is it dangerous? does it has heartbeat? coz the one moving in my tummy has a heartbeat
are you sure you've got a "stomach virus? " viral gastroenteritis will not cause a pulsation. if this pulsating is of recent onset you need to go to a hospital urgently. abdominal pulsations unless you are very thin may be a sign of an abdominal aortic aneurysm--i. e. a tear of the large artery in your abdomen carrying blood to your legs.
my stomach keeps moving up and down constantly and the same rate as my pulse why could this be happening?
if you are very thin your abdomen may go up and down with the pulsating aorta. on the other hand it is best to make sure that you don't have an abdominal aortic aneurysm causing the pulsating. best to consult your doctor to see if an abdominal ultrasound may be needed.
there is a heartbeat in my stomach. why? there is also this lump that comes and goes but it also moves up in down in my stomach. why?
worst thing could be an abdominal aortic aneurysm. speak to your doc and you might need an ultrasound exam of abdomen.
very strong heart beat like pulse in stomach. left side. is this just my aorta? worried could be aaa. i'm 16 and female.
you are just feeling the pulsation of your abdominal aorta. abdominal aortic aneurysms are rare in women under age 55 y/o and are 6 times more common in men than women. particularly in smokers. in one population study of 6386 people there were no abdominal aortic aneurysms under the age of 48 years old.
very strong heart beat like pulse in stomach. left side. is this just my aorta? worried could be aaa. i'm 16 and female.
it is very unlikely to have an abdominal aortic aneurysm at age 16 unless you have marfans syndrome. a good history and physical is recommended

a ct of the chest performed to look for a pulmonary embolus would reveal a thoracic (aortic) aneurysm if you had one but might miss an abdominal aortic aneurysm.
would a ct scan show an aneurysm?
a ct scan would usually show an aneurysm but it depends where. if you are looking for an abdominal aortic aneurysm a non contrast ct is adequate. if you are looking for an intracranial aneurysm a ct angiogram with iv contrast or an mra would be indicated.
what is the best procedure to fix an aneurism and bulging disk on l3 and l4 section on the spine and followup recovery?
assuming you're talking about an abdominal aortic aneurysm this is unrelated to bulging discs although each can cause back pain. if aneurysm is under 5 cm it usually is not treated. if over 5 cm it is treated either by a stent or open operation to replace aorta with graft. bulging disc treatment depends on symptoms. evaluate by spinal surgeon.

would xray be able to recognize an abdominal aortic aneurysm?
although regular x-ray test can occasionally diagnose an aneurysm (if there is calcium buildup in the aneurysm wall) the test is unreliable. the main tests used for diagnosis are either ultrasounds or ct scans. mri is also useful. the particular test that is best will depend on the location of the aneurysm. brain aneurysms typically by ct or mri and other aneurysm often ultrasound initially.
would xray be able to recognize an abdominal aortic aneurysm?
many aaas have a calcified wall making them visible on plain x-rays but since many do not have the calcium an ultrasound or ct scan would be the test of choice.

although it is not entirely clear as to what causes aneurysms there is a definite familial predisposition to their development. if a parent or sibling has or have had an aneurysm it is important to be checked. this can be done simply and easily with an ultrasound. contact a vascular surgeon and have the test done at an icavl accredited vascular laboratory.
what can cause an abdominal aortic aneurysm?
we are not quite sure what actually causes an aaa to form in some people. the leading thought is that the aneurysm may be caused by inflammation in the aorta which may cause its wall to weaken or break down. most believe that this inflammation can be associated with atherosclerosis (also called hardening of the arteries) or risk factors for atherosclerosis such as high blood pressure and smoking.

what is the mortality rate for abdominal aortic aneurysms?
rate of rupture: 5 to 6 cm is 5 to 15%; 6 to 7 cm 10 to 20%; 7 to 8 cm 20 to 40%. also if the aneurysm increases in size by 8 mm in a year the risk of rupture is high even if less than 5 cm. hence not only is attention paid to the size but also the rate of growth. once it ruptures the mortality rate is greater than 50%. the key is to repair before rupture either by surgery or stent graft.
what is the mortality rate for abdominal aortic aneurysms?
the risk of rupture for aaas is associated with the diameter of the aorta. hear are some rough rupture risks. <5cm 3%/yr 5cm 6%/yr 5. 5cm 7. 6%/yr 6cm 7-10%/yr 7cm 25%/yr 8cm 40%/yr. the risk of a major adverse event from an elective aaa repair is less than 3% (roughly). eighty percent of people with ruptured aneurysms traditionally don't make it. these stats have improved w/ stents.
what is the mortality rate for abdominal aortic aneurysms?
risk of rupture increases once the aneurysm reaches 5cm diameter such that the risk of surgical repair to avoid rupture is less than the risk of rupture at that point.

what is the mortality rate of abdominal aortic aneurysms?
the risk of rupture for aaas is associated with the diameter of the aorta. here are some rough rupture risks. <5cm 3%/yr 5cm 6%/yr 5. 5cm 7. 6%/yr 6cm 7-10%/yr 7cm 25%/yr 8cm 40%/yr. the risk of a major adverse event from an elective aaa repair is less than 3% (roughly). eighty percent of people with ruptured aneurysms traditionally don't make it. these stats have improved w/ stents.
what are treatments for abdominal aortic aneurysm?
if it is not tool larger medicines to control your blood pressure will help prevent it from getting larger. however if it is expanding rapidly or is large then there is the danger of it rupturing which could be fatal. depending on the location and size sometimes this can be repaired with a stent meaning that no incision is necessary. otherwise an open operation is needed.
what are treatments for abdominal aortic aneurysm?
if greater than 5 cm in diameter then the treatment is either surgery or stent graft.

there are a number of both open surgical and "endovascular" methods to repair aaas. have your doctor send you to see a vascular surgeon who is trained specifically to fix them.
what is the post-operative care of abdominal aortic aneurysm?
there is a big difference between an open repair and an endovascular repair. open repairs require aggressive cardio-pulmonary resuscitation post-op. depending on the extent of the repair patients are often kept intubated the first night. endovascular procedures are typically less of a physiological burden on the body and patients are extubated the same day and typically go home the next day.
what is the post-operative care of abdominal aortic aneurysm?
for open repairs one goes home working on return to normal diet and activity level in a gradual fashion. surgical clips from the incision closure are usually removed at 14 days post-procedure. endovascular repairs are typically easier with two small groin incisions to recover from. your diet has not really been altered in that procedure.
what is the post-operative care of abdominal aortic aneurysm?
patients go home in a day or so. wound care at groin incision. light activity for 2 weeks.
what is the pathophysiology of abdominal aortic aneurysm?
the exact mechanism for aaa formation is not known. there are several etiologies/theories. the most widely accepted is that aaas form due to an inflammatory process in the wall of the aorta associated with atherosclerosis. inflammatory cells are thought to degrade structural proteins (such as elastin) in the wall of the aorta weakening it and allowing for aneurysm formation.
what is the pathophysiology of abdominal aortic aneurysm?
of the aortic wall secondary to atherosclerosis or connective tissue disorder.
what is the pathophysiology of abdominal aortic aneurysm?
the exact mechanism remains under investigation. there are differences in proteins and other elements on a molecular basis when comparing normal aortic walls vs ones with aneurysms though the mechanisms responsive and how to manipulate those mechanisms remain under investigation.
what does a tortuous abdominal aortic aneurysm mean?
the term "tortuous" simply means: full of twists turns and bends. in medicine we use this to describe the pathway of veins or arteries. when either veins or arteries "grow" to become varicose veins or aneurysms not only do they grow in diameter but also in length. as they grow longer they start bending and twisting to accommodate and "fit" into the same body.
what does a tortuous abdominal aortic aneurysm mean?
it may or may not be consequential. on the other hand it may cause decrease in blood flow or have clot in it. so tortuosity per se is not the key issue. rather the associated finding that comes with it.
what does a tortuous abdominal aortic aneurysm mean?
it simply means it does not lay in a straight line. you might also say it follows an erratic path rather than lying more or less in a straight line.
why is the abdominal aortic aneurysm more common?
the aorta the main artery that delivers blood from the chest to the belly has a protein known as elastin in its wall. smoking and copd affect biochemistry destroying elastin leading to weakening in the wall causing it to bulge out forming an aneurysm. why most common in abdomen? cause elastin layer is thickest in chest thins at renal arteries in abdomen - no surprise they often form there 1st!
why is the abdominal aortic aneurysm more common?
we are not sure why this is the case. the most widely accepted theory is that aaas arise from an inflammatory process related to atherosclerosis. the inflammatory process is believed to degrade the elastin in the wall of the aorta thereby weakening it. we do not produce elastin as adults. why this process happens most often in the abdominal aorta is not clear.
will a descending thoracic aortic aneurysm get smaller or disappear?
aneurysms tend to grow slowly over time: for abdominal aortic aneurysms about 10% of their diameter per year for thoracic aneurysms maybe slightly less. risk factors for growth include uncontrolled hypertension and smoking.
what are causes of an aortic aneurysm?
about 5% of men over the age of 65 have abdominal aortic aneurysms. risk factors include: increasing age male sex family history of aneurysm (may increase your risk 4-fold) hypertension and history of smoking. dissecting aneurysms can be caused by localized damage to to the artery from hypertension or trauma (deceleration or sheering-type injury) or catheter injury from an angiogram.
what is an infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm?
infra renal aneurysm means it is involving the lower part of the abdominal aorta after it gives rise to the blood vessels supplying the kidneys. infra renal aneurysms can be generally treated with a stent graft which is implanted going through the artery in the groin. it is thus possible that a major surgery involving opening the abdomen can be avoided.
what is an infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm?
this an enlargement of the aorta. the normal aortic diameter in this location is 1. 8-2. 0 cm in size. an aneurysm is typically defined as an enlargement of aorta to double the normal size. the larger the aorta gets the thinner the wall and more likely the risk of rupture.
what is an infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm?
an infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm is the dilitation or ballooning of the abdominal aorta below the branches that provide blood to the kidneys. it is believed that the wall of the artery weakens over time from inflammation. this weakening causes the artery to swell. when > 5cm in diameter the risk of rupture and bleeding goes up dramatically. this is life threatening and is typically repaired.
what are signs and symptoms of an abdominal aortic aneurysm?
aaas are typically silent- no signs or symptoms until it starts to rupture. if you are thin and have a large aneurysm you may see it pulsating above the belly button. if you are male >65yrs and have ever smoked an ultrasound can diagnose it. if you are female a family history age >65 and having ever smoked are the criteria for a screening ultrasound.
what are signs and symptoms of an abdominal aortic aneurysm?
in abdomen. usually no pain unless getting ready to rupture. may embolize small clots to toe which cause small blue spots - blue toe syndrome.
what is the difference between aortic aneurysm and a regular aorta?
when a weak area of the abdominal aorta expands or bulges it is called an abdominal aortic aneurysm (aaa). the pressure from blood flowing through your abdominal aorta can cause a weakened part to bulge much like a balloon. a normal aorta is about 1 inch in diameter. however an aaa can stretch the aorta beyond its safety margin as it expands. aaa are a risk because of rupture (usually 5-5. 5 cm).
what is an abdominal aortic aneurysm?
ballooning of the abdominal portion of the aorta. the aorta is one of the major arteries that carry blood from your heart to the rest of the body. sometimes patients with high blood pressure cholesterol plaque formation can have weakened wall of this big artery causing it to bulge ( balloon out) like when one blow air into a balloon; if ruptured instant death can occur.
what is an abdominal aortic aneurysm?
an aneurysm of any artery is traditionally thought of an enlargement of the size of the artery to two times the normal size. this occurs primarily as a degernative process as the infrarenal aorta has no intramural arteries to repair itself. expansion occurs at 0. 5-0. 8 cm a year. aaa have to be followed serially. stable aaa of the infrarenal aorta should be repaired at 5. 5 cm.

what are the largest abdominal aortic aneurysm on record?
the largest abdominal aneurysm i have operated on was 16 cm in diameter. it is unusual these days to find really large diameter aneuryms due to better screening & due to the number found incidentally when exams such as sonograms or ct scans are performed for other reasons. increasing size correlates with increased rupture rates.
what are the largest abdominal aortic aneurysm on record?
the natural history of aaa is that they enlarge and rupture. the larger the greater the risk of rupture. i have seen a patient with an unruptured aaa that was 10 cm in diameter. he was repaired urgently! hard to imagine that aaa can get too much bigger and not leak or rupture.
what is the nursing care for abdominal aortic aneurysm?
the most critical part of nursing after a aaa repair is the immediate post-operative period- especially if the repair is done in an open fashion. there are dramatic fluid shifts that occur and close monitoring of acid-base status blood pressure blood counts and breathing are critical. once the breathing tube is out and the patients starts to eat the focus becomes pain control and slow rehab.
what is the nursing care for abdominal aortic aneurysm?
endograft patients need wound care at incision sites at groin.
what is the nursing care for abdominal aortic aneurysm?
there is no nursing care needed before repair and the care after repair would be no different than any moderate sized procedure. if the aneurysm is fixed with an endovascular technique very little post procedure care is needed.
which conditions render a person ineligible for enhanced external counter pulsation?
frequent arrhythmias active blood clot or poor circulation in the legs pregnancy large or symptomatic abdominal aortic aneurysm. the following need control prior to initiation: bp>180/120 hr >120 decompensated congrestive heart failure. age diabetes pacemakers/icds and obesity are not an issue.
what are the risks of operating on a anerisium in the belly? they told me it is''4'' with plaque?
if we are talking about surgical intervention for an abdominal aortic aneurysm then the risks of surgery to repair the aneurysm are as follows: risk of rupture during the procedure infection blood loss pneumonia heart attack stroke reaction to anesthesia death from any of the above it is also important to note that the risks increase with age and the presence of other medical conditions(heart disease lung disease diabetes) depending on the type of surgery(open or endovascular) that will be done the risks could vary. please make sure that the surgeon explains to you all the risks involved and any other questions you have about the procedure. good luck.

if the wall of the aneurysm is calcified it may be possible to see it on a regular abdominal x-ray especially if a transtable view is obtained.
would a routine regular abdominal x-ray be able to detect an abdominal aortic aneurysm?
ultrasound is a superior test for detecting abdominal aortic aneurysms. it is non-invasive and does not require ionizing radiation (it uses sound waves). if you're a smoker have copd high blood pressure or a have a family member with an aneurysm ask if you should be screened. abdominal x-ray is not a good test for detecting aneurysms- it relies on detecting calcium and misses many!
would a routine regular abdominal x-ray be able to detect an abdominal aortic aneurysm?
if there is enough calcium in the wall of the aneurysm it may be able to be seen on plain x-ray. the best screening method for an aneurysm of the abdominal aorta is an ultrasound. this is non invasive and easy to do.

having an aneurysm will not necessarily give you any pain. symptoms may or may not occur even with large aneurysms. on many patients symptoms occur when expanding or when rupture occurs. unfortunately about 17 000 americans die from aneurysm rupture /yr. sudden flank pain usually on the left abdominal distention low back pain with or without passing out hypotension collapse. must diagnose early.
what kind of stomach pain does a person get if he has an abdominal aortic aneurysm?
when you have an aneurysm of the abdominal aorta any type of abdominal pain is significant and should not be taken lightly. at that point the only way to identify the cause of the pain is to have a ct scan. this is very serious and should be evaluated emergency in the emergency room.
would a regular abdominal xray be able to see an abdominal aortic aneurysm?
plain x-rays use ionizing radiation and can miss many aneurysms - only images the ones that have a lot of calcium in them (many don't have calcium at all). ultrasound uses sound waves and sees just about every aneurysm so it's the very best screening test!
would a regular abdominal xray be able to see an abdominal aortic aneurysm?
an abdominal x ray doesn't show blood vessels so it's not used to detect aneurysms. an abdominal ultrasound is usually done to screen for aortic aneurysms. men who have ever smoked are advised to have an abdominal ultrasound between the ages of 65 and 75.
