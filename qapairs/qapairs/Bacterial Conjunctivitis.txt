whats the diffrence between patanol and zaditor (ketotifen)? my 4yrold son has problems with eyes matting shut and his dr said allergies. what can i do or buy
regarding patanol vs. zaditor (ketotifen) look at: <link> under the care of an ophthalmologist steroid drops may be effective though an ophthalmologist should verify the diagnosis in a toddler since a "shield ulcer" can interfere with visual function. another consideration is a low-grade bacterial conjunctivitis so visit an ophthalmologist trusted by your pediatrician.
