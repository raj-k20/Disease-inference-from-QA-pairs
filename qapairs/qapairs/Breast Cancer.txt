if they are doing fat transfer to the breasts why do people still get breast implants?
enlargement has not been proven to be safe long term. for reconstruction or for other contour deformities or in other areas of the body fat grafting is excellent but has limitations. for example about half to 2/3 of transferred fat dies leaving scars and/or calcifications which could delay or misdiagnose breast cancer. implants are still the best safest and proven ways to enlarge breasts!
if they are doing fat transfer to the breasts why do people still get breast implants?
the reasons that people choose implants vs fat grafting are - 1) calcification and scarring issues within the breast parenchyma following fat grafting can possibly cause delay in diagnosis of breast cancer. 2) augmentation size limitation with fat grafting. 3)implants provide consistency in size ; shape that does not impair visualization of the breast parenchyma as implants are below the breasts.
i'm 23 years old n i want a fat transfer sergery i have big breast could they use that fat for other body parts?
it's not a good idea to use breast tissue to transfer to other areas of the body for several reasons. especially in young women the breast is actually made up of mostly glandular tissue with less fat. these cells make milk so cannot be transferred. additionally with breast cancer risk transfer of breast tissue would be a bad idea-if these cells later develop cancer it may be hard to diagnose/tx.

having a family history of breast cancer previous biopsy showing atypical hyperplasia and having dense breast tissue all increase risk. older age at first childbirth and not breastfeeding increase risk. in addition being overweight not exercising having a high alcohol intake and a high-fat diet also all increase risk.
what could increase risk of breast cancer?
lots+ a family history-mother and/or father's side early onset of period dense breasts alcohol use/excess hormone use esp. postmenopausal hx of the "known' genes brca 1/brca 2 in you or your family in some breast ca triple neg "group" high fertility rate esp later in life late menopause =55+ nipple disch sx esp oneside 1st preg after 30 obesity ? typeii dm pers. hx of breast bx more++.
what could increase risk of breast cancer?
another factor and brca-1&2 are heritable risks that can be detected. the other answers are correct.
why is having fewer pregnancies or fewer kids a risk factor for cancer of the breast?
prolonged exposure to and higher concentrations of estrogen increases the risk of breast cancer. the more pregnancies the fewer menses. breast feeding accomplishes the same goal. also age at 1st birth is associated with bc risk too. check this out from acs: <link>
why is having fewer pregnancies or fewer kids a risk factor for cancer of the breast?
pregnancy is protective against cancer because there is a natural change in hormone fluctuations. the estrogen produced in pregnancy estriol is very protective against breast cancer. however this occurs only if the pregnancy occurs before 30 not after. breast feeding stops the hormones which can also be protective; so its age how often pregnant and breast feeding that are the factors to see.
what causes boob cancer? i've heard it's the pill but what about chest x-rays or other chemicals?
almost certainly not the pill. one theory that i like links the increase in breast cancer to pesticides that were used so much in the 50's and 60's. chemically many of these pesticides resemble estrogen. it is notable that puberty is occuring at younger ages in the us. hormones in food is another interesting theory. a regular chest xray probably ok - frequent exposure definitely not ok.
why is breast cancer awareness more common than other common cancers?
breast cancer is the most common cancer in women. additionally there has been a huge push from several national organizations as well as women's groups to increase awareness and to increase mammography usage.
why is breast cancer awareness more common than other common cancers?
breast cancer is a very common cancer in the united states. at the same time the cure rates for early stage disease are quite high. thus there are many breast cancer survivors who work to promote awareness. these survivors often help other cancer patients as well.
what is meant by having estrogen receptor positive breast cancer?
most breast cancers are estrogen receptor positive. the cancer cells have receptors that fit the estrogen molecule that a body produces. think: a lock and key - when estrogen binds to the receptor the tumor cell is stimulated to grow and divide. er+ tumors can be blocked by tamoxifen and arimidex (anastrozole) (and others) that interfere with this pathway.
what is meant by having estrogen receptor positive breast cancer?
estrogen receptors are small proteins found on the surface of some cancer cells. a positive result means the proteins are present a negative result means they are not present.
what is meant by having estrogen receptor positive breast cancer?
er positive breast cancer means that the cancer expresses estrogen receptors. this is beneficial because we can hormonally manipulate this type of cancer with drugs like tamoxifen and arimidex (anastrozole) which are antiestrogens.
what are the tests for metastatic breast cancer?
the primary test for staging for breast cancer is the pet/ct scan. a bone scan is also helpful if you're concerned about bony disease and a head mri for brain metastases. the sites of distant spread for breast cancer are generally the lungs the liver the bone and the brain so these tests are sufficient.
what are the tests for metastatic breast cancer?
the primary test for staging for breast cancer is the pet/ct scan. a bone scan is also a helpful test if you're concerned about bony disease and a brain mri is helpful to look at the head. the sites of distant spread of breast cancer are generally liver lungs bone and brain so these tests are sufficient.
what are the tests for metastatic breast cancer?
mri pet scan bone scan x-rays blood chemistry etc.
what is the incidence of breast cancer among women of child bearing age?
while the lifetime risk of breast cancer in the us is ~12% the incidence in women of childbearing years is much lower: from age 20-29 the incidence is ~1 in 1400; from age 30-39 1 in 233; from age 40-49 1 in 69.
what is the incidence of breast cancer among women of child bearing age?
a woman has a life time risk of about 13% of getting breast cancer. the incidence increases with increasing age peaking at 75-80 years. the average age at diagnosis is 61 lower for african american and hispanic women.
what is the incidence of breast cancer among women of child bearing age?
breast cancer is rare but still possible to have breast cancer woman in child bearing age. ' seer ' data 2002 to 2006 of total % of incidence breast cancers age 20 to 30 years occurance of 1. 9 % age 35 to 44 10. 5%. in 2012 total breast cancer patients 222870 females and 2190 men in usa.
who is at risk for lymphedema?
anything that disrupts the lymphatic microcirculation of an extremity can cause lymphedema. the most common cause is the surgical removal of lymph nodes (ln) to stage certain cancers (breast and melanoma most commonly). breast cancer treatment often includes radiation therapy; if the lns are included in the radiation field the risks increase. thankfully rates are down due to new techniques.
who is at risk for lymphedema?
lymphedema is caused by poor lymphatic circulation. the most common cause is the removal of lymph nodes with breast cancer surgery. obesity is a common cause of lymphedema. anybody who has an infection surgery or trauma to a limb is at risk for lymphedema.
what is the difference between a screening mammogram a diagnostic mammogram and an ultrasound?
mammogram is a study of both breasts that is performed on asymptomatic women to try and detect signs of breast cancer. a diagnostic mammogram consists of special views and is usually targeted to a specific area of the breast to further evaluate a potential abnormality seen on screening mammo or felt on clinical exam.
what are some benefits of getting a mammogram?
early detection in breast cancer saves lives. the purpose of a screening test is it identify cancer early when its treatable.
what are some benefits of getting a mammogram?
the early detection of breast cancer when it is potentially most curable is the benefit of screening mammography. evaluation of a lump or other symptom is the benefit of diagnostic mammography.
what are some benefits of getting a mammogram?
mammogram are used for the early detection of breast cancer.
who is more likely at risk for lymphedema?
one answer is if you've had lymph nodes removed (e. g. along with breast cancer surgery) or destroyed (e. g. radiation therapy) you may be at risk.
who is more likely at risk for lymphedema?
as dr. pappachen said cancer and treatment can cause lymphedema. this would be secondary lymphedema because something else caused it. it is seen most commonly in cases of breast cancer and women would be most affected. for primary lymphedema where the cause is not identifiable it is most commonly begins in women under the age of 35. primary is much less common than secondary though.
where the breast cancer originate?
ductal carcinoma in situ and invasive ducal carcinoma originate within the ducts of the breast. lobular carcinoma in situ and invasive lobular carcinoma originate in the lobules or milk glands.
where the breast cancer originate?
breast cancer starts in the ducts of the breast.
where the breast cancer originate?
most breast cancers originate within the ducts that transport the breast milk or the lobules that produce the milk. the cancer cells may then break out of the ducts and lobules and enter into the supportive tissue that makes up most of the breast. within this supportive tissue are the lymphatics and blood vessels into which these cells may enter and travel throughout the body.
where the breast cancer originate?
majority of breast cancers are derived from the epithelium lining of the ducts or lobules- thus called ductal carcinoma of lobular carcinoma. rarely cancer also can originate from the supportive tissue in between ducts and lobules. also although rare lymphoma such as anaplastic large clel lymphoma or others-t cell lymphoma etc- or toher cancer like small cell ca can happen in breast.
what are the causes of breast cancer?
unfortunately we don't know enough about breast cancer to be able to identify the specific causes; at best we know of some conditions that are associated with breast cancer such as high and/or prolonged unopposed estrogen levels (early menarche late menopause hormone replacement). app. 10-15% of cases are due to hereditary risks the rest are environmental.
what are the causes of breast cancer?
the number one risk factor is being female. other risk factors are family history early menarche late menopause genetic predisposition unopposed estrogen therapy history of radiation to the chest wall and a personal history of breast cancer.
when would patients with invasive cancers be advised to have a mastectomy rather than a lumpectomy?
breast cancers sometimes arise from multiple different areas in the same breast called multicentric growth. in these cases mastectomy is necessary. a second reason is if a woman has the brca mutation in which case her risk of a second breast cancer down the road is so high that she may opt for bilateral mastectomy.
when would patients with invasive cancers be advised to have a mastectomy rather than a lumpectomy?
women who opt for lumpectomy for breast cancer treatment must then have radiation therapy. there are certain connective tissue diseases such as scleroderma that prevent one from having rt. furthermore when diagnosed during pregnancy it is usually advisable to avoid rt.
why can arm swelling and pain happen after breast cancer surgery?
an essential part of breast cancer staging is the removal of some of the lymph nodes under the armpit. the lymphatic system's job includes draining tissue fluid and bringing it back into the circulation. lymph node removal short-circuits this process leading to the risk of chronic swelling or lymphedema. the less nodes removed the lower the risk.
why can arm swelling and pain happen after breast cancer surgery?
when lymph nodes are removed from under the arm during breast cancer surgery you are at risk for developing lymphedema (swelling). the amount of lymphedema varies and can depend on the number of lymph nodes removed. lymphedema can be treated and controlled. i recommend you ask your surgeon to refer you to a lymphedema clinic for evaluation.
why can arm swelling and pain happen after breast cancer surgery?
usually breast cancer surgery associate with lymph harvesting. depending on how extensive the lymph node dissection is you may experience pain and swelling of the arm and shoulder with extensive lymph node dissection.
where can women with breast cancer find support?
there are many places to seek! several internet support groups are out there. you should also check with your oncologist surgeon or radiation oncologists. several doctor's office offer support groups for their patients.
where can women with breast cancer find support?
i suggest you start by calling the above number which is sponsored by the national cancer institute; they should be able to give you a list of local support groups. in addition i recommend that you call your local hospital as most have support groups that regularly meet at the hospital. good luck!
what is the most effective breast imaging method? i have had breast cancer in the past. what is the most reliable imaging method for follow up check ups? i'm concerned that something might show up in one type of test but not another.
a diagnostic mammogram is generally the recommended imaging modality for follow-up in a patient with prior breast cancer. no screening exam is perfect when it comes to detecting recurrent breast cancer but mammography is generally considered the most sensitive test. eventually mri could replace mammography in this role but breast mri has multiple limitations which prevent it from being the screening exam of choice at this time. first it is extremely extensive and having a breast mri every 6 to 12 months is usually not economically feasible for the patient. second the technology is relatively new and most breast imagers are more familiar with and effective at using mammography for screening. breast ultrasound is not an adequate screening when compared with mammography but it can be used when additional imaging is needed.
what is the most effective breast imaging method? i have had breast cancer in the past. what is the most reliable imaging method for follow up check ups? i'm concerned that something might show up in one type of test but not another.
mammography is still the gold standard for breast cancer screening.
what is the most effective breast imaging method? i have had breast cancer in the past. what is the most reliable imaging method for follow up check ups? i'm concerned that something might show up in one type of test but not another.
if you had a lumpectomy you should get followup breast imaging. mammography and a breast exam should be included. whether ultrasound or mri would be helpful needs to be discussed with your doctor and depends on a number of factors including how your prior tumor was found breast density etc.
central obesity. does it give high ldl and tg?
central or visceral adiposity is a risk factor for abnormal cholesterol and high triglycerides high ldl and low hdl these fat cell leak out fatty acids that created lipid abnormalities. these fat cells secreted many inflammatory hormones that increase liver problems increase risk for diabetes heart disease and gout. this fat also increases risk of cancers such as colon and breast cancer.
can diet help prevent cancer?
dietary changes (increased fruits & vegetables increased lean meats less red meats less fat reduced alcohol use) can help reduce the incidence of cancers. colon cancer stomach cancer breast cancer are some examples where the rates of new and recurrent cancers are affected by diet changes.
how exactly does bariatric surgery lower the risk of getting cancer?
morbid obesity is the second most common preventable cause of cancer. obesity significantly increases the risk of cancer death of many cancers. the mechanism is related to the inflammatory hormones and chemicals that are found in morbidly obese patients. now when we manage a very heavy patient with node-positive breast cancer we suggest weight loss surgery shortly after the chemo and radiation.
could you prevent breast and colon cancer while on orlistat?
in theory the blocked fat absorption and oily stools will decrease colon exposure to environmental toxins by hurrying waste through the system (the unpleasant side effect of ally) but other toxins are still present plus the genetic component plus other environmental effects (eg. smoking) so doubtful it will help! can't even guess about breast cancer though.
can you get breast augmentation with fat instead of silicone?
for sure this is being performed. there are some issues with injecting fat into the breast area especially if you have a family history of breast cancer. best to speak with your plastic surgeons about this.
how does being overweight compromise the immune system for instance whe it comes to breast cancer reoccurence?
about 80% of breast cancers are estrogen receptor positive ie they are stimulated to grow by estrogen in your body. after menopause when the ovaries stop producing estrogen the levels fall significantly but not to zero. low levels of estrogen are made in fat tissue and if this is a larger amount this can be relevant in increasing the chance of the cancer recurring.
how does being overweight compromise the immune system for instance whe it comes to breast cancer reoccurence?
this is unclear but we do know that being obese increases your risk of developing several different types of cancer. maintaining a healthy weight will reduce this risks.
cancer of the breast is a universal thing or related to western diet and lifestyle?
the short answer is we don't really know. we do know that obesity is related to an increased risk of some breast cancers we also know that exerise helps decrease the risk and potential recurrence. but unfortunately not much is being done to investigate environmental pollutants; like industrial wastes radiation emf food additives etc. only 15% of breast cancer donations is spent in find causes.
cancer of the breast is a universal thing or related to western diet and lifestyle?
breast cancer is definitely greater in western countries but so is obesity and high fat diets. no one is immune to cancer even with a healthy lifestyle but you decrease the probability of it. the us has 70% of the population with a weight problem. being overweight increases your risk of every cancer as well as heart disease. eat more plants keep a healthy weight don't smoke or use alcohol.
cancer of the breast is a universal thing or related to western diet and lifestyle?
while breast cancer is unfortunately a very common problems- worldwide as well as in us the incidence is increased by some risk factors incluiding- obesity sedentary lifestyle alcohol tobacco red meat/dietary habit previous radiation to the chest area hormone use genetic mutation/ factors delayed pregnancy etc. yes i think is related to dietary habit at some degree.
cancer of the breast is a universal thing or related to western diet and lifestyle?
breast cancer is collection of different cancers arising in the breast. it is clearly associated with lifestyle factors in many cases but not all. a sedentary lifestyle delayed child bearing not breast-feeding obesity alcohol and even smoking (a smaller risk here) are all traits of developed countries. rates of bc track very closely to urbanization and development.
cancer of the breast is a universal thing or related to western diet and lifestyle?
breast cancer occur in all ethnic group. dietary play very little if any.
when do you get regular mammograms? breast cancer does not run in my family but i want to make sure i'm doing everything to stay in good health. at what age do you recommend women start getting mammograms?
currently at our institution we recommend that a woman with no risk factors begin yearly screening mammography at age 40. however the recommendation for beginning screening mammography has become more controversial due to the recently published recommendations by the us preventative services task force which recommends screening mammography for women age 50 to 74 years. a rationale behind this recommendation is that screening mammography in women age 40 - 49 years results in more false positive results with comparatively few cancers detected. currently both the american college of radiology and the american cancer society recommend yearly screening beginning at 40 years of age.
when do you get regular mammograms? breast cancer does not run in my family but i want to make sure i'm doing everything to stay in good health. at what age do you recommend women start getting mammograms?
you should start getting annual mammograms at age 40.
when do you get regular mammograms? breast cancer does not run in my family but i want to make sure i'm doing everything to stay in good health. at what age do you recommend women start getting mammograms?
for my patients i recommend a yearly mammogram starting at age 40.
what is male breast cancer? how common is breast cancer in males? are there any differences between breast cancer in males and females?
breast is rare but does happen. it is usually detected by the development of a lump behind the nipple. when compared between men and women they do the same based on the stage of the cancer.
what is male breast cancer? how common is breast cancer in males? are there any differences between breast cancer in males and females?
male breast cancer is quite rare. presents as a painless lump under the nipple most often over age 65. less than 1% of breast cancers occur in men. otherwise mastectomy and chemotherapy is commonly indicated. cell type can be similar to female breast cancer.
what is male breast cancer? how common is breast cancer in males? are there any differences between breast cancer in males and females?
breast cancer in males is much less common than in females and makes up less than 1% of all cases of breast cancer. the estimated number of new cases of male breast cancer in the united states in 2010 is 1 970 compared to 207 090 new cases of female breast cancer. the most typical age for breast cancer to be diagnosed in a male is between 60 and 70 years old. some risk factors increase the chance of getting breast cancer. previous exposure to radiation or having female relatives with breast cancer is a similar risk for males and females. having a disease that leads to high levels of estrogen is also a risk for both males and females but while women may more commonly experience this risk by taking medication that contains estrogen men usually have increased estrogen if they have a disease such as cirrhosis or an unusual disorder called klinefelter syndrome. etiology prognosis and treatment are similar in men and women.
what side effects can i expect from breast implants? what are some of the most common side effects involved with breast implants? is there any correlation between breast cancer and implants?
the major side affect of implants is capsular contracture. you need to discuss this with a board certified plastic surgeons.
what side effects can i expect from breast implants? what are some of the most common side effects involved with breast implants? is there any correlation between breast cancer and implants?
breast implants do not cause or prevent breast cancer. the material used in breast implants in the us do not get absorbed by the body. the reaction comes from potential risk of infection like any foreign body such as artificial hip or pacemaker and scarring known as capsular contracture. if you go to an untrained surgeon you will have other problems caused by technical errors size errors etc.
what side effects can i expect from breast implants? what are some of the most common side effects involved with breast implants? is there any correlation between breast cancer and implants?
there has been much made about the risk of breast cancer and implants and for the most part there is no association with breast cancer delay in diagnosis or worse prognosis for women with implants. there is a very rare form of cancer alcl that has been associated with the capsule the body forms around the implant but this is in about 3 out of a million patients. overall they are safe.
what side effects can i expect from breast implants? what are some of the most common side effects involved with breast implants? is there any correlation between breast cancer and implants?
breast implants are generally well tolerated with few side effects. one of the most common long term side effect is called a capsular contracture where the tissue around the implant thickens and can become painful and distorted. breast implants are not known to cause an increase in your chance for breast cancer.
what side effects can i expect from breast implants? what are some of the most common side effects involved with breast implants? is there any correlation between breast cancer and implants?
breast implants both saline and silicone have been shown to be safe and not associated with breast cancer. although there are many rare complication that can occure with breast implants: shifting sagging rippling firmness nipple areola change in sensativity these (and other) side effects are generally of minimal magnide or they are temporary or reversable. to the extend that some of these issue can persist more than 95% of breast augmenation patients are happy about their decision to have the surgery. gregory laurence md.
what are the chances that this is breast cancer? i am young but have a very full family history of cancer on both sides of my family skin cancer breast cancer lung cancer ovarian cancer the list continues recently i noticed a lump on my left breast and
hello it is difficult to answer this question specifically for you without being able to see the images. in general a radiologist a physician that looks at medical images will assess the shape size margins and density of a mass to determine the chance that it might be cancer. the radiologist may use mammograms and ultrasound images to gather this information. radiologists will recommend a biopsy for any abnormality that has a chance of being cancer that is 2% or more. "pointy edges" will raise the chance to greater than 2%. therefore i would follow the recommendation for biopsy. the chance that this particular finding is cancer also depends on your age personal history and family history. from your story i think that the most important factor is the family history. having breast and ovarian cancer in your family will raise your personal risk. the risk is highest if it was a first-degree relative (sister or mother) that had breast or ovarian cancer. if it was grandmother or distant cousin the risk for you is not as high. if it was mother or sister or both this might be a sign that your family has a gene that raises the risk of some kinds of cancer. if so i would recommend that you all talk to a medical provider that performs genetic counseling. this can help you decide if you want to make a special effort to reduce your risk or start special screening tests to help detect cancer early if it happens. i see that you posted this question 28 days ago. i see that the biopsy likely has already happened and that you have the result. i hope that it was benign. if not then i hope that you know that we have great treatments for breast cancer and most women are survivors. i will be thinking about you and hoping for the best.
what are the chances that this is breast cancer? i am young but have a very full family history of cancer on both sides of my family skin cancer breast cancer lung cancer ovarian cancer the list continues recently i noticed a lump on my left breast and
the next step once a lump in the breast is felt is proving that it is not cancer. this will require an examination by your doctor and possibly additional testing such as a mammogram or ultrasound. ultimately a biopsy my be necessary and referral to a breast surgery specialist. take the first step though.
what are the chances that this is breast cancer? i am young but have a very full family history of cancer on both sides of my family skin cancer breast cancer lung cancer ovarian cancer the list continues recently i noticed a lump on my left breast and
with your family history and your concerns i would see your friendly primary care doctor and have the lump examined. based on the physical findings your doctor may order imaging to further diagnose the lump.
what kind of impact does stress have on breast cancer?
no strong evidence that stress causes any cancer. however those who attempt to manage their stress with risky behaviors such as smoking or drinking alcohol- can increase the risk to have cancer related to their behavior. also from experimental studies- it's suggested that stress can affect a tumor’s ability to grow and spread. emotional and social support can help cope with psychological stress.
what kind of impact does stress have on breast cancer?
there is not clear evidence but decreasing your stress has to be good thing.
what kind of impact does stress have on breast cancer?
there is no link between stress and development of breast cancer. stress can adversely affect a womans' ability to undergo complex and lengthy breast cancer treatment- this in turn can lead to inferior results. patients without psychosocial support for stress can develop problems such as ptsd strained spousal relationships sexual problems etc.
what kind of impact does stress have on breast cancer?
very recently there was a study that identified stress as an independent cause of a type of breast cancer-called triple negativethis type is very aggressive even at a small size. it means that this type does not have hormone receptors for estrogen and progesterone also is negative for her2 receptors. this type accounts for about 15% of all breast cancer. we don't have targeted tx yet.
what are margins in relation to breast cancer?
when a cancer is removed the pathologist will measure the distance between the edge of the cancer and the surrounding normal breast tissue - this is the margin. clear margins imply that all of the cancer was removed but this does not mean it cannot come back. there is not always agreement on how large of a margin is necessary and sometimes it depends on the type of cancer.
what are margins in relation to breast cancer?
breast conserving treatment requires the complete removal of the cancer by lumpectomy followed by radiation therapy. the pathologist measures the success of lumpectomy by carefully looking at the outer edges of the lumpectomy to be sure no cancer went right to the edge; if it did ("positive margin") we need to reoperate to remove more breast tissue.
what are margins in relation to breast cancer?
this refers to the amount of normal tissue surrounding the breast cancer that is removed surgically. a positive margin means that all of the tumor was not removed.
what are risk factors for breast cancer?
brca gene mutation family history esp. a first-degree relative (mother father or sister) early age at first period late menopause no children or children after age 30 obesity high-fat diet. however it is very important to realize that there is no guaranteed method of prevention and 75% of newly diagnosed breast cancer patients have no family history of breast cancer - everyone is at risk.
what are risk factors for breast cancer?
1 in 8 women in the us will develop breast cancer in their lifetime. this is a disease that spares no one. certainly people with a strong family history or high estrogen levels (early puberty late menopause etc. ) may have an increased risk but this is overemphasized. bottom line: we have a simple inexpensive test that can find breast ca early that remains underutilized. mammograms save lives.
what are risk factors for breast cancer?
family history obesity increased alcohol intake sedentary lifestyle taking unopposed estrogen .
what are the long-term effects of breast cancer?
many women with breast cancer have their disease limited to the breast treatment of which will have no long-term effects. some women will have disease outside the breast which requires chemotherapy which carries some risks to other organs. a percentage of these women with systemic disease will succumb to the ca if it takes over a vital organ.
what are the long-term effects of breast cancer?
depends to the stage of the disease the type of treatment received and the body's response to the treatment. in most cases after completion of treatment there is no or little long term effects. if there is metastatic disease there will be many different adverse effects based on the organ involved. if a mastectomy is done there will be loss of the breast. as you can see there is no one answer.
what are the risks with herceptin (trastuzumab) therapy?
herceptin (trastuzumab) is an imp drug for breast cancer therapy. it can cause infusion reaction affect blood counts mild nausea most important risk is a decline in heart function called cardiomyopathy. this is rare though about 5-6% risk and usually is reversible but cardiac function will need to be monitored during herceptin (trastuzumab) therapy by serial ultrasounds (or echocardiograms).
what are the symptoms of breast cancer?
while some women will feel a new lump or a new mass that has appeared in their breast. the majority of women have no symptoms and the cancer is detected by imaging only. it is very important to follow your doctor's recommendations regarding mammogram frequency. early detection = better chance for a cure!
what are the symptoms of breast cancer?
the most common symptom is the presence of a lump in the breast. other symptoms include nipple discharge nipple inversion skin indentation and breast pain. nevertheless the majority of people diagnosed with breast cancer have no symptoms whatsoever.
what breast cancer symptoms and warning signs?
many times- there is no symptom and breast cancer is diagosed through the abnormal mammogram. symptom/sign can be presented with palpable lump on the breast bloody nipple discharge skin eruption around the nipple that does not go away and itch skin thickness over the breast area. frequently- lump/s can also present on the arm pit area. any of these- please see your doctor immediately.
what breast cancer symptoms and warning signs?
the most common symptom of breast cancer is no symptoms at all. it is important to perform your screening mammography as prescribed by your physician. the best chance for a cure happens when breast cancer is detected at the earliest stages.
what breast cancer symptoms and warning signs?
a new breast lump is the most common ca symptom and warrants physician evaluation. less common symptoms include nipple discharge (especially clear or bloody spontaneous and from one nipple duct) skin dimpling/indentation breast pain and rarely breast swelling and redness with or without a rash.
what food should people with breast cancer avoid?
eating a well balanced meal and maintaining a healthy weight is very important. it is also important to tell your oncologist or radiation oncologist which supplements you are taking because these can interfere negatively with your treatment.
what food should people with breast cancer avoid?
the best "diet" for breast cancer is what is recommended for everyone. avoid refined sugars (processed foods) eat whole grain foods lots of fruits and vegetables and limit alcohol. women should average one or less per day and men 2 or less.
what is brac analysis for breast cancer?
as many as 10-15% of breast cancers in the us are believed to be hereditary. these are linked to mutations of a particular group of genes called the brca genes. there is a simple blood test to check to see if someone has a brca mutation. i advise my interested patients to see a genetic counselor to fully understand the ramifications of this test before having it done.
what is brac analysis for breast cancer?
actually the genetic sample can now be obtained through a mouth rinse without the need to draw blood. yes one should understand the repercussions of positive and negative results and know what they might choose to do in either case before testing is sent. also ideally testing should start with an affected individual first (if one is willing and available).
what is brac analysis for breast cancer?
brca testing screens women who are at high risk for hereditary breast cancer. having mutations in these genes increases your risk of breast cancer dramatically. patients that are positive for the mutation are advised to undergo prophylactic mastectomies and to have both of their ovaries removed after their families are complete.
what muscle is removed during a radical mastectomy?
actually this question should read "was" not "is" since we never perform radical mastectomies any more (nor have we for 30+ yrs); removing the muscles never helps treat the cancer. the most common mastectomy for breast cancer treatment is called a modified radical mastectomy. this means that the breast and armpit lymph nodes are removed without any muscle removal.
what type of breast cancer do i have?
although the two most common types of invasive breast cancer are "ductal" and "lobular" there are many less common varieties. however the most important features are not necessarily the type of breast cancer but the size lymph node status presence/absence of metastatic disease and hormonal/her-2 status of the tumor.
what type of breast cancer do i have?
breast cancer is divided into different categories depending on different criteria. a typical description at least should include-the histolopathological type the grade the stage of the tumor and the expression of proteins and genes. you should have an access of those information and have further detail discussion with your oncologist as this will impact on your treatment options prognosis etc.
what are the survival rates for the various types of breast cancer surgeries? does the type of surgery affect whether the cancer will reappear?
the survival rates for breast conservation and mastectomy are the same. there is a slightly higher rate of local recurrence for breast conservation (with radiation it should be <1% per year out to 10 years) but this does not impact survival which is the most important consideration of any cancer treatment.
what are the survival rates for the various types of breast cancer surgeries? does the type of surgery affect whether the cancer will reappear?
it is well-established that the survival rate for breast cancer is the same whether a mastectomy or lumpectomy is performed. however breast cancer can "come back" in the treated breast more commonly following lumpectomy. this is why radiation therapy is necessary after lumpectomy which will bring the local recurrence rate down below 5%.
where can i find out about clinical trials for breast cancer?
searching on the web clinicaltrials. gov is a good source.
where can i find out about clinical trials for breast cancer?
you can search for clinical trials on the national cancer institute website at <link> cancer. gov/clinicaltrials/search or you should ask your health care provider which clinical trials would be open to you.
who is most at risk for breast cancer?
brca gene mutation family history esp. a first-degree relative (mother father or sister) early age at first period late menopause no children or children after age 30 obesity high-fat diet. however it is very important to realize that there is no guaranteed method of prevention and 75% of newly diagnosed breast cancer patients have no family history of breast cancer - everyone is at risk.
who is most at risk for breast cancer?
a woman in the us has a 1:8 lifetime risk of developing breast cancer so no one is immune. this risk increases with each passing decade and is higher amongst women with a strong family history. every woman in the us should begin to get yearly mammograms beginning at age 40: mammograms save lives.
who is most at risk for breast cancer?
those women mutations in either the brca1 or 2 genes. these patients have an 80% chance of developing breast cancer.
why are the lymph nodes in the armpit removed when a person undergoes surgery for breast cancer?
the first place that breast cancer will travel is to the lymph nodes in the armpit. a procedure called a sentinel lymph node biopsy removes the first draining lymph node from the breast. if this does not have cancer then we know that most lilkely the cancer has not spread.
why are the lymph nodes in the armpit removed when a person undergoes surgery for breast cancer?
the lymph nodes are small filters in the body where cancer cells may spread after breaking out of the organ where the cancer started. removing the lymph nodes gives us a "window into the rest of the body" to help us decide who may benefit from chemotherapy.
why are the lymph nodes in the armpit removed when a person undergoes surgery for breast cancer?
the lymph nodes in the axilla/armpit is usually one of the favorite locations of breast cancer to go to.
will you get breast cancer if you wear a bra to bed?
it is a myth that wearing a bra to bed wearing an underwire bra or wearing a bra that's too tight causes breast cancer. i wish it was that easy!
will you get breast cancer if you wear a bra to bed?
this was made up by a lone anti-brassiere crackpot in the 1990's. he's nuts. ignore this claim.
will you get breast cancer if you wear a bra to bed?
nope.
will you get breast cancer if you wear a bra to bed?
no scietific evidence.
what percentage of woman survive breast cancer?
according to the american cancer society 90% of all women with newly diagnosed breast cancer will be alive at 5 years. however individual survival depends on the cancer stage with more than 95% of localized breast cancer approximately 85% of regional breast cancer and only approximatley 25% of advanced breast cancer will be alive at 5 years.
what percentage of woman survive breast cancer?
this is a difficult question to answer. survival depends on stage aggressive of the tumor and any comorbitities that the patient may have. early detection leads to the best chance of a cure making yearly mammograms and clinical breast exams important.
why should i be concerned about breast cancer?
breast cancer will affect 1 in 9 women. the biggest risk factor for breast cancer is having breasts. although we hear alot about it most of us will not get breast cancer. your risk may be increased if you have a family history had an abnormal biopsy never have children or gain a large amount of weight as an adult. you do not need to be concerned but be aware of your own body.
why should i be concerned about breast cancer?
considering the lifetime risk of developing breast ca in the us is 1:8 how can you not be? it is a common misconception that people who have no family history are not at risk; in truth breast cancer is an environmental disease unrelated to heredity in almost 90% of cases. we have made few inroads in breast ca prevention but have learned that when you catch it early the cure rates are high.
what is a mammogram?
a mammogram is a special x-ray of the breast used to detect breast cancer.
what is a mammogram?
a mammogram is a type of breast xray which is intended to detect breast abnormalities including breast cancer. it is currently recommended as a screening study to be done once a year from age 40. it may have to be done as a diagnostic study based on your breast condition or the findings on a screening study. please check with your health care provider to see if you need to get a mammogram done.
will fibrocystic breast disease eventually or inevitably lead to breast cancer?
fibrocystic disease is now termed fibrocystic change and by itself is not associated with increased risk for breast cancer. however regular breast self examinations and mammograms are still recommended.
will fibrocystic breast disease eventually or inevitably lead to breast cancer?
the term fibrocystic "disease" is outdated and inaccurate. fibrocystic changes are very common (can be found in just about any women's breast tissue) are benign and do not increase breast cancer risk. increased breast density (a subjective mammographic finding) is associated with increased risk. findings of atypia along with fibrocystic changes on a biopsy are also a marker of increased risk.
will fibrocystic breast disease eventually or inevitably lead to breast cancer?
there is some evidence that "dense breasts" are at increased risk for developing breast cancer. breast cancer may be less detectable in breasts with fibrocystic changes. however the presence of fibrocystic change does not lead to breast cancer.
will fibrocystic breast disease eventually or inevitably lead to breast cancer?
fibrocystic breast disease will not eventually become breast cancer. besides the pain and discomfort associated with fibrocystic breasts cancer screening imaging is not as effective in these denser breasts and so careful and regular examination is wise.
will fibrocystic breast disease eventually or inevitably lead to breast cancer?
women with fibrocystic breast disease will not "inevitably" have breast cancer although fibrous breasts does make it more difficult to do self breast exams and may make it slightly more difficult to diagnosis breast cancer via mammograms. all the more reason to do monthly self breast exams and yearly mammograms in age-appropriate women.
what is inflammatory breast cancer (ibc)?
inflammatory breast cancer is a very aggressive and rare firm of breast cancer that is defined by invasion of the dermal lymphatic channels in ones skin. this presents as a red spreading rash on the skin and may or may not be associated with an actual mass in the breast. skin biopsy is used to diagnose it. aggressive tx includes chemotherapy mastectomy and radiation. reconstruction possible.
what is inflammatory breast cancer (ibc)?
ibc occurs suddenly with breast pain redness or swelling or a rash. mammograms are often negative because the tumor cells grow in a sheet and don't form a lump. it is very fast-growing and spreads quickly. immediate chemotherapy is needed. it looks like an infection so doctors often try antibiotics first delaying diagnosis. see a medical oncologist immediately if you have these symptoms.
what is inflammatory breast cancer (ibc)?
ibc is an aggressive type of breast cancer that grows very rapidly and invades the lymphatics of the skin of the breast giving the appearance of a breast infection; the breast is often red swollen tender with a rash. by definition cancer cells have gone 'elsewhere' at diagnosis; therefore chemotherapy is given first followed by mastectomy and then radiation therapy.
why does having an abortion so greatly increase the chance of getting breast cancer?
early retrospective studies suggested a link that has not been supported by more rigorous prospective studies. this is likely due to a retrospective bias where women with cancer were probably more likely to be truthful with their medical histories than unaffected people especially about as sensitive of a topic as abortion.
why does having an abortion so greatly increase the chance of getting breast cancer?
i give myself out to be pro-life and am embarrassed that this is still being put forward despite its being discredited scientifically. in some old studies women with breast cancer were told that the cause was often having had an abortion and they were urged to confess having undergone the procedure. you can see why this study got an association. the best recent work shows little or no effect.
why is breast cancer so deadly?
i do agree with dr. rosen that much progress has been made regarding breast cancer. but if undetected in the early stages it still can be deadly. 15% of the breast cancers are triple negative--neg for estrogen progesterone and her2 receptors we have targeted treatments for 85%. unfortunately triple negative- we don't know enough-many subtypes-no targeted tx. yet. this is more aggressive+/- deadly.
why is breast cancer so deadly?
when caught early the chance for cure is very high. this remains true for some advanced breast cancers as well. survival is dependent upon our ability to eradicate breast cancer cells that may have spread from the breast to vital organs (lungs liver bone etc). while chemotherapy isn't always effective we have made tremendous advances over the past decade and expect more to follow.
why is breast cancer so deadly?
dr. rosen is correct that if breast cancer is found small and early that it is generally highly treatable with a 98% treatment success rate. there are some breast cancers however that may have more aggressive cells hormone resistance or aggressive dna types. larger or neglected cancers are also more dangerous with risk of spreading to other locations or other organs.
what tests can be used to detect breast cancer?
the basis of breast cancer screening is trifold with breast self exam (bse) clinical breast exam (cbe) and annual screening mammography (mmg) at age 40 (still the standard recommendation). if any find a question then add diagnostic imaging including special mmg views and ultrasound. screening mri is for high risk pts (see acs criteria). final dx should usually be by image guided needle bx.
what tests can be used to detect breast cancer?
thermography is now being used more and more in the "alternative" field of medicine. it is more sensitive in finding and tracking temperature changes especially in dense tissue (higher the temperature activity higher cell activity). there is no risk of radiation as well. unfortunately insurances usually do not cover this service.
what tests can be used to detect breast cancer?
mammogram is typically the first study followed by an ultrasound. if there is any worrisome findings one will undergo image guided biopsy. in some instances mri maybe recommended.
what treatments are available for breast cancer?
local treatment involves surgery +/- radiation therapy (rt); chemotherapy is the mainstay for systemic rx (how we treat the whole body). breast cancer surgery requires either a lumpectomy or mastectomy along with (sentinel) lymph node biopsy. if a lumpectomy is performed radiation therapy is necessary. if a mastectomy is chosen (or required) reconstruction is almost always an option.
what treatments are available for breast cancer?
standard treatment is surgery followed by radiation &/or chemotherapy based on the type and degree of tumor. i believe such treatments are more successful with less side effects when combined with complementary approaches including diet nutritional supplements herbs & mind/body techniques. the book breast cancer: beyond convention edited by mary tagliaferri & isaac cohen is an excellent resource.
what are the side-effects of breast cancer treatment?
this is a complex question. each treatment-surgery radiation chemo hormonal- has it's own uniques set of side effects. in addition not everyone will experience side effects. the good news is that most side effects can be managed with treatment or medications. be sure to ask your oncology team questions.
what are the side-effects of breast cancer treatment?
breast cancer is treated with surgery radiation and chemotherapy. side effects of surgery are related to removal of lymph nodes. this can cause lymphedema but only in about 1/3 of patients. the chemotherapy can cause numbness aka neuropathy and the radiation can cause scarring of the skin. overall the side effects of therapy are considered mild compared to untreated cancer which can be fatal.
what are breast cancer treatments?
typically breast cancer is treated by a team of different cancer specialists. at first the surgeon performs breast surgery. later on medical drugs (hormone drugs and chemotherapy) and/ or radiotherapy may be used. other treatments include plastic surgery (for breast reconstruction) and physical therapy.
what are breast cancer treatments?
depending on the size status of nodes in the axilla and specialized testing done in the lab breast cancers are treated with surgery hormone and/or chemotherapy and radiation.
what are breast cancer treatments?
breast cancer is treated with surgery and/or radiation and/or chemotherapy / hormone therapy. the treatment types depends on the characteristics of the breast cancer.
what are the similarities and differences between tamoxifen and femara (letrozole)?
these are two drugs with different mechanisms of action. they are part of breast cancer treatment. tamoxifen blocks hormone receptors found on some breast cancers. femara (letrozole) blocks the production of hormones from the adrenal glands essentially acting as hormone receptors inhibitors. because of the way these drugs work femara (letrozole) can't be used in premenopausal women.
what are some of the symptoms of breast cancer?
the most common symptom of breast cancer is no symptoms at all. it is important to perform your screening mammography as prescribed by your physician. the best chance for a cure happens when breast cancer is detected at the earliest stages.
what are some of the symptoms of breast cancer?
the most common symptom is the presence of a new breast lump. other things to look for include nipple discharge especially clear or bloody breast pain and/or dimpling of the skin. of course the goal of breast cancer screening is to diagnose cancers before any of these symptoms develop. please begin yearly mammography at age 40.
when should i be worried about breast cancer?
women should be concerned about breast cancer. but with proper screening and early detection the best chances for a cure are achieved. meet with you doctor and discuss your risk and form a plan.
when should i be worried about breast cancer?
the incidence of breast cancer increases with age. while the lifetime risk of breast cancer is 1:8 a more meaningful statistic is the risk in any decade of life. for example us women have a 0. 4% chance of breast cancer in their 30's 1. 5% in their 40's 2. 4% in their 50's and 3. 5% in their 60's. unless you are in a high-risk group i suggest getting mammograms beginning at age 40.
what is the treatment for breast cancer?
the primary treatment for most breast cancers is surgery either mastectomy or lumpectomy; if one chooses lumpectomy they will also require radiation therapy. depending on the stage of the cancer chemotherapy may be indicated. this may be given as a pill and/or iv medication depending on tumor-specific factors.
what is the treatment for breast cancer?
breast cancer is treated with surgery radiation and/or chemotherapy / hormone therapy.
what do the stages of breast cancer mean?
stages depend on the size of the tumor and whether or not the cancer cells have traveled outside of the breast. you can find more detailed information here <link>
what do the stages of breast cancer mean?
we stage most cancers by gathering information about the cancer at the time of diagnosis to help predict prognosis and help choose therapies (ie worse prognosis = more aggressive therapy). most systems use t (tumor/size) n (nodal involvement) & m (? metastasis) to come up with a "stage". in breast cancer grade er and her2 status is considered and now genomic information (oncotype dx).
what do the stages of breast cancer mean?
breast cancer stage is predominantly based on cancer size and lymph node involvement. this can be correlated with survival rates (prognosis) which can then be used to guide therapy. that said i have never seen what a "50% survived" patient looks like. unless the chance is zero there should always be hope for cure with treatment.
what does stage 3 breast cancer mean?
stage 3 cancer means the breast cancer has extended to beyond the immediate region of the tumor and may have invaded nearby lymph nodes and muscles but has not spread to distant organs. although this stage is considered to be advanced there are a growing number of effective treatment options. this stage is divided into three groups: stage 3a stage 3b and stage 3c.
what does stage 3 breast cancer mean?
breast cancer survival is correlated with it's stage which is predominantly based on the cancer size it's growth and lymph node involvement. stage 3 means that the cancer has grown into the chest wall or skin and/or multiple lymph nodes (including areas outside the armpit) are involved. these are all signs that chemotherapy is needed for potential cure.
what are the benefits of screening early for breast cancer?
the earlier breast cancers are caught the more likely they can be cured. screening mammograms starting at age 40 can save 1 life for every 450-1000 mammograms done (depending on the study. ) screening detects breast cancer at an early stage.
what are the benefits of screening early for breast cancer?
early screening for breast cancer is not always recommended. it is most beneficial in high-risk cases (e. g. strong family history is present). here screening is recommended earlier than normal and about 5-10 years before the age at which relatives got their breast cancer.
what are the benefits of screening early for breast cancer?
screening leads to early detection. early detection leads to the best chance of a cure.
why is breast cancer more common in women than in men?
it is more common primarily because women have more estrogen and progesterone.
why is breast cancer more common in women than in men?
women have more breast tissue than men. in addition many cancers are driven by estrogen and progesterone the female hormones. the good thing is that it is one of most treatable female cancers when caught early.
what are the different stages of breast cancer?
here is a great website that explains. <link>
what are the different stages of breast cancer?
stage 0 is cancer confined to the ducts or lobules. stages 1 describes a small cancer without lymph node involvement. stage 2 is where the cancer is medium sized and/or involving lymph nodes. stage 3 is associated with cancers that are large involve the overlying skin or chest muscles or contiguous nodes. stage 4 describes distant organ involvement called metastases.
why don't men get breast cancer?
male breast cancer exists but is only 1% of breast ca. females develop breast tissue in response to hormones at levels that men don't achieve. if men take certain hormone medications their breast tissue can grow. breast cancer cells can be estrogen sensitive so genetic males taking estrogen or with liver dz may be at increased risk. brca gene can also increase risk as in females.
why don't men get breast cancer?
men do get breast cancer but their risk is considerably less than the risk in women. breast cancer is a disease of hormonally-active breast tissue; therefore with very little breast tissue their risks are much less.
why don't men get breast cancer?
although not as common men can develop breast cancer.
whom does breast cancer affect?
a common misconception is that women without a family history need not worry about breast cancer. in truth most breast cancers occur in women with no risk factors. furthermore the incidence increases with age. every woman needs to have regular screening mammograms beginning at age 40.
whom does breast cancer affect?
mostly women although about 1% of breast cancers occur in men.
when should you consider breast reconstruction?
i understand that receiving a breast cancer diagnosis is very difficult. that being said as soon as you speak to your breast cancer surgeon you should always inquire about the options for reconstruction even if you are having breast conserving surgery. you may consider to have a procedure to match your other breast to the affected side.
when should you consider breast reconstruction?
though hearing a breast cancer diagnosis is difficult and overwhelming it is important to know your options both for cancer treatment and reconstruction. that way you can make a good decision as to what to do.
when should you consider breast reconstruction?
psychological reaction secondary to grief reaction caused by loss of body part & best clinical results when 1st stage done concommitantly w mastectomy( plus saves 1 trip to or) if mastectomy is chosen bilateral mastectomy & reconstruction is always a good choice in my opinion because aesthetic results are better & there is some protection from future new breast cancers.
what are trastuzumab and herceptin?
herceptin/trastuzumab is an antibody to a cell surface proteint coded for by the her2neu gene. its present in some normal cells but in a subset of breast cancers (10-15%) there are multiple copies of the gene producing large amounts of the protein. the herceptin/trastuzumab antibody binds to that protein and reduces that aggressive nature of her2+cancer. it is usually given with chemo.
what are trastuzumab and herceptin?
herceptin (generic name trastuzumab) is a monoclonal antibody that binds to the her2 protein present on ~25% of pt's w/breast cancer effectively killing that cell. this is currently combined with other chemorx drugs for treating breast cancer. this protein is also present on some stomach cancers; herceptin is used for metastatic stomach cancer rx.
why might i need breast reconstruction surgery?
breast reconstruction is the rebuilding of a breast usually after surgery for breast cancer (mastectomy or lumpectomy) or surgery to prevent breast cancer ("prophylactic mastectomy"). non-cancer related reasons to need breast reconstruction include congenital breast absence (eg poland's syndrome) and to reconstruct after mastectomy performed for severe infection or tumors like phyllodes.
why might i need breast reconstruction surgery?
on rare occasions it is impossible to completely remove a breast cancer and close the skin. under these circumstances we often give chemotherapy first to shrink the cancer. if the cancer does not shrink it may be necessary to perform a reconstruction to cover the chest wall after removing the cancer.
who are the people at risk for breast cancer?
considering the fact that 1 in 8 us women will get breast ca in their lifetime no woman should think they are immune. certainly women with first-degree relatives with breast ca may be at increased risk. breast ca is also associated with women who have had elevated unopposed estrogen levels ie early menarche late menopause no prior children long history of birth control pills/hormone rep.
who are the people at risk for breast cancer?
women are at risk of developing breast cancer simply by being women. other factors such as family history hormone use nulliparity genetic predisposition also play a role in breast cancer risk.
what exactly is intraductal papilloma?
intraductal papilloma (ip) is the most common cause of bloody nipple discharge. it is a small mass within the duct of the breast. they are usually noncancerous but can sometimes have abnormal cells or an early breast cancer. once diagnosed on needle biopsy they are usually completely removed with surgery.
what are the odds of recovery from breast cancer?
this question is very complicated. recovery from breast cancer is related to the stage at diagnosis and the response to treatment. in general recovery is excellent when caught early and decreases with advancing stage.
what are the odds of recovery from breast cancer?
depends on tnm staging. larger tumors have more recurrences. spread to lymph nodes have a worse prognosis. metastases to liver bone et. have the worst prognosis. beyond that patients with estrogen receptor positive tumors do better. a woman with a mammographically detected er+ node negative breast cancer has a greater than 90% chance of beating the cancer.
what are the odds of recovery from breast cancer?
the odds depend on the patients general overall health and also the stage of the cancer.
what is invasive breast cancer and how is it treated? what is the general survival rate?
invasive refers to the tumor cells invading through the originating structure [usually the milk duct in breast cancer] and developing the ability to attract more blood supply and grow bigger. it also means it can spread to other parts of body. from am ca society: 2001-2002 stage & 5-year survival rate: 0-93%; i-88%; iia- 81%; iib- 74%; iiia- 67%; iiib- 41%*; iiic; 49%*; iv- 15%;.
what is invasive breast cancer and how is it treated? what is the general survival rate?
invasive cancer: malignant cells have penetrated into the surrouding cells and are at risk for metastases. in situ (dcis) is a condition where malignant appearing cells do not have that penetration - and have little or no risk of metastases. invasive breast cancer requires lumpectomy (with radiation) or mastectomy. most patients receive some sort of whole body treatment: chemo or hormonal block.
what does metastatic breast cancer really mean?
metastatic or stage 4 breast cancer means the cancer has spread into other places in the body. breast cancer at this stage can be treated sometimes for 10 or more years depending on the type but it cannot be cured.
what does metastatic breast cancer really mean?
it means that the cancer cells that started in the breast have traveled outside of the breast and have created new tumors in other locations.
what does metastatic breast cancer really mean?
breast cancer is cancer in the breast. when it goes somewhere else such as the lymph nodes or brain then it is metastatic. a biopsy can show that it is cancer and it originates from the breast and has spread somewhere else.
what does metastatic breast cancer really mean?
what makes any cancer "evil" is the potential for cancer cells to break away & travel thru the bloodstream or lymphatics & take up residence in a different organ. systemic disease implies that there are cancer cells "elsewhere" either indirectly identified by microscopic examination (+lymph node) or seen on x-ray studies (metastatic disease). rx requires meds that travel "elsewhere" ie chemo-rx.
what are some typical signs and symptoms of breast cancer?
common symptoms and signs include the presence of a lump nipple discharge nipple inversion and/or dimpling of the skin. while cancers typically do not cause pain a painful lump still must be considered a cancer until proven otherwise. rare forms of cancer may look like a breast infection (redness and swelling of the breast) or a scaly rash on the nipple.
what are some typical signs and symptoms of breast cancer?
while some women will feel a new lump or a new mass that has appeared in their breast. the majority of women have no symptoms and the cancer is detected by imaging only. it is very important to follow your doctor's recommendations regarding mammogram frequency. early detection = better chance for a cure!
will taking testosterone reduce my gynecomastia?
excess testosterone (t) is converted into estrogen which then exacerbates gynecomastia (male breasts). so taking t won't help you. instead check your estrogen level and block conversion of t into estrogen w/aromatase inhibitor such as anastrazole (prescription breast cancer drug). of course diet & exercise help too! less fat = less gyno. plastic surgeons can help when all else fails.
what is the best treatment for metastatic breast cancer? how about alternative treatments?
there is not a "best" treatment as metastatic breast cancers are different. the best treatment will take into account past treatment current symptoms and the subtype of breast cancer (er pr and her2 status) as well as the location of tumors. usually chemo or biologic therapy is necessary. alternative treatments like mushrooms may have anti-cancer effects but more studies are needed.
what is the best treatment for metastatic breast cancer? how about alternative treatments?
tastatic breast cancer there is no single best treatment. treatment depends on the type of disease age. spread of disease general health etc. alternative treatments are not primary treatment methods they are supplements to accepted way of treatment.
what is inflammatory breast cancer how is it different from other cancers?
ibc occurs suddenly with breast pain redness or swelling or a rash. mammograms are often negative because the tumor cells grow in a sheet and don't form a lump. it is very fast-growing and spreads quickly. immediate chemotherapy is needed. it looks like an infection so doctors often try antibiotics first delaying diagnosis. see a medical oncologist immediately if you have these symptoms.
what is inflammatory breast cancer how is it different from other cancers?
inflammatory breast cancer is so named because it spreads from the breast ducts into the lymphatics of the skin of the breast giving the breast an appearance like an infection. when diagnosed it is assumed that cancer cells have already spread throughout the body; therefore our first line of therapy is chemotherapy followed by mastectomy and radiation therapy.
what is inflammatory breast cancer how is it different from other cancers?
inflammatory breast cancer is a very aggressive and rare firm of breast cancer that is defined by invasion of the dermal lymphatic channels in ones skin. this presents as a red spreading rash on the skin and may or may not be associated with an actual mass in the breast. skin biopsy is used to diagnose it. aggressive tx includes chemotherapy mastectomy and radiation. reconstruction possible.
what is inflammatory breast cancer how is it different from other cancers?
inflammatory breast cancer is a rare and very aggressive disease in which cancer cells block lymph vessels in the skin of the breast. this type of breast cancer is called “inflammatory” because the breast often looks swollen and red or “inflamed. ” inflammatory breast cancer accounts for 1 to 5 percent of all breast cancers diagnosed in the united states.
why is metastatic breast cancer difficult to treat?
there are many treatments for metastatic breast cancer which can control it for years. although it can be treated it is rarely cured. that is because cancer cells are constantly mutating so treatments lose effectiveness. metastatic breast cancer requires constant treatment with either hormone therapy chemotherapy or biologic therapy. treatments are changed as they lose effectiveness.
why is metastatic breast cancer difficult to treat?
metastatic breast cancer means it has spread to other parts of a person's body. at this stage currently it is not curable. but definitely there are therapies of many types to hopefully control the disease. surgical chemotherapy radiation and more. it is true that some types of breast cancer are more aggressive and less treatable--only because we haven't found out what makes that type "tick".

breast cancer is cancer arising in the breast tissue. the most common tissue is the breast duct.
what is the difference between breast cancer and tissue cancer?
there are several different types of breast cancers but generally speaking they are much more common than tissue cancers (sarcomas). breast cancers can be more susceptible to hormones (estrogen progesterone) also the treatments for two different types of cancers are quite different.
when should i have a mammography screening?
the u. s. department of health and human services american cancer society american medical association and the american college of radiology recommend screening mammography every year for women beginning at age 40. those with a family history of a 1st degree relative (like your mother or sister) having been diagnosed premenopausally with breast cancer start 10 years before the age of diagnosis.
when should i have a mammography screening?
it is well-established that mammograms will find breast cancers well before most people would ever palpate it and in defined age groups saves lives. controversy exists whether to start screening at age 50 or 40; in the us most doctors recommend yearly mammograms at 40. it is also controversial whether to get mammograms after age 75;; this is more dependent on a woman's physiologic age.
what are the non-genetic causes of breast cancer for the women?
most cases of breast cancer in the us are unrelated to genetics and are believed to be due to our environment. breast cancer is a disease of the modern world and is much less common in developing nations. whether it is a byproduct of what we breathe and/or what we eat the exact causes are unclear. however we do see cancer more commonly in women with early menarche late menopause etc.
what are the non-genetic causes of breast cancer for the women?
the majority of women who develop breast cancer have no family history of breast cancer. risk factors include estrogen therapy obesity early menarche late menopause and sometimes just plain bad luck.
what sort of tests are normally done for breast cancer?
to diagnose breast cancer mammogram ultrasound and biopsy or done. sometimes an mri of the breasts are done depending on the situation. basic blood work and good history will help determine if other scans need to be done to look for spread.
what sort of tests are normally done for breast cancer?
for screening typically a mammogram and a clinical breast exam performed by your medical provider are recommended. for any abnormalities that are detected a biopsy is performed usually with a needle that is passed through the skin into the breast to obtain a sample. for more specifics you would discuss with your doctor.
what type of cancer has her2 receptors?
overexpression of the her2/neu receptor is found in app. 25% of breast cancer patients and is associated with more aggressive cancers. this overexpression may also be found in patients with ovarian- stomach- and uterine cancer. herceptin (trastuzumab) is a drug used to target these cancer cells and suppress their growth.
what causes lymphedema?
the most common cause of lymphedema is removal of lymph nodes (lns) as part of breast cancer surgery. when combined with radiation therapy lymphedema may develop in as many as 25% of patients. over the past decade a less invasive technique for ln evaluation called sentinel ln biopsy has reduced this rate down to less than 5%.
what are the odds of dying from breast cancer?
5-year breast cancer survival rates are dependent upon the cancer stage varying from almost 100% for dcis (stage 0) to less than 20% for metastatic disease (stage 4). furthermore cancer survival is dependent upon the response to chemotherapy. of note breast cancer survival has increased over the past decade in the us.
what are the odds of dying from breast cancer?
our hope is that everyone will be diagnosed with breast cancer at an early stage and be treated sucessfully. unfortunately many women still do not get mammograms and are detected with cancer at late stages. the odds of dying depend on the stage of the breast cancer and response to treatment. do not think about dying shift your thoughts to surviving and beating cancer.
what are the treatment options for treating dcis?
first-line therapy for dcis is surgery which may involve a lumpectomy or a mastectomy depending upon the growth pattern of the dcis. following lumpectomy radiation therapy (rt) is often recommended to lower the risk of cancer recurrence. furthermore tamoxifen may be recommended to prevent a second breast cancer from developing.
who should avoid taking tamoxifen?
tamoxifen is most often prescribed for the prevention or treatment of hormone-sensitive breast cancer. tamoxifen may increase the risk of blood clots strokes uterine cancer and cataracts however the benefits usually outweigh the risk. pregnancy should be avoided when on tamoxifen due to it's association with birth defects in animal studies.
why would my doctor tell me to avoid tamoxifen?
tamoxifen is a very effective drug for the prevention and treatment of hormone-sensitive breast cancer. however like all medications there are small risks associated with tamoxifen including a risk of blood clots stroke uterine cancer and cataracts. i would suspect that your dr. felt that the risks outweighed the benefits in your case or that your cancer was not sensitive to tamoxifen.
why would my doctor tell me to avoid tamoxifen?
i recommend speaking with you doctor. do you have breast cancer? it would be a good idea to get a 2nd opinion.
what kinds of breast cancer are fueled by hormones?
breast cancers that have receptors for estrogen and progesterone are fueled by hormones. these are the so called er and pr positive tumors. hormone therapy plays and important role in the treatment of these types of breast cancers.
what kinds of breast cancer are fueled by hormones?
breast cancer can be differentiated into 2 groups: those that have estrogen and/or progesterone receptors and those that do not. these receptors are proteins that are present on normal breast cells as well. these natural hormones fit into these receptors like a lock-and-key to stimulate these cells. "anti-estrogen" chemotherapeutics can take advantage of these receptors and disable these cells.
will an aromatase inhibitor help me get rid of my male gynecomastia?
make sure gynecomastia is the correct diagnosis. breast cancer in male patients is very rare but can be potentially life threatening. using medications such as an aromatase inhibitor for breast swelling before eliminating the diagnosis of breast cancer can be potentially serious. check with your doctor for details.
what is the role of tamoxifen in the treatment of breast cancer?
tamoxifen is a very effective drug for the treatment of hormone-sensitive (estrogen receptor +) breast cancers. it may be used alone or in combination with traditional iv chemotherapy depending on the cancer stage. furthermore tamoxifen has been shown to be effective reducing the chance of developing breast cancer in high-risk women ("chemoprevention").
what is the role of tamoxifen in the treatment of breast cancer?
tamoxifen is one of the anti-estrogen agents used to treat breast cancer. cancers that exhibit an estrogen receptor (er positive tumors) are treated in part by blocking the estrogen that act as signals to these tumors to grow.
what are the criteria for breast reconstruction surgery eligibility?
breast reconstruction surgery is a common surgical practice to help restore and recreate a woman's breasts following a mastectomy for breast cancer. surgical techniques may use implants or a patient's own tissue to recreate the breast. also most women don't realize that breast reconstruction is covered by health insurance rather than being a cosmetic operation you would have to pay for.
will i be able to keep my nipples during a mastectomy?
most commonly a mastectomy for breast cancer includes removal of the nipple and areola. there is a type of mastectomy called nipple sparing mastectomy. this procedure may not be appropriate for cancer treatment in many situations. you need to talk to your breast surgeon to see if your condition is suitable for this procedure. not all surgeons do this procedure.
will i be able to keep my nipples during a mastectomy?
when a mast-x is recommended to treat a breast cancer this usually includes removal of the nipple-areolar complex. in recent years studies have shown that select cancers can be treated by sparing the nipple and areola. furthermore when performing a mast-x to prevent cancer ("prophylactic mast-x") the nipple-areolar complex is often spared especially when combined with a reconstruction.
what are metastatic and recurrent breast cancer? are they more dangerous?
metastatic breast cancer refers to breast cancer cells that have traveled from the breast to distant sites of the body.
what are metastatic and recurrent breast cancer? are they more dangerous?
"recurrent" breast cancer may imply cancer coming back in the same breast following a lumpectomy a new cancer developing in the opposite breast or the presence of breast cancer cells that spread to another organ in the body ("metastases"). each of these types of recurrences are managed differently; metastatic disease is the most serious.
what is the average survival rate for metastasized breast cancer?
the 5-year survival rate for women with metastasized breast cancer (stage 4) is 15%. that means that 15% of patients who are diagnosed with metastatic breast cancer will live at least 5 years after their diagnosis. **source: national cancer database.
what is the average survival rate for metastasized breast cancer?
this depends on multiple factors. your overall health age response to treatment etc. more information on survival curves can be found at www. cancer. org.
what is the difference between gynecomastia male breast cancer?
gynecomastia is a benign condition usually caused by drug abuse or prescription medications. on the other hand male breast cancer is malignant and can spread through metastasis. fortunately it is rare for males to develop breast cancer.
what is the difference between gynecomastia male breast cancer?
gynecomastia is excess benign male breast tissue. cancer is malignant and must be treated.
what is the difference between gynecomastia male breast cancer?
gynecomastia is a benign condition. breast cancer is malignant.
what is the difference between gynecomastia male breast cancer?
the enlargement of of the breast gland in the male & is not malignant.
what happens during a mastectomy?
the standard surgical treatment for breast cancer modified radical mastectomy involves removal of all breast tissue including the nipple and areola as well as some of the lymph nodes under the armpit. simple or total mast-x is identical except no lymph nodes are removed. selected patients may be treated without skin removal (nipple and/or areolar sparing mast-x; sub-q mast-x)
what exactly is metastatic breast cancer?
metastatic breast cancer is cancer that started in the breast but has spread into other places like the liver lung bones or brain. it is also called stage 4 breast cancer. it is not usually curable but many women live with metastatic breast cancer for years with ongoing treatment.
what exactly is metastatic breast cancer?
metastasis occurs when a cancer spreads outside of its organ of origin. therefore metastatic breast cancer is when breast cancer has spread to involve other organs outside of the breast such as the lymph nodes liver lung etc.
what exactly is metastatic breast cancer?
metastatic breast cancer refers to breast cancer cells that have traveled from the breast through the lymphatic system to distant locations in the body.
what are the usual symptoms of breast cancer?
the most common symptom of breast cancer is no symptoms at all. it is important to perform your screening mammography as prescribed by your physician. the best chance for a cure happens when breast cancer is detected at the earliest stages.
what are the usual symptoms of breast cancer?
the most common symptom is the presence of a lump in the breast. other symptoms include nipple discharge nipple inversion skin indentation and breast pain. nevertheless the majority of people diagnosed with breast cancer have no symptoms whatsoever.
what percentage of atypical hyperplasia becomes breast cancer?
in a recent study in the annals of surgical oncology they looked at how many surgical excisions performed for atypical hyperplasia displayed either dcis or cancer. out of the cases that the study reviewed only about 1% of the cases upstaged to either dcis or cancer.
what percentage of atypical hyperplasia becomes breast cancer?
atypical hyperplasia is not a precancerous condition--it does not turn into cancer in any patient. however people who have atypical hyperplasia have a 2-4 fold increased lifetime risk for developing breast cancer in either breast regardless of which breast the atypia was found in.
will my chances of getting breast cancer increase if i don't breast feed?
your risk depends on many factors. you should discuss your concerns with your friendly primary care physician.
will my chances of getting breast cancer increase if i don't breast feed?
breast feeding per se lowers your risk but pales in comparison to carrying to term a pregnancy before your are 23 yo. - that has more benefit - but hold the horses- i got three daughters myself and would not use that as an excuse for an early pregnancy. we are working at fox chase on chromosomal changes that occur with pregnancy to see if we can elucidate those changes that give that benefit.
will my chances of getting breast cancer increase if i don't breast feed?
the evidence linking breastfeeding and risk of breast cancer is weak at best. prolonged breast feeding may reduce risk but is likely due to fewer menstrual cycles over the lifetime not due to breastfeeding.
what are some similarities and differences between tamoxefen and femara (letrozole)?
both tamoxifen and femara (letrozole) are drugs used to treat patients with estrogen receptor positive breast cancer. each drug affects breast cancer cells through a slightly different mechanism of action. tamoxifen can be used for all women whereas femara (letrozole) is only used after menopause.
what exactly is tamoxifen therapy?
tamoxifen is an "anti-estrogen" pill used to treat certain breast cancers. it is typically prescribed for 5 years. while it does not cause typical side-effects seen with traditional chemotherapy (hair loss nausea) it is a very effective chemotherapeutic drug for estrogen-positive breast cancers. like all medications side effects are common and the medication is not suitable for all patients.
what sorts of chemotherapy are most common for breast cancer?
there are many different regimens utilizing multiple drugs and ranging 3-6 months. common drugs are anthracyclines taxanes and cytoxan (cyclophosphamide) in various combinations - acx4 tcx4(or 6) tac x 6 acx4 ->tx4 dose dense ac->t weekly taxol. other options/drugs can also be considered in the metastatic setting. a patient should seek a medical oncologist experience in breast to rec the best regimen.
what sorts of chemotherapy are most common for breast cancer?
it all depends on the cancer's subtype er. /pr her-2 status or in the future microarray analysis -the treatment is individualized on the tumor and patient characteristics number of nodes may dictate extra cycles of chemo +/- radiation. dose dense every 2 weeks at a lower dose is popular alternative versus every 3 weeks larger dose with neulasta (pegfilgrastim) recovery. if her2+ than added herceptin for a yr.
which doctor should i go to for lymphedema?
the best way to treat lymphedema is by compression therapy performed by a specially-trained physical therapist. any doctor can refer you to a physical therapist however breast cancer surgeons are most familiar with this complication.
what is the earliest age at which you can get breast cancer?
breast cancer in teenagers is rare but can happen. the average age for developing breast cancer is 65.
what is the earliest age at which you can get breast cancer?
though we can see unusual breast malignancies (sarcomas) in the pediatric / adolescent age groups the usual epithelial based cancers that you would know as infiltrating ductal or lobular carcinoma are in older women. as a guideline- less than 5%of cases are under 30 yo increasing from there with each decade. genetic mutations (brca 1 or 2) would shift the curve toward a younger age of onset.
what are the effects of breast cancer on the body?
the hope is to diagnosis breast cancer when it is confined to the breast. at this stage the cancer does not affect the rest of the body but the treatments can (side effects). when a cancer spreads the effects depend on the area of the body that contains the cells that have spread. most common: lungs liver brain bone.
what are the effects of breast cancer on the body?
cancer cells follow no rules. they start in one organ then spread to other parts wreaking havoc along the way. the tumors will then interfere with the normal functions of the body until they become overwhelmed then start to shut down ultimately leading to death. that's why it's important to find cancer in an early stage when treatment is most effective.
what is the possibility of a women going into remission for breast cancer without any treatment?
it depends on the type of breast cancer the size and the stage. if the cancer is stage 0 (dcis or ductal carcinoma in situ) there's a chance it may not progress. the few studies on this topic show that women with invasive breast cancer stage i or higher who choose only alternative therapies ultimately die from breast cancer. with treatment we can cure most breast cancer!
what is the possibility of a women going into remission for breast cancer without any treatment?
as a woman i would not ever take that chance. as a physcian i would recommend the standard of care for a particular type of breast cancer. i personally do not know of any invasive breast cancers that have gone into complete remission or cure? without treatment. maybe those patients do exist? i have been a physician for almost 32 years. i do believe in the mind--body connection and spirituality.
what is the possibility of a women going into remission for breast cancer without any treatment?
it would be unlikely.
what are the odds of getting breast cancer twice?
the risk of developing a second breast cancer varies with the age of the patient and whether they have the hereditary or environmental form of breast cancer. in general this rate varies between 0. 5-3%.
what are the odds of getting breast cancer twice?
this is a difficult question to answer in a general fashion. knowing the specifics of the first breast cancer like stage and treatment are important. also risk factors like family history and brca status play a role. i recommend you contact your oncologist or surgeon and possibly a genetic cancer to review your individual risk and get a personalized answer.
what does the brca in brca1 stand for?
women w/ 2+ immediate family members w/ a hx of breast/ovarian ca at 50% chance of developing breast cancer. if you have it get screened with ca-125 blood test ultrasound mammogram/mri usually starting at age 30. surgery after childbearing.
what does the brca in brca1 stand for?
the brca in brca1 and brca2 stands for breast cancer susceptibility gene. they are a type of gene known as tumor suppressor genes.
what does the brca in brca1 stand for?
"br" stands for breast "ca" stands for cancer in the mid-1990's after years of research two genes were found that are changed in many families with breast cancer. the first gene was named brca1 and the second gene was named brca2.
what does the brca in brca1 stand for?
breast cancer is my guess. genetic researchers can actually come up with some crazy names and abbreviations. the fruitfly researchers i know tend to be even wackier. fortunately these researchers chose something straightforward and memorable which helps spread the word of such a serious disease.
what does the brca in brca1 stand for?
brca is short for breast cancer. that's because mutations in these genes increase the risk for breast cancer. the mutations also increase the risk for other cancers but the higher rate of breast cancer was identified first so that's how the genes were named.
what are the treatment options for metastatic breast cancer?
it depends on the "personality" of the cancer ie whether it has the estrogen receptor progesterone receptor or her2. it also depends on where the cancer is. er+ cancer that has spread only to bone can often be treated with anti-estrogen pills alone while cancer in the liver lungs or brain often requires chemotherapy. women can live for years with metastatic breast cancer.
what are the treatment options for metastatic breast cancer?
treatment for metastatic breast cancer is aimed at delaying the progression of the disease prolonging life relieving any symptoms caused by the cancer and improving daily quality of life. chemotherapy hormonal therapy and monoclonal antibody therapies can all be used to achieve this depending on the type of breast cancer. for detailed information please visit www. cancer. org.
what is usp tamoxifen citrate commonly used for?
tamoxifen is most commonly prescribed for the treatment of estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer typically in women diagnosed prior to menopause. it may also be used to prevent breast cancer in high-risk patients. following menopause a class of drugs very similar to tamoxifen called aromatase inhibitors are preferentially used for breast cancer treatment rather than tamoxifen.
what is usp tamoxifen citrate commonly used for?
tamoxifen is an agonist or antagonist of estrogen. since many breast cancers grow more in the presence of the hormone estrogen one way to stop its growth is to utilize a drug such as tamoxifen.
what is the difference between an mammogram and a ultrasound?
if you have a lump that can be felt it's likely the radiologist will want an ultrasound as well as mammogram. mammogram uses x-rays to see calcifications that might indicate a breast cancer while ultrasound uses sound waves to see different characteristics of breast tissue such as blood flow size and shape of a lump and whether it's solid or cystic. ultrasound is also used to guide biopsy.
what is the likelihood of breast cancer recurrence?
breast cancer may recur either in the breast ("local recurrence") or elsewhere in the body (distant metastasis). the risk of metastasis varies from very low to high and is correlated with the stage of the cancer; the stage is associated with the size of the cancer and lymph node involvement. local recurrence following lumpectomy and radiation therapy is less than 5%.
what is the likelihood of breast cancer recurrence?
will depend on the stage of disease the prognostic factors ( er/pr/her2neu/ki-67 etc) treatment received presence of particular genetical abnormality ( brca 1/2 for instance).
what exactly is breast cancer reconstruction? is it safe?
reconstruction of the breasts is restoring the breast shape as much as possible to normal after breast cancer treatment has caused a deformity. sometimes cancer treatment removes part of a breast and sometimes the entire breast. there are many options that you can chose from after having a long discussion between your plastic surgeon oncologist and yourself.
what exactly is breast cancer reconstruction? is it safe?
breast reconstruction is the rebuilding of a breast usually after breast cancer (mastectomy or lumpectomy). the patient's own tissue (from another part of the body) or a breast implant can be used. more than 1 surgery is often needed. the nipple and areola can also be reconstructed. some patients also have surgery on the other breast for best symmetry. it is safe in good surgical candidates.
what exactly is breast cancer reconstruction? is it safe?
breast reconstruction refers to a general set of procedures to restore a breast to "normal. " it carries its own specific risks and benefits as well as complications. you health status your smoking status and body mass index as well as the stage of your cancer usually defines how well reconstruction is suited for you. otherwise it is relatively very safe.
what exactly is breast cancer reconstruction? is it safe?
reconstruction is a surgical procedure to create a new breast following a mastectomy. this may be as simple as placing an implant or as complicated as performing a tissue transfer from the abdominal wall or back. like all surgical procedures there are risks associated with the operation yet most healthy people are excellent candidates following mastectomy.
which kind of doctor administers or prescribes tamoxifen?
it depends on what the tamoxifen is being used to treat. if used to treat breast cancer it is mostly prescribed by an oncologist. however tamoxifen can also be used as treatment for severe breast pain/fibrocystic disease or for breast cancer prevention. in those cases a primary care physician general surgeon or gynecologist may prescribe it.
which kind of doctor administers or prescribes tamoxifen?
tamoxifen is given as part of treatment of breast cancer or for reducing the risk of getting breast cancer in high risk women. for treatment it is usually given by a medical oncologist. some breast or oncologic surgeons also prescribe it. as a preventetive medicine in addition to above speciaists a family physician or a gynecologist may also prescribe it if they are familiar with it and are comfortable to prescribe it.
what is a sentinel node biopsy procedure?
your surgeon will give a dye to look for these mother node or sentinel node if they are negative then they don't have to look for whole nodal area. usually biopsies in case of breast cancer or melanoma.
what are the pros and cons of breast reduction?
pros: decreased breast size and weight decreased pain in neck/shoulders/upper back easier to find bras that fit decreased risk of breast cancer. cons: scarring decreased breast milk production.
what is the latest recommendation for breast mammography?
the recommendation is yearly mammograms starting at age 40 unless you have a family history of breast cancer or ovarian cancer than you should visit with a breast specialist to determine the most effective screening plan for you.
what is the latest recommendation for breast mammography?
unless you have a strong family history of breast cancer or feel that there is something wrong with your breast yearly screening mammograms should begin at age 40 and continue until no longer physically able. please do not be confused by the media's attack on yearly mammography - nearly all the major reputable health organizations recommend yearly exams beginning at age 40.
what is the latest recommendation for breast mammography?
mammograms should be done yearly at age 40 unless there is a family history of breast cancer or if a mass is found by the patient or a physician during an exam.
what does early-stage breast cancer actually mean?
early stage breast cancer means breast cancer that is curable and has spread only to local lymph nodes. stage 1 2a 2b and 3a breast cancers are considered early stage.
what does early-stage breast cancer actually mean?
early stage breast cancer usually means cancer that is limited to the breast and that has not spread to the lymph nodes or distant organs.
what's my chance of surviving breast cancer with each type of surgery?
in general survival from breast cancer depends on a multitude of other factors not just the type of surgery. however if all other things are the same the type of surgery does not seem to matter much. studies have proven that a mastectomy (complete removal of the breast) achieves equivalent cancer outcomes to a lumpectomy plus radiation (removal of just the cancer followed by radiation).
what's my chance of surviving breast cancer with each type of surgery?
for early stage breast cancer there is no difference in survival whether you have a mastectomy or a lumpectomy. but you are more likely to have cancer come back in your breast after a lumpectomy which would require further surgery (usually a mastectomy). 1 in 12 women have breast cancer return in the breast within 10 years after a lumpectomy + radiation.
what's my chance of surviving breast cancer with each type of surgery?
survival data or prognosis is very dependent on stage of the cancer and the response to each tumor by therapy. in general the type of surgery mastectomy versus a lumpectomy when coupled with radiation therapy does not influence the survival.
what's my chance of surviving breast cancer with each type of surgery?
days of more surgery means better survival are long gone. survival is dependent on multidisciplinary treatments including radiotherapy chemotherapy and targeted theapy.
what are the risks to getting a mammogram?
like all xray studies there is a small dose of radiation associated with mammography however the benefit of finding cancers early outweighs this risk. mammograms are not perfect: some cancers can be missed some 'suspicious' abnormalities end up being benign. however it's the best most cost-effective screening test for breast cancer: mammograms save lives!
why would a breast mri be recommended when you have breast cancer?
preoperative treatment planning or to assess neo adjuvant chemotherapy response. mri is the most accurate imaging modality for assessing the extent of the cancer. it is also useful for diagnosing multi centric/multi focal cancers and cancers in the contraleyeral breast
why would a breast mri be recommended when you have breast cancer?
i too agree with the use of mri in preop planning for finding additional cancer (in the same breast or the other breast) and for post treatment (after chemotheraphy or surgery). there are other scenarios where breast mri is useful as well. in my opinion mri of the breasts is underutilized.
why would a breast mri be recommended when you have breast cancer?
breast mri should be performed before surgery for breast cancer. mri finds additional cancer in the breast with known cancer up to 23% of the time (sometimes changing a lumpectomy to mastectomy) and cancer in the opposite breast up to 8% of the time. breast mri can be used to screen women after lumpectomy for recurrence. it is extremely sensitive finding nearly 100% of breast cancer.
why would a breast mri be recommended when you have breast cancer?
this is controversial. an mri is an additional tool in breast imaging. the sensitivity of mri is high and it may pick up smaller cancer that were not detected on mammogram. it may also lead to increase false positives and unnecessary procedures.
what is the mammogram typically used for?
mammogram is used to detect breast cancer.
what is the mammogram typically used for?
their are two main uses for mammography: the early detection of breast cancer in asymptomatic women(screening mammo) and to further evaluate a lump or other symptom(diagnostic mammo).
will radiation for breast cancer increase my risk for other cancers?
talk to your doctor about this risk and steps for prevention.
will radiation for breast cancer increase my risk for other cancers?
with current technology in radiation oncology the risk of developing a cancer from the radiation is dramatically lower than with the older technology and techniques.
what is gynecomastia in men?
breast tissue forming in a male is usually a side effect of medications or illicit drug use but can be a risk for development of breast cancer in men. your doctor should do a history and an exam to rule out any serious illness and offer treatment options.
what is gynecomastia in men?
men have breast tissue just as women do. under the right circumstances the breast tissue in a male can enlarge. this can be due to hormonal changes such as puberty or due to medications used to treat common conditions such as gi disorders or psychiatric illnesses. certain tumors could cause this to happen as well. men do get breast cancer so this should be considered in such cases.
what are the statistics for women in the us that are killed by breast cancer? my great aunt had breast cancer and it made me think about the possibilities of my or any of my potential children getting breast cancer. it's frightening.
a great resource to look at cancer statitics is the american cancer society website.
what are the statistics for women in the us that are killed by breast cancer? my great aunt had breast cancer and it made me think about the possibilities of my or any of my potential children getting breast cancer. it's frightening.
studies have shown that about 12% of women born today will be diagnosed with breast cancer. while it is not known why some women get breast cancer and some do not there are things you can do to reduce your risks. do a breast exam regularly (atleast once a month) to screen for any lumps in your breats tissue. early detection is highly recommended. if you are age 50 or older make sure you get screened via mammogram regularly. if you have a family history of breast cancer talk to your health care provider about recommendations to begin early detection.
what options do i have for construction after breast cancer removal surgery? i am a woman in my mid 30s diagnosed with left breast cancer and treated with total removal of my left breast. what options do i have for symmetry again? how many operations do w
what you are describing would involve a delayed breast reconstruction since it is after the mastectomy has been performed it it has been allowed to heal. from description i do not know whether or not you had radiation treatment after your mastectomy. if you had radiation treatment then i recommend your own tissue through the use of flap surgery or fat grafting. expander if no radiation in past!
what options do i have for construction after breast cancer removal surgery? i am a woman in my mid 30s diagnosed with left breast cancer and treated with total removal of my left breast. what options do i have for symmetry again? how many operations do w
the most common procedure is to place a tissue expander on the side of the mastectomy. the tissue is then expanded to equal the other side. soemtimes the other side may sag or droop and we do a breast lift to create symmetry and on occasion we also augment that side as well. there are a lot of optionsavailable and insurance will pay for this.
what options do i have for construction after breast cancer removal surgery? i am a woman in my mid 30s diagnosed with left breast cancer and treated with total removal of my left breast. what options do i have for symmetry again? how many operations do w
very hard over the internet to offer the correct options in reconstruction and contralateral surgery for the breast symmetry. options include; tissue expander lats flap from back tram flap microsurgery flap newest option is fat grafts. for the other breast and reduction implant or lift. if you like call my office to set up an appointment 305 598 0091 regards dr b.
what options do i have for construction after breast cancer removal surgery? i am a woman in my mid 30s diagnosed with left breast cancer and treated with total removal of my left breast. what options do i have for symmetry again? how many operations do w
i am a breast augmentation expert but not a breast reconstruction expert. you of course realize that you might have the option of an implant (may require initial tissue expansion) or of a tissue flap. one issue that you should consider is fat transfer. i know that least one sub-specialized microvascular reconstruction expert that only uses fat transfer - he has abandoned his previous surgical training. one doctor that is a fat transfer expert is mario diana in san antonio. goodluck!
what are the chances of an adolescent having breast cancer?
in a recent review of the largest us database of breast cancer the incidence of breast cancer in teenagers was 0. 08 cases per 100 000 people. so while not unheard of it's safe to say that one shouldn't spend any energy worrying about it. while the lifetime risk of breast cancer in us women is 1:8 the incidence increases with age.
what are the chances of an adolescent having breast cancer?
it would be exceedingly rare.
what are the chances of an adolescent having breast cancer?
most of breast mass in adolescent girls is a benign condition i. e. fibroadenoma. even most women with genetic predisposition(brca1 2 gene) to develop breast cancer develop one in the third decade or later of their life.
what are the odds of a nineteen year old having breast cancer?
it would be exceedingly rare.
what are the odds of a nineteen year old having breast cancer?
it is possible thus a lump that persists visualized by ultrasound perhaps a mri would have to biopsied to truly be determined that it was benign and not cancerous. you can't determine cancer definitively by any other test than expert pathologic diagnostic tests-- biopsy the suspect area. i know that both patients and physicians don't want to do "needless" biopsies that are benign. but.
why are women getting mastectomies just because there is a chance of breast cancer?
unfortunately some women are at such high risk for breast cancer that at the present time the best means of prevention is to undergo bilateral 'prophylactic' mastectomies. quite often these people have watched loved-ones have breast (or ovarian) cancer and have lived with the fear that their cancer was inevitable. though extreme this operation often leads to a much better quality of life.
why are women getting mastectomies just because there is a chance of breast cancer?
women entering their first diagnosis can't bear the thought of repeat. mds need to do a better job of educating. what generally determines prognosis is the staging at diagnosis of the 1st cancer so the focus needs to be making sure that is treated most appropriately. still "peace of mind" is often a huge and important factor.
why are women getting mastectomies just because there is a chance of breast cancer?
besides the fear factor some women who have the brca mutations are carrying a very high risk of breast cancer- there is data that prophylactic bilateral mastectomies can be helpful in this situation.
why are women getting mastectomies just because there is a chance of breast cancer?
many patients when confronted with the prospect of monitoring the other breast as well as the breast that has cancer consider their options and choose to bilateral mastectomies. these are incredibly difficult decisions for patients. your lifestyle family history health condition current social situation all play roles in the decision making process. as a reconstructive surgeon i try just to help.
when is breast mri recommended for breast cancer screening? is it for the earlier stage or later stage
yearlly breast mri in addition to mammography is recommended for women with a 20-25% risk of breast cancer as determined by a lifetime risk calculator for women who have the breast cancer gene who had radiation to the chest for hodgekins disease between 10 & 30 years sometimes for women who have been treated for breast cancer and for women with a few rare syndromes. to detect cancer early.
when is breast mri recommended for breast cancer screening? is it for the earlier stage or later stage
mri for screening is a test like a mammogram whose goal is early detection. it is only recommended in certain situations that should be determined by a trained breast specialist. in the context of breast cancer there is not a routine guideline for when mri is utilized except for lobular breast cancers. the decision to order an mri when someone is diagnosed is typically made by the surgeon.
when is breast mri recommended for breast cancer screening? is it for the earlier stage or later stage
used in practice. it is indicated in dense breasts those with child hood thoracic radiotherapy and genetic cancer syndromes (brca 1 2). they are associated with a 30% false positive when used routinely in every newly diagnosed breast cancer leading to unnecessary procedures and increased cost.
when is breast mri recommended for breast cancer screening? is it for the earlier stage or later stage
screening studies do not determine the stage of a breast cancer. a screening examination is one that is done in healthy patients in order to find a breast cancer hopefully in an early stage of the disease. mri is recommended for screening in only the following very special circumstances: -have a known breast cance susceptibility mutation (brca1 or brca2 gene mutation) -have a first-degree relative (mother father brother sister or child) with a brca1 or brca2 gene mutation and have not had genetic testing themselves -have a lifetime risk of breast cancer of 20-25% or greater according to risk assessment tools that are based mainly on family history -had radiation therapy to the chest for another type of cancer such as hodgkinâ€™s disease when they were between the ages of 10 and 30 years -have a genetic disease such as li-fraumeni syndrome cowden syndrome or bannayan-riley-ruvalcaba syndrome or have one of these syndromes in first-degree relatives women with the following issues should also discuss the role of screening mri for them with their doctor: -a personal history of breast cancer ductal carcinoma in situ (dcis) lobular carcinoma in situ (lcis) or abnormal breast cell changes such as atypical ductal hyperplasia or atypical lobular hyperplasia -have extremely dense breasts or unevenly dense breasts when viewed by mammograms. otherwise standard mammograms are the best screening at this time as mris may result in a lot of false findings and unnecessary biopsies. mri can also sometimes be helpful in women already diagnosed with breast cancer to help determine the optimal surgical treatment for them.
what is the bigget risk factor for breast cancer?
1 in 8 women in the us will develop breast cancer in their lifetime therefore no woman should feel immune to this disease. the best chance for cure exists when we catch the cancer before it causes any symptoms; the best test to find breast cancer is a mammogram. i recommend beginning mammography at age 40 unless one has a family history of breast cancer at an early age. mammograms save lives.
what is the bigget risk factor for breast cancer?
being a female with breast - #1 risk factor. other risk factors: early menses late menopause 1st child at 35 no children hormone replacement therapy alcohol family history and being a carrier of brca1/brca2 genes.
what is the bigget risk factor for breast cancer?
probably the highest risk factor is inheritance meaning mother sisters etc you can be tested for a gene for female cancer named braca gene which if positive gives you a high risk for cancer.
what is the bigget risk factor for breast cancer?
the strongest risk factor is jews women with brca1/2 mutation.
what are the chances of a female who's mother and maternal aunt have breast cancer getting breast cancer herself?
this is calculated with the gail model and specific info is needed: age of person in q; her age at first period; age at which first child born; number of first degree relatives with breast cancer [mother sister daughter]; has she had a breast biopsy? ; was it pos or negative? was there atypia? what is her race? this calculates a risk and compares that too the general population.
what are the chances of a female who's mother and maternal aunt have breast cancer getting breast cancer herself?
85% of breast cancers occur sporadically meaning there is no family history. the risk is 2x higher if a 1st degree relative (mother sister) has breast cancer. the message is all women are at risk. get your mammogram done. the best protection is early detection.
what are the chances of a female who's mother and maternal aunt have breast cancer getting breast cancer herself?
the presence of more than one first degree relative with breast cancer multiplies the risk 2-3 times compared to a woman without any family history. overall the risk is still low and if the famliy members had their breast cancer at a young age then genetic testing can be considered.
well i have gynecomatsia and it is not responding to training so some friends told me to take amino acids or steriods instead of surgery is it ok?
please get evaluated by a breast specialist. you will want to be sure this is truly gynecomastia and not a suspicious mass. men can get breast cancer too! be safe and get checked out.
what's the survival rate of stage4 breast cancer? my mom is a stage 4 patient for several years now.
this is great news - focus in the time you have with your mother. today women are living longer with stage 4 breast cancer due to better treatments targeted therapies and growing understanding that breast cancer is not one disease. congratulations.
what's the survival rate of stage4 breast cancer? my mom is a stage 4 patient for several years now.
this is hard to answer without knowing the specific biology of your mom's cancer and which organs are involved. nowadays we consider stage iv breast ca like a chronic illness; one we cannot cure but we can often manage and control very well. it sounds like your mom is being managed very well considering her survival for several years already.
what's the survival rate of stage4 breast cancer? my mom is a stage 4 patient for several years now.
stage 4 breast cancer can have various survival length. the rule of thumb is 6 months but i guess there are more exceptions than than the rule. i had a patient who was stage 4 with metastases to the bones who lived ~3 years with it. it finally killed her. metastases anywhere else usually kill the patient quicker.
will eating kale help fight breast cancer?
there are no specific dietary factors known to prevent breast cancer. however kale and many other vegetables contain tremendous amounts of trace vitamins and other nutrients including anti-oxidants which may help reduce the risk of developing a cancer. in general a low-fat plant-based diet is healthier and can be considered preventative for many chronic diseases as well as cancer.
will eating kale help fight breast cancer?
being healthy and maintaining an ideal body weight will help to reduce your risks but not eliminate them. i am not aware of kale having any special properties fighting breast cancer.
will eating kale help fight breast cancer?
agree with dr. attiai. lifelong intake of low fat diet high in fruit vegetable intake may be associated with decreased risk for a number of cancers. missed that boat and trying play catchup? couldn't hurt may not specifically impact on risk for getting recurrence or preventing new tumor but has other benefits to recommend it. diet is a factor but not a magic bullet unfortunately.
what are the chances of developing breast cancer after having stage ii nshl?
i assume by nshl you mean nodular sclerosing hodgkins lymphoma. your risk of breast cancer is higher than normal if you received radiation therapy to your mediastinum (chest) as part of treatment. the younger you are and the higher the radiation dose the higher your risk. breast mri is recommended for breast cancer screening in women who have received mediastinal radiation.
what are the chances of developing breast cancer after having stage ii nshl?
one out of every eight women will develop breast cancer over their lifetime. since you likely took chemotherapy and radiation your risk can raise by 10 to 15 percent over this amount. so every woman has a 12 percent chance of breast cancer and yours may be 14 percent.
what are "markers" and what does it mean to a breast cancer patient with stage 4 metastatic cancer when her markers go from 4 700 down to 53?
you must be referring to a particular tumor marker! tumor markers are used to track the progress of certain cancers. if your number has gone down to that level it means the modality of treating your brest cancer has been very effective! it does not necessarily mean you are in remission all it means is that your breast cancer has responded very well to the treatment you have received!
what are "markers" and what does it mean to a breast cancer patient with stage 4 metastatic cancer when her markers go from 4 700 down to 53?
tumor markers are molecules that circulate in the blood in some patients with cancer. there are many different markers so it is hard to give a specific answer. in general if a tumor marker is markedly elevated and then drops dramatically it is a sign that the chemotherapy is working and that cancer cells are being destroyed.
what are "markers" and what does it mean to a breast cancer patient with stage 4 metastatic cancer when her markers go from 4 700 down to 53?
tumor markers refer to proteins made by some cancers that can be measured with a blood test. we use them to see how well metastatic breast cancer is responding to treatment. when tumor markers go from the thousands down to the 50s oncologists like me jump for joy! that means her treatment is doing what we want it to do--killing lots of cancer cells!
what is the recovery period after having a tissue expansion treatment done? after my mastectomy my doctor suggested that i have a tissue expansion procedure done to help reconstruct my breasts. i have just spent a lot of time recovering from cancer and
first and foremost i wish you health courage and strength in your recovery from breast cancer. tissue expansion is a very common approach to breast reconstruction after mastectomy. very nice results can be achieved by expanding your own tissue to accommodate permanent breast implants. this approach gives you a lot of control over final size selection and avoids the risks associated with operations that remove tissue from other parts of your body to replace breast tissue. if i understand your question correctly you have already had a mastectomy and are now considering having tissue expanders placed after having healed from the first operation. the operation to secondarily place the expanders involves using the same incision made for the mastectomy creating a space under your chest muscle (pectoralis major or "pec") and sometimes using donor material to create a nicely shaped lower breast contour. there is some tightness and discomfort associated with placing the expanders and i typically recommend to my patients that they take about a week off of work. most women who work a desk job can return to their normal job functions in a week and not require narcotic pain meds during the day but women who work more strenuous physical jobs may need to be off work or on light duty (lifting less than 15 lbs) for about 4 weeks. depending on your plastic surgeon's preferences you will likely begin the expansion process about 3 weeks after the surgery to have the expanders placed. this involves coming in to your plastic surgeon's office every 1-3 weeks to have the expanders filled with a moderate volume of saline each time until you reach your desired size. the expansion itself involves minimal discomfort as a small needle is used to access and fill the expanders. you can return to work on the same day or the day following your expansions. surgery to place your permanent implants can proceed about 8 weeks after your size goal is reached and the permanent implants will feel softer and have a much more natural appearance than the filled expanders. all the best to you in your recovery dr. skourtis.
what is coming out of my nipples? only when i squeeze i get a semi-thick white substance. i can see it under the skin before i squeeze it. breast cancer does run in my family. i am 19 years old. no babies no piercings no birth control.
you describe leaking a white substance which is probably breast milk and we call it galactorrhea. breast milk formation is abnormal if it occurs more than 12 months after pregnancy lactation. you should have this checked to understand the cause. galactorrhea is caused by an excess of a hormone called prolactin. excess prolactin can be caused by intense suckling medications low thyroid hormone conditions (hypothyroid) excess estrogen (birth control pills) stress some unusual brain lesions or even non-cancerous pituitary tumors. if the galactorrhea is caused by a specific disease then you need the disease treated. if there is no significant disease and the amount of discharge is minimal then sometimes no treatment is necessary. if the galactorrhea is causing embarrassing wetness or simply bothers you but there is no other serious disorder then medication can stop decrease the prolactin levels and the breast milk. good luck.
what is coming out of my nipples? only when i squeeze i get a semi-thick white substance. i can see it under the skin before i squeeze it. breast cancer does run in my family. i am 19 years old. no babies no piercings no birth control.
cancer would not be the first thing that i think of. you should alert your friendly primary care physician to these symptoms. most likely physiologic.
what is coming out of my nipples? only when i squeeze i get a semi-thick white substance. i can see it under the skin before i squeeze it. breast cancer does run in my family. i am 19 years old. no babies no piercings no birth control.
the previous two doctors provided excellent information. if the material came from the area surrounding the nipple and not from the nipples themselves it could be a lubricant from the montgomery glands. they are in the dark skin surrounding the nipple (areola). these glands may blend in with the skin or may look like small bumps. if that is the case try not to squeeze them.
what is coming out of my nipples? only when i squeeze i get a semi-thick white substance. i can see it under the skin before i squeeze it. breast cancer does run in my family. i am 19 years old. no babies no piercings no birth control.
i agree with dr. opshahl that this is probably breast milk. the only way to tell for sure though is to see a doctor. so you need to do that. in the meantime do not squeeze the breasts or try to get the milk to come out. that only makes things worse. wear tight bras like sports bras. this can also cause your periods to become irregular or stop altogether so be prepared for that too. this is not something that should be ignored so talk to your doctor soon!
what are common proven alternatives to chemotherapy for breast cancer treatment?
chemotherapy is the administration of a drug that circulates throughout the body and kills cancer cells. our goal is to choose the most effective drug tailored to one's specific cancer subtype. if by "alternative" you mean alternative to proven standard therapy. no. however many of our "standard" drugs are well-tolerated w/o traditional side-effects like hair loss nausea etc.
what are common proven alternatives to chemotherapy for breast cancer treatment?
not every breast cancer needs chemotherapy and many are managed by surgery and hormone therapy with or without radiation.
what should i expect regarding stage 4 breast cancer that has spread to the liver?
there are many chemo options available. if it is stage 4 by virtue of minimal liver involvement-there is good medical data to talk with a liver surgeon to discuss removal of that portion of the liver. if there are other spots of tumor spread in the body then chemotherapy and hormone suppression therapy are the mainstays of treatment. focal radiation can help bone pain.
what should i expect regarding stage 4 breast cancer that has spread to the liver?
even though this is incurable there are many treatment options. a series of chemotherapy treatments can be utilised and trial drugs are also an option. every effort needs to be made to address other issues such as preserving liver function and supporting nutrition pain control etc.
what should i expect regarding stage 4 breast cancer that has spread to the liver?
this is obviously an aggressive tumor and you will need all your strength to fight it. options do exist and discuss with a good cancer doctor.
what should i expect regarding stage 4 breast cancer that has spread to the liver?
breast cancer in the liver means it is metastatic and cannot be cured. therapy exists making this a chronic disease and there are people on therapy for many years although breast cancer usually wins in the end. it is hopeful if this is the only location for metastatic lesions and also hopeful if it is hormone sensitive. your oncologist can tell you this.
when i have my daughter tested for brca gene? my husband's sister was diagnosed with stage 3 breast cancer. no other history of b. c. in our families.
if your sister in law had cancer before age 45 or had a triple negative cancer before age 60 she fits nccn criteria for brca testing even without family history. she needs to test first and if positive your husband should test and if he is positive then you test your girl. cancer can jump an individual but the gene cannot. hope all goes well with all in the family.
when i have my daughter tested for brca gene? my husband's sister was diagnosed with stage 3 breast cancer. no other history of b. c. in our families.
i am sorry to hear about your sister-in-law. in general when we are concerned about the hereditary form of breast cancer we test the affected person first. if they don't harbor the gene there is no need to test anyone else. keep in mind that 85-90% of all breast cancer cases are not hereditary. even if your sister-in-law has the gene your husband has a 50% chance as well and your daughter 25%.
when i have my daughter tested for brca gene? my husband's sister was diagnosed with stage 3 breast cancer. no other history of b. c. in our families.
a single person with breast cancer in the family is not generally considered a reason for brca testing. a history of multiple indviduals with breast or ovarian cancer or both is usually required. onset of cancers at an early age and breast cancer in male family members are also important. if your doc feels there is risk you and your daughter should receive genetic counciling before tests are done.
when i have my daughter tested for brca gene? my husband's sister was diagnosed with stage 3 breast cancer. no other history of b. c. in our families.
always better to know than remain in ignorance. she can always get bc advice if brca gene testing ispositive.
what's the best diagnosis for tsh 0. 01 t3 (liothyronine) 12. 9 and t4 292? no previous problems with thyroid but have had breast cancer
you have hyperthyroidism which may have been partially caused by radiation to the chest for treatment of your breast cancer. you should undergo a thyroid ultrasound and be checked for thyroid antibodies. after verifying your thyroid results you should be treated with methimazole to slow down your thyroid.
what's the best diagnosis for tsh 0. 01 t3 (liothyronine) 12. 9 and t4 292? no previous problems with thyroid but have had breast cancer
this sounds like a classic hyperthyroidism (overactive thyroid). most commonly caused by autoimmune syndromes such as grave's disease or thyroiditis hyperthyroidism always requires evaluation treatment and monitoring. your family doctor should be able to walk you through this process and may consult an endocrinologist along the way.
what's the best diagnosis for tsh 0. 01 t3 (liothyronine) 12. 9 and t4 292? no previous problems with thyroid but have had breast cancer
tsh is the most sensitive test of thyroid function. low tsh indicates thyroid hormone excess. an endocrinologist is best for treatment. p. s. are you sure t4 was 292 and not 29. 2?
what are the latest treatments on triple negative breast cancer?
triple negative implies the absence of estrogen and progesterone receptors as well as the absence of overexpression of the her-2 gene. because of this endocrine manipulation (tamoxifen arimidex etc. doesn't work nor does herceptin (trastuzumab). in addition to surgery (and sometimes radiotherapy) most triple negative patients receive combination chemotherapy.
what are the latest treatments on triple negative breast cancer?
triple negative breast cancer accounts for approx. 15% of all breast cancer but up to 25 or 30% in young african-american women. it is a more aggressive cancer type and also more difficult to treat because of the lack of options (no hormonal therapy or herceptin (trastuzumab) or lapatinib). therefore the main treatments are surgery and chemotherapy plus/minus radiation.
what are the latest treatments on triple negative breast cancer?
the most exciting new drugs for triple negative breast cancers are called parp inhibitors. these are very effective for patients who have a brca mutation as a cause of their breast cancer. platinum drugs (carboplatin cisplatin) have also been shown to be very effective in triple negative tumors. research in this area is thriving so more treatments are on the horizon!
what are the latest treatments on triple negative breast cancer?
tnbc are considered aggressive tumors and thereby need aggressive management. they are driven by brca mutation in lot of pts. adjuvant chemo using doublets is recommended and incorporating platinum salts can be beneficial. parp inhibitors look promising but data is missing to support a broader use. careful planning needs to take place in adjuvant setting regd surgery and radiation in these pts.
what are the latest treatments on triple negative breast cancer?
local regional therapies (surg & rad) are the same for triple neg. most all triple neg will get chemo. some are very responsive which suggests a better prognosis. neoadjuvant chemo identifies these (pcr). current guidelines recommend brca testing for triple neg
what are the latest treatments on triple negative breast cancer?
latest treatments are few and far between but much research is being done and a patient could look into the new investigative trials especially if their tnbc has spread. right now we need to get the word out about the 15% of women who get this type of breast cancer. it is aggressive even at the earliest stages. it affects younger women-mammos/ultrasounds often look "benign" in the early stages. bx.
what are statistical odds for cancer returning in a 63 yr old woman 20 yrs after treatment for stage 1 breast cancer (lumpectomy chemo & radiation)?
congratulations on being a 20-yr survivor! it is impossible to give you a number or even a range without knowing more specifics about your cancer however the fact that it hasn't returned in 20 years certainly puts you in favorable statistical category. i suggest that you meet with your medical oncologist to discuss this as well as any measures you can take to prevent a recurrence.
what are statistical odds for cancer returning in a 63 yr old woman 20 yrs after treatment for stage 1 breast cancer (lumpectomy chemo & radiation)?
sounds that you have been truly blessed with your life and the chance is very low for the cancer to return but not impossible. sometimes a different breast cancer could develop even the kind could change it's characteristics; like hormone status. typically that would have happened sooner. the incidence of breast cancer in a woman goes up as she ages. you need to keep your ck ups exams. good luck.
what are the current breast reconstruction techniques after breast cancer surgery?
basically - you can use your own tissue or reconstruct with a breast implant. there are several options when your own tissue is used including tram (uses the rectus muscle in the abdomen with attached skin and fat) latissimus (the muscle going from shoulder to back - usually for relatively small defects) diep (uses skin and fat on abdomen but preserves the muscle).
what are the current breast reconstruction techniques after breast cancer surgery?
implants either silicone or saline; tissue such as abdominal fat moved to breast area [diep flap] abdominal flap with a little muscle [tram] ; back muscle and tissue [lat dorsi flap] with or without an implant also; and other areas that can be moved such as fat from buttocks [free gluteal flap]. find a plastic surgeon to discuss your personal options which can vary pt to pt.
what are the current breast reconstruction techniques after breast cancer surgery?
current research suggests that women are happier with the results of reconstruction when they use their own body tissue for reconstruction. women who choose implants must realize that in about 10-12 years they may need to be redone. also the fda has provisionally appoved implants. they are neither proven safe or unsafe at this time. post approval studies are ordered by the fda- compliance is lacking.
what are the current breast reconstruction techniques after breast cancer surgery?
the good news is you have more and better options now than ever before. the most common procedures involve some use of implants your own tissue (from the back or the abdomen) or a combination of both. a long and thorough discussion of your goals desires and fears with your surgeon along with analysis of your specific anatomy will help you arrive at the best choice for you.
what are the current breast reconstruction techniques after breast cancer surgery?
this is a complex matter and can be achieved without any surgery minimal reconstruction with rearrangement of locat tissues back fat and muscle with or without implants your abdominal/buttock/thigh skin and fat and most recently the use of injected fat.
what are the current breast reconstruction techniques after breast cancer surgery?
options for breast reconstruction following mastectomy are: 1) tissue expanders followed by implants 2) tissue flap reconstruction including tram diep flap and other flaps 3) combination of flap and implant (latissimus + implant) and 4) prosthesis -- meaning no reconstruction and wearing a prosthesis. there are advantages and disadvantages to each type. have a discussion with your surgeon.
what are the current breast reconstruction techniques after breast cancer surgery?
this question has alot of factors. your general health the extent of your breast cancer if you are receiving radiation chemotherapy etc. studies show that women seem to prefer reconstruction that is done with their own bodyfat and skin transferred; but fewer plastic surgeons are avail. some women have a saline expander placed at the time of mastectomy under their chest muscle; swapped out later.
what are the current breast reconstruction techniques after breast cancer surgery?
2 main categories: breast implants or tissue. reconstruction with implants is typically performed in stages. the first stage uses a spacer (tissue expander) to create/modify the overall breast shape. this is replaced by the final implant later. tissue techniques involve moving tissue from another part of the body. there are several options. many of these procedures involve microsurgery.
what are the current breast reconstruction techniques after breast cancer surgery?
currently there are two major categories for breast reconstruction: implants (saline or silicone) and autologous (your own) tissue. traditionally implant reconstruction begins with a tissue expander that gets replaced. autologous techniques include pedicled transfers (i. e. tram or ld) vs free (free tram diep etc. ). inquire which technique is suited for you.
what are the current breast reconstruction techniques after breast cancer surgery?
breast reconstruction can be performed with various skin and/or muscle flaps from the back abdomen or buttock. alternatively a temporary implant can be placed beneath the muscle of the breast and used to stretch the skin. after there is enough skin a permanent breast implant can be placed. a plastic surgeon who is well versed in these techniques is your best resource.
why is it necessary to do a mammogram?
it is not necessary to get a mammogram. a mammogram is a screening test for breast cancer and considered preventive medicine. 1 in 8 women will get breast cancer including those with strong family history of (maternal side) breast cancer. since finding breast cancer in the early stages increases the cure rate it is to a woman's advantage to get screened.
why is it necessary to do a mammogram?
breast cancer will affect 1 in 8 women! the american college or radiology recommends yearly screening mammograms begin at age 40 or 10 years earlier than the diagnosis of a primary relative (sister/mother). in addition because not all cancers can be seen on mammogram women should do monthly self-exams as well as periodic exams by a breast health professional.
why is it necessary to do a mammogram?
screening mammography is performed to detect early breast cancers when they are potentially most curable. mammography screening programs have been shown to reduce breast cancer mortality. most organizations recommend starting screening at age 40.
what should i look out for on a day to day basis to ensure that i don't develop breast cancer?
no one knows for sure what lifestyle activities decrease a woman's risk of breast cancer. but regular exercise and avoiding alcohol seem to help. regular exercise means doing about 30 minutes a day 5 days a week of moderate-intensity activity like brisk walking running cycling swimming or dancing.
what should i look out for on a day to day basis to ensure that i don't develop breast cancer?
i agree with drs. greenhut and harris with respect to the benefit of a healthy lifestyle and performing self-examination. the only point i would add is the importance and underutilization of mammography. all women should begin getting mammograms at age 40 and yearly thereafter. diagnosing breast cancer before it becomes palpable leads to the highest cure rates.
what should i look out for on a day to day basis to ensure that i don't develop breast cancer?
there are subtle changes that occur in the breasts with breast cancer. checking daily will not help pick these up. examining your breast monthly about the same time in your cycle is the best way to find changes in your breasts that may be significant. i usually tell patients that "lumpy oatmeal" feeling is normal but peas and marbles aren't.
what information do i have to bring along to do the mammogram?
age at first period use contraceptives pregnancy history and use of hormones. if there are family members who have had breast cancer. also any personal history of breast cancer or other malignancy history of recent breast trauma or breast intervention.
what do you recommend for paget's disease of breast?
paget's disease is defined as cancer cells within the skin of the nipple. it is associated with an underlying cancer somewhere in the breast 95%of the time. surgical rx requires removal of the nipple-areolar complex and the cancer (if present); while not mandatory this often requires a mastectomy to accomplish both. the prognosis is similar to any other breast cancer based on its stage.
what do you recommend for paget's disease of breast?
paget's disease of the breast is one of the ways breast cancer can manifest. it is usually due to breast cancer in the nipple/areolar area. it may be confused with dermatitis or eczema. if there is any suspicion for paget's disease of the breast diagnostic imaging of the breast need to be done as a general work up. then followed by a biopsy even if the mammogram and ultrasound studies are negative.
will paget's disease of breast kill me?
possible because paget's disease of the breast is associated with an underlying breast cancer (in situ and/or invasive) in almost 90% of cases often without an associated breast mass or mammographic abnormality. the prognosis will depend on the underlying beast cancer.
what are the most common symptoms of gynecomastia?
adolescent/teenager males often have this enlargement of breast tissues secondary to hormonal surge of puberty etc. . it is quite common and require no treatment or something simple i. e. ibuprofen for soreness etc. for older males this maybe of more concerns. some are caused by medications but just remember men get breast cancers too--just much less than females. consult your doc. good luck.
what can i do to comfort my mom as she is treated for breast cancer?
go to this site and click on "patient resources".
what can i do to comfort my mom as she is treated for breast cancer?
depending on what treatment she's receiving & what side effects she's having the best help will vary. ask her - maybe a favorite dish will help with nausea; maybe a crochet hat will help keep her head warm & hide hair loss; maybe she'll just want to hang out & talk whatever she needs she's fortunate to have you around to help.
what can i do to comfort my mom as she is treated for breast cancer?
by asking the question you are well on your way. listen to her be there love her. recognize and validate her emotions on this journey-they may be different than you expect or might have ourself. be sure you ask for her perspective before assuming yours. know what he wants and epcts from her providers an treatment. offer to be involved in visits or hospital stays. good luck to you both and sorry.
what can i do to comfort my mom as she is treated for breast cancer?
keep calm. just be there for her and listen to her. keep your positive attitude. try to get more information about her treatment so you can anticipate problem / side effect. you can go to cancer. gov or nccn. org. sometimes when on chemo people could become forgetful. you can be there for her to remind her. just try to be a bit more sensitive and be supportive.
what's a natural way to treat metastatic breast cancer?
my sympathies for your condition. there is nothing in the medicine cabinet of natural medicine for metastatic breast cancer. a variety of agents are helpful in this condition which your oncologist can help you with.
what's a natural way to treat metastatic breast cancer?
i do not know of any effective "natural" treatments for breast cancer. letting nature take its course will lead to the death of the patient. conventional treatments do not cure metastatic breast cancer but may prolong life and make the patient more comfortable.
what are the odds of a 97 year old having breast cancer?
the median age of breast cancer in female in us is about 67 years. that means the further you are away from the median the lesser is the chance. but it's still a possibility. i would not recommend routine mammogram in this age group. just use common sense and if one finds a lump that's new then medical attention should be sought.
what are the odds of a 97 year old having breast cancer?
there is no upper age limit for any cancer.
why do we give antiestrogen drugs to those who have breast cancer?
some breast cancer need estrogen to grow and their growth can be retarded by anti-estrogenic drugs.
why do we give antiestrogen drugs to those who have breast cancer?
receptors: are not on all tumors and are checked for estrogen (er); progesterone (pr) and now her-2-neu. if er and pr + anti-estrogens are of some benefit. they cause tumor cells to stop dividing and tumors to shrink. they are variable in ductal cancers but very commonly positive in lobular carcinoma.
what are some early signs and symptoms of breast cancer?
most breast cancers are picked up on routine mammography in asymptomatic women. others have lumps pain discharge skin rash at nipple axillary lumps (lymph nodes). strong family hx important.
what are some early signs and symptoms of breast cancer?
the earliest signs of breast cancer are found on screening mammograms where we may detect a cancer before it becomes palpable. careful physical examination may find cancers either by self-exam or physician-exam. symptoms include a new lump nipple discharge breast pain skin changes and/or nipple inversion.
what are some early signs and symptoms of breast cancer?
a lump in the breast is the usual early sign/symptom. in uncommon cases a rash on and near the nipple retraction of the nipple redness and swelling of the breast mass in the armpit may be the first manifestation. rarely distant spread of the tumor especially to the bone may be the first sign.
what age is mammogram no longer needed?
mammography yearly is advised for all women over 40 or 50yrs. breast cancer can occur at any age.
will a woman who took the original bc pills have higher risk of breast cancer?
the "original" birth control pills introduced in the 1960's had a much higher level of hormones compared to modern pills introduced in the 1980's. the older pills might increase the risk of developing breast cancer but newer versions have not been shown to significantly increase risk. a decision to take any hormone medication should be made with your physician taking into account your history.
will a woman who took the original bc pills have higher risk of breast cancer?
many studies have been published trying to make a connection between bcp use and breast cancer. the two largest studies showed contradictory results with one noting a slightly increased risk and the other none. in the former the risk seemed to go away after 10 years off bcps. for more information check the following: <link>
why did they tell us the old bc pills didn't cause breast cancer? so many of my classmates have died since 1965
it is very difficult to evaluate any drug's long-term cancer risk due to the number of years it may take to determine this. every drug has side effects and one must balance the desired effects with potential risks both known and unknown. the data re: bcps and breast cancer risk is contradictory based on studies to-date: <link>
why did they tell us the old bc pills didn't cause breast cancer? so many of my classmates have died since 1965
tell you that estrogen containing birth control pills caused cancer because they do not. there may be weak evidence of association with life-long estrogen onslaught being a risk (pregnancy continuously interrupts this) but the association is likely in promoting a cancer already establishes and responsive to the hormone. few would attribute bcp's to benefit the decreasing mortality since 1963.
what age was the youngest male with breast cancer recorded?
but to qualify it was a breast sarcoma (connective tissue type cancer ) not a breast cancer as you would think of infiltrating breast cancer- not otherwise specified usually occurs in the older population>60 my youngest 40 but he had the breast cancer gene brca 2. but at the cancer hospital you select out for the unusual.
what age was the youngest male with breast cancer recorded?
there are several syndromes that are associated with breast cancer development and so children <1 year of age can develop breast cancer (male or female). however this is exceedingly uncommon.
why do i need mammogram and a breast ultrasound?
mammograms use x-ray technique and are better at detecting tiny calcium deposits that may signal an early breast cancer than ultrasound. mammograms can also detect tumors. ultrasound uses soundwaves like sonar and will help determine if a lump is solid (requiring biopsy) or a cyst (fluid filled & usually not cancer). both tests work together to find breast cancer.
what if adult men develop gynecomastia? what do you treat it with?
first visit your doctor to make sure that the breast swelling isn't actually breast cancer. this is rare in males but shouldn't be overlooked. then if it really is just gynecomastia it usually goes away within 6-8 weeks if you avoid all touching and unnecessary pressure to the breast area. if it doesn't go away you may need an operation to remove some of the extra breast tissue.
what is the prognosis for triple negative breast cancer?
all else being equal women with triple negative breast cancer have a worse prognosis than those who are receptor-positive; however prognosis is highly correlated with the size of the cancer and the presence of cancer within the axillary lymph nodes. furthermore some women are more responsive to chemo than others which will affect prognosis.
what is the prognosis for triple negative breast cancer?
this depends on the stage of the cancer and the overall health of the patient.
what is the prognosis for triple negative breast cancer?
that very much depends on the stage at diagnosis and the treatment; these days most women with triple negative breast cancer receive neoadjuvant chemotherapy prior to their surgery and much is learned from their response to the treatment they receive prior to their surgery .
what are some early signs and symptoms of breast cancer (besides a lump)?
aside from a lump there are very few signs and symptoms of early breast cancer. when the cancer has reached a considerable size it can cause skin changes (such as dimpling thickening) bloody/clear discharge and/or pain. by leaps and bounds the earliest sign of a breast cancer is an abnormality found on routine screening mammography. mammograms save lives!
what are some early signs and symptoms of breast cancer (besides a lump)?
lump is usually the earliest sign/symptom. less commonly a discharge from the nipple an eczema like rash on the nipple and areola redness and swelling of the skin over the breast a lump in the axilla may be the first indication.
what are some early signs and symptoms of breast cancer (besides a lump)?
retraction of skin or nipple - dimpling small lump - bb shot and larger nipple discharge late changes is redness edema larger mass change in contour i only wish pain was a symptom or early symptom but not that is usually fcd.
who gets money from heart/breast cancer walks?
very good question and one you should be asking the organizations. the questions to ask: how much of every dollar collected is for overhead for patient related literature produced for designated research facilities [and which ones and is it a grant that is restricted to breast cancer research or not]. do your research some 'charities' are supporting themselves.
who gets money from heart/breast cancer walks?
sponsored by the american heart association; the race (not walk) for the cure is a susan g komen foundation activity. i do not know what aha does with their money; komen sponsors many women's activities and some research but has its own board decide how to disburse collections.
whats an aide to detect breast cancer in its earlier stages?
quite often the results of noninvasive examination mammography and additional tests performed in special circumstances like ultrasound or mri are enough to perform excisional biopsy as the definitive diagnostic and curative method. biopsy in these cases would get the entire cancer which can be studied under a microscope.
whats an aide to detect breast cancer in its earlier stages?
the triumvirate of screening is breast self exam annual clinical breast exam and annual screening mammography after age 40. for high risk patients (i. e. family history prior findings of atypic etc) more intensive screening with more frequent clinical surveillance including being followed by a breast specialist/surgeon and other imaging (i. e. mri) may be indicated.
whats an aide to detect breast cancer in its earlier stages?
proper screening with self breast exams looking for new lumps breast exams by your physician looking for skin or nipple chanes as well as masses or lymph nodes and mammogram and ultrasound if needed are the best ways to pick up early stage breast cancer before it causes any symptoms. once advanced it can cause many different symptoms throughout the body.
what kind of mutation is present in the brca1 gene in the breast cancer families?
brca 1 and 2 genes encode proteins than normally repair our dna. when the genes are mutated the protein they normally make does not work correctly leading to loss of the ability to fix other dna mutaions and development of tumors.
what kind of mutation is present in the brca1 gene in the breast cancer families?
the brca-1 mutations account for around 5% of breast cancers. this maps to chromosome 17q21 and may be a transcription factor.
what is estrogen receptor positive breast cancer?
these are tumors with estrogen receptors on them. this makes them susceptable to some chemotherapeutic agents like tamoxifen.
what is estrogen receptor positive breast cancer?
normal breast cells have estrogen receptors which are like locks that estrogen "keys" fit into. many breast cancer cells also have these estrogen receptors which is good for 2 reasons: (1)these cancers tend to be less aggressive (since they resemble normal breast cells) and; (2)"anti-estrogens" such as tamoxifen can be very effective chemotherapeutic agents for these cancers.
whats cause and effect of brca1 gene on breast cancer?
genetic mutation in long arm of chromosome 17 in brca 1 in 13 brca 2 instead of normal protective proteins which control abnormal growth of cell repair broken down dna maintain genetic stability the abnormal proteins fail to protect and responsible for 40% inherited breast cancers 80% of breast & ovarian cancers.
whats cause and effect of brca1 gene on breast cancer?
brca1 is a large protein involved in repairing dna damage. deficiency in this protein due to mutation of brca1 gene leads to defective repair of damage to dna that leads to uncontrolled proliferation of cells and cancer.
what are the treatments for invasive ductal carcinoma in situ?
these terms are incongruous: dcis is by definition breast cancer that has not "broken out" of the ducts and entered the adjacent supportive tissue of the breast; invasive or infiltrating ductal cancer by definition has. the treatment of these 2 diseases is quite different since there is a risk of systemic disease with the latter. please clarify thanks.

we just need more information here. if there was loss of consciousness passing out seizure disorder is one cause. low blood pressure is another. a heart irregularity is a third. too often we do not find the cause for an episode of so called syncope. ask the doctors to find out what they discover.
why would a woman need breast implant removal?
apart from implant related problems occasionally women don't want to be subject to maintaining a medical device which has a finite "shelf life". occasionally having implants doesn't fit their aesthetic sense as menopause occasionally increases the volume of natural tissue and cup size enlarges. infrequently implants are removed during breast cancer surgery.

what percentage of women who have lumps in their breasts are diagnosed with breast cancer after being scanned?
a lump in the breast is the most common presenting sign of breast cancer so one must never assume it's benign without working it up. that said often they are benign. btw while scans and radiological procedures are very useful in working up breast cancers a lump which can be felt needs to be biopsied regardless of a normal mammogram.
what percentage of women who have lumps in their breasts are diagnosed with breast cancer after being scanned?
x-ray mammograms are falsely postive 5-15% of the time which means that a a "suspicious mammo is quiet likely to be cancer but ultrasounds are commonly used to help define characteristis and biopsy. mri is used in woman with brca 1&2 and "dense breasts". when used indiscriminately the false positive may be greater than 30%.

why does breast cancer get more publicity? is it the numbers or the komen foundation?
tragic losses. there is "innocence" unlike lung cancer where society levels blame on the victim because "they smoked" - no one smokes to get cancer but there are an amazing # of question about "how safe is it to smoke for 3 years or 3 cigarettes a day. lung cancer kills more women than breast cancer yet gets about 10 times the funding and interest.
why does breast cancer get more publicity? is it the numbers or the komen foundation?
komen was one of the 1st organizations to help draw attention to breast cancer and bring it out of the shadows. organizations like komen and avon have funded a large portion of the research and community activities in the country. women are vocal about issues near and dear to them. other conditions can get publicity it takes a person to champion the cause and other to follow.
what is the best alternative treatment for someone with metastatic breast cancer?
i encourage you to ask your doctor and alternative providers to work together. there are no guaranteed "cures" with either alternative or western medicine. however therapies can complement each other or they can counteract each other. you don't want that! some diets may inhibit cancer growth and side effects may be relieved with alternative medicine. be open and honest with all your docs!
what is the best alternative treatment for someone with metastatic breast cancer?
if the cancer is subject to hormonal manipulation or to the new biologicals go with these. if mainstream treatment options have clearly run out resist the temptation to reward a sweet-taking "natural healing" or dark "conspiracy" talker with money for rx's that won't work. ("they failed because you ate gmo food. ") get with hospice -- palliative care is good nowadays. best wishes.
what is the best alternative treatment for someone with metastatic breast cancer?
i am not sure what you mean by "alternative" but many of our current treatments-chemotherapy and hormonal therapy are good for treating breast cancer. there are complimentary treatments (acupuncture reiki to name a few) that can be used along with standard therapy but should never be used solely "to cure cancer" these have not gone through the rigorous fda standards.

what are my chances of getting breast cancer if no one in my family has it?
the gail model which is available on the nci website is a good way to assess "relative" risk but will not tell you if someone is going to get breast cancer. the majority of patients diagnosed don't have a family history. the number one risk factor is being female and having breast tissue. this is the reason for population screening via bse cbe & mammography.
what are my chances of getting breast cancer if no one in my family has it?
if you google the gale model you can input your age number of pregnancies family history etc. and it will give you the percent chance of you having breast cancer in the next 5 years and your lifetime risk of breast cancer.

would metastatic cervical cancer in the breast appear the same as breast cancer on mammogram and ultrasound?
cervical cancer (the tissue at the end of the vaginal canal) rarely metastasizes to the breast. rather breast cancer may metastasize to many areas of body such as bone lung brain lymph nodes. that being said any abnormal growth in the breast though mostly breast tissue could look similarly by mammogram or ultrasound. the bottom line is if there is an abnormality must be biopsied.
would metastatic cervical cancer in the breast appear the same as breast cancer on mammogram and ultrasound?
while it would be highly unlikely for cervix cancer to spread to the breast if it did plain mammography would likely not differentiate the two processes.
would metastatic cervical cancer in the breast appear the same as breast cancer on mammogram and ultrasound?
it would be unlikely that cervical cancer would metastasize to the breast. while rare metastasis to the breast have slightly different characteristics on mammogram and ultrasound from primary breast cancers but they can look similar enough that a biopsy would be needed.
what is the best method of detecting breast cancer early?
screening mammography has been proven to find cancers well before they become palpable (and save lives). mri is even more sensitive than a mammogram but is cost-prohibitive; in the right setting it can be very effective. self-examination is a bit less beneficial but if done regularly it can identify cancers that may otherwise be missed on mammography.
what is the best method of detecting breast cancer early?
breast self exams can easily be done by women monthly. mammograms can be done annually for women 40 years of age and older.
what is hereditary breast cancer called?
hereditary mutations in either brca-1 or brca-2 genes predispose carriers to developing breast cancers usually at an early age. other cancers like ovarian cancer can also occur commonly even in the same patient.
what is hereditary breast cancer called?
hboc=hereditary breast and ovarian cancer which is due to a mutation in the brca1 or 2 gene. there are other inherited cancer syndromes that increase the risk of breast cancer. these include cowden's li-fraumeni lynch peutz-jeghers and hereditary diffuse gastric cancer syndrome. but 85% of breast cancer just happens unrelated to any of these inherited syndromes.
what is hereditary breast cancer called?
about 3% of the breast cancers are due to inherited anomalies. these are due to many different dna changes. the more commonly known breast cancer genes are brca 1 and brca 2.
will i still have feeling in my breast after breast cancer surgery?
if you have a lumpectomy you still will have feeling in your breast. if a lot of tissue is removed from the area behind the nipple and areola you may loose some (or all) sensation of the nipple. if you have a mastectomy you will have numbness of the skin adjacent to the incision where they made the skin flaps to remove the breast.
will i still have feeling in my breast after breast cancer surgery?
this depends on the type of surgery that is performed. if the entire breast is removed (mastectomy) there will be minimal feeling. with a lumpectomy generally feeling returns once everything heals.
will i still have feeling in my breast after breast cancer surgery?
if it is a lumpectomy usually - although you may have areas of numbness or tenderness.

there may be some numbness but usually it is not an issue following breast surgery.
what is the success rate of a patient taking gemzar (gemcitabine) for metastatic breast cancer?
the success of gemcitabine (or other chemotherapy) depends on several factors. where the cancer is what prior treatments have been administered and if anything in addition to gemcitabine is being administered. gemcitabine is effective in about 1/3 of patients treated if it is the first drug administered for metastatic breast cancer. these chances decline if it is the 2nd 3rd or later treatment.
what are the side effects of breast reconstruction?
there are many different techniques of breast reconstruction. simply put reconstruction following mastectomy for breast cancer can be a very positive procedure for women facing breast cancer treatment. reconstruction involves stages can begin immediately or later after mastectomy and involves the use of implants or of body tissue or both. side effects are similar to most surgeries.
what is "early-stage" breast cancer?
"early stage" means it was detected early. that generally means a relatively small (amenable to lumpectomy/breast conservation) with no or minimal lymph node involvement. the earlier a cancer is detected the more options for treatment and the better the prognosis.
what is "early-stage" breast cancer?
the breast is composed of glands that can produce milk (lobules) tubes that transport the milk to the nipple (ducts) and fatty tissue. cancer may begin in the lobules or ducts. if it is only found inside these structures the stage is 0 (zero). if it grows out of the lobules or ducts into the fatty tissue but is not in the lymph nodes it is stage 1 (one).
what is hereditary breast cancer risk?
risks brca 1 & 2 are known other are not but familial clusters (mother aunt sister) point to risk but the actual cause and function of the genetics are mysterious. we humans have a hard time with "risk". some with no risk delvelop a cancer; others with high risk do not. the statistical facts work epidemiologicallyfor populations but are not informative for an individual. they do cause worr.
what is survival rate with invasive ductal carcinoma of breast?
breast cancers are staged based upon the size of the cancer lymph node or distant organ involvement direct extension to the skin or chest wall muscles and unique molecular features of the tumor. published rates of 5-yr survival (<link> cancer. org/cancer/breastcancer/detailedguide/breast-cancer-survival-by-stage) vary quite a bit based on these variables between 15%-93%.
what are the psych effects of having a mastectomy?
for women this may be the most important and difficult issue to contend with beside the implications of a diagnosis of cancer. having treated hundreds of unfortunate women with a breast cancer diagnosis over the last 25 years i can emphatically state that i am amazed at the resilience strength and heart of my patients to undergo the procedure and then the different stages of reconstruction.
what is a sentinel node biopsy?
lymph nodes are biopsied to see if cancer has spread beyond the primary site. using a radioactive tracer and dye the lymph nodes closest to a tumor can be identified and biopsied without having to remove all the potential draining nodes which can lead to complications. most often done with breast cancer and melanoma.
who has info on the relation between in vitro fertilization treatment medications and breast cancer?
to my knowledge there is ongoing research to figure out the potential impact of fertility treatment-hormonal-on the development of breast cancer. there is some indication that "many attempts" at in vitro fertilization many somewhat increase a woman's risk of breast cancer. because we do not have a precise way of predicting a woman's risk it is a question to ask your fertility specialist. luck.
who has info on the relation between in vitro fertilization treatment medications and breast cancer?
repeated use of ivf medications without success (i. e. without pregnancy) can stimulate tumorigenesis on the breast tissue especially in genetically predisposed women. on the other hand if ivf results in the desired outcome (pregnancy) the risk of breast cancer will decrease because of the protective effect of placental progesterone.
why do doctors after giving the pellets for testoterone give a small pill that women use for breast cancer saying to fight the oestrogen from testo?
testosterone can be metabolised to estradiol by the enzyme aromatase. aromatase inhibitor will inhibit aromatase enzyme and as the result will prevent the conversion to estrodiol which is female hormone. that also will enhance potency of the testosterone.
why do doctors after giving the pellets for testoterone give a small pill that women use for breast cancer saying to fight the oestrogen from testo?
to prevent man gynecomastia (man boobs). testosterone and estrogen are almost identical. it takes very little effort for your body to convert testosterone into estrogen. blocking the conversion of testosterone can help prevent gynecomastia. not every patient will need that pill. your doctor will probably want to check your hormone levels.
what is this bloody nipple discharge?
bloody nipple discharge has many causes ranging from benign and malignant lesions infection inflammation and trauma. the most common cause is a growth within a duct which is called an intraductal papilloma. this is usually a benign tumor. however breast cancer can also cause nipple discharge which may be bloody or even clear. so it definitely needs an expert evaluation.
what do surgeons need before performing preventative simple mastectomy?
before considering a prophylactic mastectomy it is necessary to understand one's risk of developing breast cancer. this is best addressed by a genetic counselor supplemented by blood testing. next it is important to understand the different surgical options available especially relating to simultaneous reconstruction. lastly a recent mammogram is necessary to check for an occult cancer.
why do they treat some woman with breast cancer with herceptin (trastuzumab)?
about 1/4 cases of breast cancer express a protein on the surface of the cancer cells called her2neu which is a member of the epidermal growth factor family of receptors important for growth signaling into the cell nucleus. herceptin (trastuzumab) is an antibody developed to target her2neu and antagonize this growth signaling and kill the cancer cell. chemo is synergistic with herceptin (trastuzumab) when given together.
why do they treat some woman with breast cancer with herceptin (trastuzumab)?
expressed; some do not. it only works on those who express sufficient her-2-neu copies by fish (fluoroescent in-sit hybrization) a test done on the cancer tissue at the pathology lab.
what are some alternative treatments for evista (raloxifene)?
evista is primarily given to combat/prevent osteoporosis. alternative medications are bisphosphonates such as fosamax actonel boniva. reclast (zoledronic acid) is an injectable. evista also has a breast cancer chemo prevention indication with the alternative being tamoxifen. aroma taste inhibitors are being studied as further alternatives.
what are the effects of tamoxifen?
tam binds and blocks signals to the estrogen receptor present in er+ breast cancer. while this has benefits in cancer treatment it produces side effects - menopausal symptoms possible uterine wall thickening & even malignancy if ignored & increased risk of blood clots (similar to hormone replacement). in most cases of ca the benefits far outway the risks but must be weighed in risk reduction.
what is raloxifene for?
raloxifene (evista) along with decreasing breast cancer risk is used to treat and prevent osteoporosis.
what is the cause of a sticky nipple discharge?
reasons for nipple discharge can include stimulation of the breast pregnancy medications galactorrhea (secretion of milk or similar substance) an abscess or other breast infection hormonal imbalances (like hypothyroidism) fibrocystic breasts (breasts are very fibrous) blocked mammary duct breast cancer and intraductal papilloma (non cancerous mass) use of marijuana anise and fennel.
what are herbs for breast enlargement?
any herbal supplements possesing estrogen like properties have the potential to promote breast growth. for example marijuana is known to stimulate the growth of breasts in men. similarly. excessive intake of certain soy products may also simulate estrogen like side effects. in addition to those mentioned. however the potential for stimulating breast cancer growth and other side effects is unknown.
what constitutes a family history of breast cancer? how close must relative be?
hi medical investigators typically used the gale questionnaire re: breast cancer risk. the questions would be a first degree relative age less than 50 years old who developed breast cancer. a first degree relative with a brca 1 or 2 mutation. note:both mother and father's side. this model of familial risk for breast cancer is not as reliable as once was thought. pls seek bc genetic counselor eval.
what constitutes a family history of breast cancer? how close must relative be?
any family history is important - both maternal and paternal - but 1st degree (mothers sisters daughters) carry the most weight. the further out one gets on the tree the thinner and weaker the branches get. for risk calculations the gail model includes only 1st degree relatives the claus model includes 1st and 2nd degree.
what's the difference between mammogram and ultrasound for breast cancer detection?
a mammogram is an excellent screening test designed to find cancers before they are palpable. an ultrasound is best utilized for determining the severity of what was seen on mammography. using the info from both studies we can then decide if biopsy is necessary. ultrasound is also a tool to supplement physical exams--it's like a stethoscope for breast surgeons.
what's the difference between mammogram and ultrasound for breast cancer detection?
across the board screening mammography detects approx. 3-5 cancers per 1000 patients. some studies show that screening ultrasound can detect an additional 2-3 cancers per 1000 and is particularly particularly useful in dense breasts where the sensitivity of mammo for detecting cancers drops from 80% overall to less than 50%. they are complementary tests and the role of us is currently evolvin
what's the difference between mammogram and ultrasound for breast cancer detection?
mammograms use x-rays to evaluate the breast. they look for abnormal deposits of calcium that can be a sign of breast cancer. ultrasound is used for lumps for which the significance is uncertain. ultrasound can tell the difference between fluid filled cysts (that are benign) and solid masses that should be biopsied. this is especially useful in younger women where cysts are common.
what are the pros and cons of getting the brca breast genetic test if you are just curious about your risks?
pros including knowing your risks and developing possible prevention strategies to reduce that risk. also testing can inform about risks for other cancers like ovarian cancer and breast cancer in men. the cons are that the test is expensive and often not covered by insurance if you dont meet criteria. you have to be sure you want to know the risk as it can also impact your mental health
what are the pros and cons of getting the brca breast genetic test if you are just curious about your risks?
most breast cancer (85%) has nothing to do with the brca gene. so if you test negative you may have a false sense of safety. if you test positive you will have to consider having your breasts and ovaries removed. the risk of a mutation in brca1 is ~1 in 300 and for brca2 it's ~1 in 800. this is not a general screening test. talk to a genetic counselor to really understand the pros and cons!
what are signs of breastcancer besides lumps? is pain a common sign?

what percentage of women survive having breast cancer twice?
one significant risk factor for breast cancer is a history of prior breast cancer. considering our high cure rates for early breast cancer this scenario is not uncommon. if they are 2 independent cancers the chance for cure is stage-dependent just like any other woman with breast cancer. if it occurs in the opposite breast some women are more inclined to choose double mastectomy to avoid a 3rd.
what percentage of women survive having breast cancer twice?
know the percent i have three women under treatment with that scenario. it is not usual but it is not shocking when it occurs. may be more common with lobular carcinoma (which makes up about 15% of breast cancer). it can be presaged by lobular neoplasia which is associated with bilateral breast cancer.
what is the average survival rate for breast cancer?
breast cancers vary a lot from one person to the next. features that help predict how aggressive any cancer is include it's size the presence of spread to adj. lymph nodes or distant organs specific proteins that are found on some cancers (estrogen- progesterone- her2/neu receptors) the grade of the tumor the type of breast cancer etc. in general when caught early we have high cure rates.
what is the average survival rate for breast cancer?
it depends on the stage the biology and whether you receive the optimal therapy for particular type of cancer that you have. for instance for her 2+ disease-for the same stage of cancer- your survival will be better if you receive herceptin (trastuzumab)/her 2 inhibitor in addition to chemo as opposed to if you do not receive herceptin (trastuzumab). discuss with your oncologist in detail.
what could breast lump that does not show on a mammogram or a sonagram be?
usually if mammo and ultrasound are normal it turns out to be nothing of concern. however a small percentage of breast cancers are found only on physical exam so depending on the physical findings and your doctors level of suspicion further evaluation may be needed.

what do you mean by natural? non-surgical? mechanical? weight gain? bio-identical hormones? garments? vacuum devices? duct tape? "chicken-cutlets"? pads? exercises? few of these provide sustained desirable results. hormones may stimulate early breast cancers. expanders may increase breast by vacuum. fat injections are another natural method. see <link>
what are the negatives of breast implants?
breast implants are imperfect devices. they may settle unevenly too high or too low. they may get infected (rare). they do not last forever and the scar around them may harden with time. radiologists say they make mammograms harder to read though no study has shown women with implants do any worse if they get breast cancer. most who choose to get implants want new ones if the old ones wear out.

are defined as breast cancer cells in the sentinel lymph node 2mm). for example recent studies show an axillary dissection is not necessary when the sentinel node shows micrometastases. your doctors will consider this when recommending chemo and maybe radiation.
what is breast cancer sentinel node micro metastases?
typically it depends on the size of the metastasis. a metastasis between 0. 2 mm. and 2 mm. is considered micrometastatic disease (stage n1mic) while a smaller metastasis is considered individual tumor cells (stage n0(i+)). your oncologist should be able to clarify this for your specific case.
what could be the cause of inverted nipples?
some women have naturally inverted nipples. if the nipples are normally everted and become inverted there is more concern. one common cause is repeated episodes of infection/inflammation (periductal mastitis) which over time causes scarring and nipple inversion. breast cancers also can result in nipple inversion/retraction. therefore it is important to have an evaluation by a breast specialist.

milk duct cancer is ductal carcinoma a type of breast cancer.
how high is the percent of women that get breast cancer are obese?
being overweight (obese being the category for the most overweight) is associated with a modest increased risk of breast cancer in postmenopausal women. it is seen mainly in women who have never had menopausal hormone therapy and probably relates to increased estrogen levels in overweight postmenopausal women. premenopausal overweight women have a reduced risk of breast cancer!
what should i do to prevent bone loss from taking arimidex (anastrozole) after breast cancer diagnosis?
consider a dexa scan to measure bone density. if your density is low a bisphosphonate type medication can be helpful. this should be a standard conversation for your medical oncologist to have with you.
what should i do to prevent bone loss from taking arimidex (anastrozole) after breast cancer diagnosis?

what are the chances a woman recovers from breast cancer if it is caught early?
most of our ladys with early breast ca will have breast conserving therapy lumpectomy and radiation. assuming no chemo is involved these ladys do very well. they will usually miss a few days work right after surgery and than work thur the radiation and be healed up about two to four weeks later. always be the potential for long term tenderness at the lumpectomy site &rare risk lymphadema.
what are the chances a woman recovers from breast cancer if it is caught early?
the chance for cure is quite high for early or even intermediate-stage breast cancer. some may require only local rx (surgery+/-radiation rx) others may need chemotherapy as well; this can take the form of a simple pill or traditional iv therapy. bottom line: no matter what the stage there is always hope. the best thing one can do to improve survival is to get yearly mammograms beginning at 40.
will soy give you breast cancer?
since certain soy products have weak estrogenic properties the claim makes an llogical scientifically unsupported claim that soy "causes" breast ca. estrogen itself may promote some breast cancers and theweaker soys potentially could do this "weakly" .
will soy give you breast cancer?
it is both sad and funny to see self-appointed "environmentalists" show off in public eating tofu sandwiches when they are campaigning for vegetarianism then flipflop and claim tofu will give you breast cancer via phytoestrogens that are supposedly ruining our health. they make money and get political clout this way. don't let them think for you.

what are the chances of men getting breast cancer?
breast cancer remains very rare in men; only 1% of cases occur in men. all else being equal men present with more advanced disease due to the lack of awareness of breast cancer and the absence of any screening studies such as mammograms. matched stage for stage survival is the same for men or women.
what are the chances of men getting breast cancer?
the incidence is only about 2%. it is not very common.

in this country breast cancer is most often detected by mammogram before any symptoms. other symptoms include a painless new lump swollen lymph nodes in the armpit dimpling in the skin of the breast a newly inverted nipple scaling or crusting of the nipple or a sore on the breast that grown and doesn't heal.
what are the first warning signs of breast cancer?
the most common symptom is the presence of a lump in the breast. other symptoms include nipple discharge nipple inversion skin indentation and breast pain. nevertheless the majority of people diagnosed with breast cancer have no symptoms whatsoever. the best way to diagnose breast cancer early is to have routine screening mammograms beginning at age 40.
what are the first warning signs of breast cancer?
proper screening with self breast exams looking for new lumps breast exams by your physician looking for skin or nipple chanes as well as masses or lymph nodes and mammogram and ultrasound if needed are the best ways to pick up early stage breast cancer before it causes any symptoms. once advanced it can cause many different symptoms throughout the body.
what are my surgery choices for intraductal papilloma?
intraductal papilloma (ip) is the most common cause of bloody nipple discharge. they are usually noncancerous but can sometimes have abnormal cells or an early breast cancer. once diagnosed on needle biopsy they are usually completely removed with surgery. since these are small a small amount of tissue can be removed so the breast is not deformed (also scar can be near nipple).

radiation therapy to the breast has not been shown to reduce your fertility. that said it is important to use birth control methods during radiation therapy to prevent pregnancy during treatment.
why does lymphedema occur in some women after breast cancer?
1) type of surgery 2) sentinel node or full axillary node dissection. 3) radiation therapy used. hope this helps.
why does lymphedema occur in some women after breast cancer?
surgery for breast cancer requires checking the lymph nodes in the armpit for cancer. dissection of the lymph nodes interrupts the lymph channels. the more interrupted the channels get the more chance for lymphedema.
why does lymphedema occur in some women after breast cancer?
after the lynph channels are injured causes this problem. it is a byproduct of the node removal. the lymph channels carry fluid that leaks from blood vessels back to the heart. when injured by surgery or radiation they don't grow back. the fluid has more difficult path to return and swelling can occur. the more of them are injured the more the chance of swelling.
why does lymphedema occur in some women after breast cancer?
surgery is the most common reason for lymphedema in the us. it happens in breast cancer patients do to removal of lymphatic tissue and scarring in that area. other contributory factors are problems with lymphatic flow that are unique to that person but are highlighted when surgery is performed and disturbs the tissues around the lymphatics or removes them completely.
why does lymphedema occur in some women after breast cancer?
the removal of lymph nodes from the axilla will cause blockage of lymphatic flow and accumulation of lymph in the arms causing lymphedema.
why does lymphedema occur in some women after breast cancer?
nodal sampling + axillary radiation are most prone but either can do this alone and sometimes it happens without either.
what is calcification and non-invasive cancer of the breast like?
on mammogram calcifications can be seen frequently. depending on their pattern and whether or not they are new they can be characterized as either benign or suspicious appearing calcifications. this is a separate topic while related to noninvasive breast cancer which in most women is managed in a similar manner to invasive disease other than no chemotherapy. this is a very large topic. acs. org.
what is calcification and non-invasive cancer of the breast like?
certain types of microscopic calcium deposits seen on mammogram can represent early stage of non-invasive breast cancer such as dcis (ductal carcinoma in situ) or lcis (lobular). lcis is not cancerous but considered pre-cancerous. non-invasive cancers treated with lumpectomy surgery & sometimes hormone & radiation treatments.
what does this mammogram result mean if dense?
"dense" breasts are normal but decrease the sensitivity of the mammo for detecting cancers. breasts are dense when there is a increase in normal fibroglandular stroma relative to breast fat. also dense breasts are an independent risk factor for developing breast cancer.
what is the genetic recurrence of breast cancer?
we believe that only 10-15% of breast cancers are hereditary with the rest being environmental in origin. people w/the hereditary form of breast cancer tend to get diagnosed earlier in life and may get cancer in both breasts. when treated by lumpectomy or (single) mastectomy it is not uncommon to develop a second unrelated breast cancer; therefore many opt for double mastectomies.
with a previous diagnosis of atypical lobular hyperplasia is it wiser to terminate a pregnancy at age 49 to avoid increase breast cancer risk?
this question is too complex to answer in this format--please see a breast surgeon to discuss. population studies note a higher risk of breast cancer just after pregnancies likely related to women who have existing (hormone-sensitive) cancers in their breast during pregnancy. also first pregnancies late in life are associated w/increase breast ca risk. how this might affect you is hard to know.
with a previous diagnosis of atypical lobular hyperplasia is it wiser to terminate a pregnancy at age 49 to avoid increase breast cancer risk?
this is a very difficult question that ultimately goes to your individual feelings about pregnancy termination. however your risk with alh is increased but not so dramatically that anyone would suggest that termination is medically neccessary.
what could cause bloody nipple discharge?
an polyp in the breast duct(papilloma) is the most common cause of bloody discharge but breast cancer should be eliminated as the cause. a mammogram and ultrasound can show the lesion. a core needle biopsy can make the diagnosis. in some cases as special mammogram with dye (ductogram or galactogram) may need to be performed.

what are your thoughts of the use of tamoxifen for refractory ovarian cancer?
probably not very beneficial. for uterine cancer there has been some data. little if any benefit in ovarian cancer. unlike breast cancer in which there is a benefit in estrogen positive disease because of the estrogen target there is no target in ovarian cancer. hope this helps.
what can be done for someone with both polio and also breast cancer?
that new polio cases have occurred anywhere in the world after the 1950's is a crime against humanity by its governments and cultists. someone weakened by polio deserves the same aggressive management of suspected or proven breast cancer as anyone else. found early and treated properly the vast majority of breast cancers are cured. good luck and thank you for asking.
what is chemo for breast cancer like?
it can be rough on some people but generally tolerable. depending on the drug regimen used some can make the hair fallout temporarily give some figure tip and toe numbness and make a person weak and immune compromised for a short while. but if your medical oncologist recommends it it is because the benefits outweighs the risks of potential side effects.
what is chemo for breast cancer like?
chemotherapy nowadays is way more tolerable than many years ago. we do have good product to prevent side effects. there are many kinds of chemo - the possible side effects will depend on the type of chemo. we use chemo both as a single agent and combination of more than one kind -depending on the treatment goal. we also have targetted therapy as well as hormonal therapy in addition to chemo.
what can be done for breast cancer besides arimidex (anastrozole)?
arimidex (anastrozole) is just one of the ways that we treat breast cancer. surgery is the mainstay for most breast cancer patients - often followed by radiation therapy. we call these local therapies because they treat the breast and surrounding areas. chemotherapy and endocrine therapy treat the whole body. arimidex (anastrozole) is one form of endocrine therapy - essentially designed to starve the tumor of estrogen.
what's the difference between radical mastectomy and elephantiasis?
mastectomy is breast surgery for breast cancer. elephantiasis is a rare condition of lymphatic disease causing severe swelling mostly affecting the leg rarely occurs in the us.
will a heart mri detect breast cancer?
the equipment used for cardiac scanning with ct used more than mri i believe is usually focused just on the heart structures. so breast evaluation during a heart scan is not likely and the equipment may not be designed to evaluate the breast tissue either.
will a heart mri detect breast cancer?
breast mri is a very sensitive test for breast cancer detection using special software and thousands of images to be effective. an mri of the heart not unlike a ct scan can serendipitously find an abnormality in the breast but since it is not specifically "looking" for breast abnormalities would be less reliable than a simple mammogram or ultrasound.
will a heart mri detect breast cancer?
mri of the breast required to look at breast tissue appropriately. see radiologyinfo. org.

start here for overview of breast cancer and treatment. this is a noncommercial site that might be updated. best wishes. <link>
what is done for breast cancer with small tumors?
treatments involve surgical lumpectomy to remove the lesion possible lymph node removal depending on size & stage if the lesion possible chemotherapy or hormone therapy possible radiation therapy. need a good medical oncologist to help coordinate the best treatments.
what is done for breast cancer with small tumors?
several factors are important: grade of the tumor estrogen receptor status her2 neu status. if er+ her2 - grade 1 hormone therapy alone. if er- her2- then would possibly require chemotherapy. if er + her2+ may require chemotherapy herceptin (trastuzumab) and hormone therapy. also would depend on what surgery is performed. this requires a sit down discussion. hope this helps.
what are the odds of a breast cancer recurrence?
tumor factors - based on tnm staging receptor status grade etc treatment factors - optimal therapy vs. not patient factors - genetic predisposition - this is rarely the issue time factor - longer the time lapse since initial therapy lesser the odds.
what are the odds of a breast cancer recurrence?
depends on the stage of the cancer. in general - the node status is most important (assuming that you mean cancer that has not already metastasized). more positive nodes = more likely recurrence. size of the tumor is important. tumors that do not have estrogen receptor those with a high proliferative index (ki-67) and those with her-2-neu markers all have higher recurrence rates.
what does it mean when your nipples bleed? i am a 54 female.
you must see your obgyn asap. it can be one of the symptoms of breast cancer. there can be a few benign things as well. but any blood stained nipple discharge needs to be evaluated asap.
what is the stage of my breast cancer the lump was 4 cm and out of 11 lymp nodes 9 are positive?
tumor greater than 2 cm but less than 5 cm is a t2. 4-9 lymph nodes positive makes it n2. hope this helps. your oncologist should explain this in detail for you.
what is the stage of my breast cancer the lump was 4 cm and out of 11 lymp nodes 9 are positive?
4 cm breast tumor with 9 of 11 positive lymph nodes with no other clinical information given would be staged as stage 3 breast cancer (t2 n2 mx). there are many more factors than stage to asses breast cancer & its treatment options & risks.
what are the foods to be avoided if you have breast cancer?
there is much nonsense written about "what foods are good for you with this-or-that". there's little scientific reason to think this sort of thing matters. a few years ago a huge politically-driven study whose sponsors had hoped to show that "wholesome natural fruits and vegetables" improved prognosis in breast cancer was a complete and utter failure. don't let your life be spoiled by fearmongers.
what are the foods to be avoided if you have breast cancer?
there are no specific foods that you should avoid. you should eat a well balanced meal and possibly increase your protein intake if you have surgery to help heal the wounds. also you should let your medical and radiation oncologist know if you are taking supplements has some of these may interact negatively with your treatments.
what is the expected life span of stage 3 a her2 + 43 years old breast cancer patient?
overall survival of stage iii breast cancer 70% her2 breast cancers are aggressive so needs aggressive targeted chemotherapy with herceptin (trastuzumab) in combination with toxal ( and other chemo ) need to work closely with oncologist.
what is the expected life span of stage 3 a her2 + 43 years old breast cancer patient?
most her2 positive breast cancer are successfully treated. a large proportion of women are cured and live normal lives. but it all depends on the associated features of your cancer and the type of treatments given to you. i would say that the expected life span may be normal although it is impossisible to predict the future once you have had cancer. only time will define it. but i would be hopeful.
what are the necessary blood tests after treatment of breast cancer to detect if your ok. is ca 125 important?
ca-125 not important for breast cancer. good test for ovarian cancer. the most important things are routine physical exam. most recurrences are found by the patient or the physician. hope this helps. no routine blood tests have been shown to be of benefit. however if someone received chemotherapy i typically check blood because they received chemo.
what are the necessary blood tests after treatment of breast cancer to detect if your ok. is ca 125 important?
tumor marker ca 125 is not important in breast cancer is more for ovarian cancer and also non specific. unfortunately for breast cancer there is no specific tumor markers how ever ca 15. 3 ca 27. 29and cea levels found to useful for monitoring recurrences.
which is easier to cure a breast cancer who is a pr/er positive and her2 negative or er/pr negative and her2 positive? who has longer prognosis?
the survival and outcomes are better with receptor positive breast cancer. stage for stage the long term prognosis is better for this group. although herceptin (trastuzumab) has done a lot for women with her-2 positive disease it is still a less positive outcome than er pr positive cases.
why would a postmenapausal woman have breast soreness and drainage?
breast drainage in a post-menopausal women should be investigated--especially if it is only on one side or if it is bloody. usually it is the result of hormone supplements but can also be a sign of breast cancer. best wishes!
what are the survival statistics for breast cancer invasive ductal carcinoma?
most women with localized breast cancer do very well and there is high cure rate. overall 75%-80% of breast cancers are curable. but you need to know what stage of cancer it is? you should also know what subtype(there are 3 different types) of breast cancer it is. further there is the matter of what type of adjuvant therapy(post surgery treatment) was used. i'am sure your oncologist can answeryr.
what are the benefits we get from zometa and what are the side effect? i'm a her2 breast cancer stage 3 patient
i personally think there is a benefit based on the trials. specifically in post-menopausal women. not only treating or preventing osteoporosis but also preventing breast cancer recurrence. but i think the final answer is still unknown. the side effects are few but one which is rare can be problematic osteonecrosis of the jaw.
what are the benefits we get from zometa and what are the side effect? i'm a her2 breast cancer stage 3 patient
are used to treat and prevent bone metastasis. they have adverse effects and costs. they are indicated once established and to the best of my knowledge are being studied in early stage prior to relapse to establish benefit over risk. i would not advise a relative to use it; i'd discuss with your medical oncologist that has given you chemo and herceptin (trastuzumab).
what is the best doctor or hospital to go to for a rare aggressive cancer- small cell breast cancer with bone metasis? no cases are found in the u. s.
certainly there are well known centers in the u. s. with great reputations for experienced cancer care. but excellent care can be obtained at many centers across the country so it is important to weigh other factors as well. don't forget that proximity to friends and family is important as is the potential to need consistent followup care. seek multiple options and find physicians you trust.
what is the best doctor or hospital to go to for a rare aggressive cancer- small cell breast cancer with bone metasis? no cases are found in the u. s.
md andersond cancer center in texas is one of the premier cancer hospitals in the world and would be my recommendation with such a rare cancer. i have sent some of my patients there and they have an excellent system to get patients into their system while still communicating with your local doctors.
what causes nipple discharge if you're not pregnant? recently had a mammogram and a breast ultrasound. all was normal however it has not stopped.
nipple discharge may be due to physiologic/ hormonal changes or secondary to a breast abnormality affecting the milk ducts. if the discharge is from one duct there is more concern. especially if it is spontaneous bloody or clear. the most common cause is from a lesion called papilloma. breast cancer can also cause nipple discharge. therefore you need to have a thourough breast evaluation.
what things could cause a breast lump?
could be benign fibrocystic disease benign fibroadenona or benign breast cyst. breast cancer can be a firm breast lump. painful abscess or infection is possible. need to see a doctor for an examination.
where is the lymph node located that is sentinel node?
the sentinel node is not a specific node but rather the node that first receives drainage from a cancer. surgeons find it by injecting a tracer near the cancer and then seeing which node first takes up the tracer. the location depends on where the tumor is. sentinel lymph node biopsy is a procedure done by surgical oncologists for breast cancer melanoma and some other cancers.
what are symptoms of male breast cancer?
the most common presentation of breast cancer in male is a lump on the breast- usually underneath the nipple area. when it is more advanced- you can also find lymph gland enlargement on the arm pit area above the collar bone. in metastatic disease- where other organ is involved systemic problems like weight loss bony pain facture etc can happen. do not underestimate any lump on your breast.

both of these diseases are common may be related to estrogen in older women and if they occur at the same time may warn of a cancer family syndrome though the link isn't classic. neither causes the other. good luck.
what is the survival rate for stage 3 breast cancer?
this is a hard question. invasive ductal carcinoma is the most common type of breast cancer. it depends on whether it's stage3a b or c and the time of survival. at 5 years after diagnosis 50-60% of women with stage 3 breast cancer are alive. other factors are age receptor status of the tumor number of lymph nodes involved and treatment. remember that survival is improving all the time!
why would a doctor perform a lumpectomy?
a lumpectomy is performed to remove breast cancer with a margin of normal tissue around it. this is performed in order to conserve the breast. we know that having a lumpectomy with radiation versus a mastectomy has the same survival outcome.
what cancers does treating breast cancer raise the chance of getting?
this would depend on the type of treatment you receive. some chemotherapy regimens may increase the risk for certain blood malignancies and radiation my increase the risk for certain soft tissue malignancies. these are rare.
what is the common name for the breast cancer?
breast cancer is commonly named after the cell of origin within the breast. cancers that have the potential to spread elsewhere are called invasive or infiltrating cancers (in contrast to in situ cancers). most cancers arise in the milk ducts (infiltrating ductal cancer); the second-most common arise in the milk-producing lobules (infiltrating lobular cancer).
what is the common name for the breast cancer?
ductal carcinoma is most common breast cancer.
what is the survival rate for breast cancer with lymph node involvement?
there are lots of variables that help estimate survival including tumor size type number of lymph nodes involved and additional factors such as comorbidities (diabetes heart disease lung disease etc). here's a good reference: <link> good luck.
what is the survival rate for breast cancer with lymph node involvement?
there are just too many other variables that have to be weighed-in before answering this question such as the tumor type size grade ki-67 estrogen- progesterone- her2/neu receptor status oncotype-dx (in the appropriate setting) pt's age health etc. please remember that survival statistics often reflect how people were treated a decade ago when we had fewer options for rx than today.
whats the classification of breast cancer metastasis?
breast cancer staging is described as t (tumor size) n (lymph node metastases) and m (metastases to sites like bone lung etc). in a simplified short answer: stage 0 is non-invasive breast cancer stage 1 is no spread to lymph nodes stage 2 and stage 3 has lymph node spread and larger tumors and stage 4 would have metastases to other organs.
what is the difference between a diagnostic vs screening mammogram?
mammogram is an evaluation of both breasts that is performed on asymptomatic women to try and detect signs of breast cancer. a diagnostic mammogram consists of special views and is usually targeted to a specific area of the breast to further evaluate a potential abnormality seen on screening mammo or felt on clinical exam.
what are psychological effects of breast cancer and mets?
while breast cancer is a scary illness for most people (men can get it too) each person experiences it individually. having it extend to other parts of the body can make this much more frightening. some people become depressed anxious and have difficulty sleeping. there may be need to resolve old emotional issues. symptoms can also vary depending on where the mets are such as in brain.

what causes dcis breast cancer?
ductal carcinoma in situ dcis is simply the sleeping cancer cells inside the breast ducts like a garden hose loaded with cancer cells safe if they are inside the duct once they are out side then is invasive cancer ready to spread cause is unknown at this time from genetic mutations braca i & ii age hormonal uses. environment late age pregnancy life style etc are all attributed.
what causes dcis breast cancer?
probably has the same risk factors as any breast cancer. having a family history of bc is one of the most common "risk factors" but any woman can develop dcis just like all women are at some risk for developing breast cancer.
who takes arimidex (anastrozole) for breast cancer?
women who are post-menopausal and have estrogen receptor positive breast cancer.
who takes arimidex (anastrozole) for breast cancer?
aramidex belongs to a class of drugs called aromatase inhibitors. these block the production of estrogen in women after menopause and are very effective chemotherapeutic meds for estrogen (+) women w/breast cancer. they may also be used for chemoprevention: high risk women may lower their risk of developing breast ca when this medication is taken for 5 years.
wife had breast cancer 1 yr ago now her blood pressure is running very high. 180/120. dr gave her meds but it has not come down.?
breast cancer and high blood pressure are likely unrelated. her pressure is obviously too high so she needs continued evaluation and medication adjustments by her doctor soon.

would you be able to drive yourself home after radiation therapy or chemotherapy for breast cancer?
the oncologist(cancer specialist) can answer your question more effectively however radiation therapy usually allows a self-drive home. chemotherapy depending upon the "cocktail" used produces a lot of nausea/vomiting and generally not a good idea to self drive home.
would you be able to drive yourself home after radiation therapy or chemotherapy for breast cancer?
you should be able to drive yourself after radiation treatments. but you might want someone to drive you after the chemotherapy depending on which regimine you are on.
what can be done to treat male breast enlargement?
if breast enlargement is because of meds you are taking stopping that one med can help. ask your doctor -- don't stop meds on your own. checking hormone levels in your blood looking for liver tumors and if only one side rule out breast cancer or benign tumor of breast. gynecomastia is both sides getting bigger & most common. see a breast specialist if your reg md doesn't find anything!

majority survive with early diagnosis and management. regular self-exams mammograms assessment by physicians if strong family history or carrying brca gene are all helping earlier diagnosis and earlier care. talk to your pcp or oncologist for specific advice.
what are the chances of surviving breast cancer?
when caught early. the key to the cure is early detection which is best accomplished by routine screening mammography beginning at age 40. even when advanced we can now fine-tune our rx with ever-more-effective drugs. our next great challenge is prevention.
what are the chances of surviving breast cancer?
we now cure the large majority of breast cancers since we are finding them early.
what type of genetic mutation causes breast cancer?
if you inherit mutated brca1 or brca2 from a parent your odds are greatly increased. all cancers arise from accumulated mutations and natural selection over your own lifetime but these can actually be passed from parent to child.
what do i need to know about herceptin (trastuzumab) after breast cancer?
herceptin (trastuzumab) is a targetted therapy that inhibits her2-neu receptor. herceptin (trastuzumab) has been given to patient with her2neu receptor positive breast cancer with improvement of response and survival. herceptin (trastuzumab) has been also one of treatment options for her2 reeptor positive stomach cancer. read. mire about herceptin (trastuzumab) at www. cancer. net www. cancer. org www. nccn. com.
who should have a preventative mastectomy?
women who have already developed breast cancer in one breast and have a strong family history of the disease. women who have a positive result from genetic testing are candidates. genetic testing can identify if you have mutations in genes that increase your risk of breast cancer or other cancers such as ovarian cancer.
who should have a preventative mastectomy?
no one needs a prophylactic mastectomy. however those with a proven brca mutation have a 50-75% chance of developing breast cancer in their lifetime & may find a mastectomy their best option rather than fearing its development. new reconstructive options make this less traumatic but it's still a major decision best done w/a cancer surgeon and genetic counselor.
what does benign to malignancy mean in terms of breast lump?
benign is non-cancerous and this breast lump can be observed or left alone. malignant is cancerous and needs surgical excision of the cancer and consideration of medical oncology and radiation oncology treatments. there are many types of benign breast lumps and several types of breast cancers.
what are the chances of a 15 yo having breast cancer?
only a rare inheritable form could develop on such a patient and even their this would be very early. most any new change or lump in the breast would be related to hormonal changes or infection or something benign.
what are the chances of a 15 yo having breast cancer?
with very rare exceptions breast cancer occurs in women older than 30 years and usually older than that. see this site for more information on the subject. <link>
what are the chances of a 15 yo having breast cancer?
while not impossible it would be very rare.
what herbs are good for breast enlargement?
any herbal supplements possesing estrogen like properties have the potential to promote breast growth. for example marijuana is known to stimulate the growth of breasts in men. similarly. excessive intake of certain soy products may also simulate estrogen like side effects. in addition to those mentioned. however the potential for stimulating breast cancer growth and other side effects is unknown.
what are financial implications of using herceptin (trastuzumab) as a breast cancer treatment?
i have never had an issue of trastuzumab (herceptin) coverage in appropriate patients. individual co-pays are based on each patients insurance. there may be a benefit of trastuzumab in 0/low expression breast cancer that is the subject of a cooperative group clinical trial -- nsabp b-47 - clinicaltrials. gov id: nct01275677.
what are financial implications of using herceptin (trastuzumab) as a breast cancer treatment?
herceptin (trastuzumab) is a very expensive drug so the total cost of treatment will be obviously higher. that said it is a good drug and most insurances will cover its use in the appropriate setting. best regards.
what are financial implications of using herceptin (trastuzumab) as a breast cancer treatment?
herceptin (trastuzumab) is very effective for breast cancers that overexpress the her2/neu receptor. but as you point out it is very expensive. the financial implications are huge for the us healthcare system. studies done outside the us show that far less than 1 year of herceptin (trastuzumab) may be enough for treating early stage breast cancer but studies done in the us don't look at how to make treatments less costly.

what is metastatic breast carcinoma?
metastatic cancer is cancer that has spread from its organ of origin to another part of the body. for example the most common sites of metastases for breast cancer are the lungs liver and bone. most breast cancers when caught early and treated in a timely manner do not ever spread to other organs.
what do er and her2 positive mean in relation to breast cancer?
the er positive refers to the receptor status of the breast cancer. this means that the tumor has receptors to estrogen and that anti-estrogen therapy can be used to slow the growth of the tumor. her2 is a another receptor that is a target of a chemotherapeutic agent called herceptin (trastuzumab).
what do er and her2 positive mean in relation to breast cancer?
estrogen receptor (er) is measured to determine whether a tumor is sensitive to hormonal manipulation (things like tamoxifem arimidex or removal of ovaries - depending on your age and other factors. er+ tumors have better prognosis. in general her2 + tumors have a worse prognosis but these tumors may respond to herceptin (trastuzumab) or similar drugs.

cyst in the breast. fibrocystic change fibroadenoma mastitis and breast cancer. all could cause pain in the breast.
why would my breast implant hurt years after reconstruction due to breast cancer?
as dr. whitfield & others described scarring around the implant may cause this pain. however local recurrence of the tumor is another possible cause. i advise you to see your cancer surgeon as well. local recurrence is often evident by exam alone. however an ultrasound or mri can help supplement the physical exam as needed.
why would my breast implant hurt years after reconstruction due to breast cancer?
first you should be seen and examined. the most like cause is scarring or capsular contracture of you breast implant. you should follow up with your plastic surgeon who performed the procedure if possible. if this is not possible have and evaluation by a board certified plastic surgeon familiar with breast reconstruction.
why would my breast implant hurt years after reconstruction due to breast cancer?
capsular contraction is the most common cause of pain. capsule formation is normal however if advanced (baker iv) can be painful. this can be treated with revisional surgery to excise this capsule and try to improve the aesthetic appearance. because of your cancer history a thorough exam an the appropriate diagnostic studies by your plastic surgeon is definitely warranted.

contraction of the capsule or rupture of the implant can cause pain long after the implant was placed. there are some other importatnt causes to rule out as well. your plastic surgeon or breast cancer surgeon should be able to help you sort through the possible causes.
why would my breast implant hurt years after reconstruction due to breast cancer?
after breast reconstruction with implants the healing process may allow tightening of the skin and muscles which can cause something called contracture. if you received radiation therapy after your surgery then the possibility of contracture is increased and the effects take many months to b realized. it is possible for continued tightening of the tissues to occur for years. surgeon should see u.

what does it mean to have dense breasts?
are normal but decrease the sensitivity of the mammo for detecting cancers. some studies show that the sensitivity of mammography in this setting can decrease to lower than 50%. also dense breasts are an independent risk factor for developing breast cancer and cancers discovered in women with dense breasts tend to be more advanced. some recommend adjunct screening ultrasound or 3d tomosynthesis.
what does it mean to have dense breasts?
more than 1/2 of women have dense breasts on mammography. the breast tissue as opposed to the fat that occurs in the breast is what accounts for the density on mammography. there is evidence that women with denser breasts are at higher risk of developing breast cancer. the higher density can hide breast cancer and therefore make the mammogram more difficult to interpret. ultrasound can help.

what is the benefit of getting genetic breast cancer testing?
it will be useful for both patient and her children if a patient with breast cancer is + for brca 1/2 mutation- she also has sgnificant risk to develop ovarian cancer so prophylactic surgery would be recommended. other consequences for the family- the mutation can be inherited to the children-and if it's + screening mammogram & mri should be done earlier & prophylactic surgery'll be recommended.
what is the benefit of getting genetic breast cancer testing?
about 5 % of breast cancer patients may have brca 1 or brca 2. it is very important for patients who are positive for brca 1 or 2 who will be recommended to have resection of both breast and her ovarian also about 25% of breast cancer patients may have her 2 neu. cellular receptor is human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (her2/neu); its presence correlates with a poorer prognosis. the excellent.

i wrote a paper that answers this very question. in the 80's and most of the 90's it was thought that the prognosis for these patients was dismal. but looking at national cancer institute data of similar breast cancer patients with > 10 positive lymph nodes since 1998 the 5 year survival rate is 64%. this is a national average; some cancer centers post even better results!
what is the prognosis for someone who has stage 3 breast cancer with 16/17 positive lymph nodes?
stage 3 cancer means the breast cancer has extended to beyond the immediate region of the tumor and may have invaded nearby lymph nodes and muscles but has not spread to distant organs. although this stage is considered to be advanced there are a growing number of effective treatment options. this stage is divided into three groups: stage 3a stage 3b and stage 3c.
what should i do if i suspect breast cancer?
immediately see your physician for a detailed history and physical. diagnostic imaging (ultrasound or mammogram) may be indicated.
what should i do if i suspect breast cancer?
proper screening with self breast exams looking for new lumps breast exams by your physician looking for skin or nipple chanes as well as masses or lymph nodes and mammogram and ultrasound if needed are the best ways to pick up early stage breast cancer before it causes any symptoms. once advanced it can cause many different symptoms throughout the body.
what should i do if i suspect breast cancer?
the signs and symptoms of breast cancer include: a lump or thickening in or near the breast or in the underarm that persists through the menstrual cycle; change in the size shape or contour of the breast; blood-stained or clear fluid discharge from the nipple; change in the feel or appearance of the skin on the breast or nipple (dimpled puckered scaly or inflamed). if concerned see your doc.

what are signs that a lump could be breast cancer?
a lump is a lump but a lump that is associated with skin puckering or dimpling nipple inversion bloody nipple discharge or palpable bulky underarm lymph nodes is highly suspicious for cancer.
what are signs that a lump could be breast cancer?
it is very difficult to distinguish a benign breast lump from a cancer by exam alone for patient and doctor. in general cancers tend to be rock-hard 3-dimensionally round and can feel "fixed" within the breast. depending upon age and physical examination findings we will often get a mammogram and ultrasound to help evaluate a breast lump sometimes culminating in a (nonsurgical) biopsy.
what are some early indicators of breast cancer?
the signs and symptoms of breast cancer include: a lump or thickening in or near the breast or in the underarm that persists through the menstrual cycle; change in the size shape or contour of the breast; blood-stained or clear fluid discharge from the nipple; change in the feel or appearance of the skin on the breast or nipple (dimpled puckered scaly or inflamed).
what are some early indicators of breast cancer?
any palpable lump in the breast especially if it is painless can be due to breast cancer. any new change in the size or shape of the breast is also suspect and needs a check up with a doctor. a mammogram is advised for anything suspicious of breast cancer. annual mammography is recommended for all women past the age of 40 until 70 years of age in order to dectect small cancers which may not even.
what will breast cancer do to people who don't die from it?
breast cancer is definitely a deadly disease. the patients that survive deal with the psychological and physical ramifications from having cancer. many times the therapy (surgery chemotherapy radiation) can treat the cancer but also dramatically affect the patient's well being. seeing a plastic surgeon early can help patients deal with their disease and start to feel whole again.
what does swollen lymph nodes on right breast on mammogram mean?
numerous causes of adenopathy in most cases related to inflammation/infection. however occult breast cancer or other malignancy are also possibilities. your doctor needs to evaluate you for the cause of the adenopathy.

self exam visit your health provider for exam and to hone your skills and after age 40 mammogram.
what are some ways to identify whether i have breast cancer or not?
the best things you can do are monthly self breast exams along with yearly mammograms and physician exams. any newly found lumps or skin / nipple changes should prompt a physician visit. suspicious masses can be biopsied via a needle aspiration core needle or excision with pathologist examination of the tissue. the most important thing you can do is to not ignore any changes in your breasts.
what are the benefits of getting a breast reduction?
large breasts get in the way and may cause discomfort. lower neck upper back shoulder and breast pain are often significantly reduced or eliminated with breast reduction. shoulder rutting from bra straps and under breast rashes are also eliminated. breast reduction surgery reduces the risk of breast cancer. clothes fit better exercise is easier and women feel better about themselves.
what causes women to get breast cancer more often than men? is it because of cosmetics?
women have many more active cells in their breast tissue resposible for milk production. all of these cells respond and change to the monthly hormonal changes that a woman experiences all the way from their first menstrual cycle as a teenager to menopause. breast cancer most commonly forms in these active cells of the milk ducts or lobules. these breast tissue cells are much less prominent in men.
what are some tests to determine whether i have breast cancer or not?
have a breast physical examination mammogram possible breast ultrasound. needle biopsy may be indicated as well if there is an identified abnormality. biopsy is the only way to make a final diagnosis of what a breast mass is.
what are some tests to determine whether i have breast cancer or not?
doctor/nurse exam; mammography.
will there be natural ways to increase breast size in the future?
although still in its infancy manipulating our genomes may be the key to repairing damaged tissues (and yes increasing breast size). that technology is still far off. plastic surgeons are using fat grafting to augment breasts which is sort of "natural" since it uses your own tissues. unfortunately there are some concerns about fat grafts in the breasts making breast cancers harder to detect.
what is the likelihood of breast cancer if it runs within the family?
first degree relatives warrants a genetic work where a formal family pedigree is done as well as genetic testing forknown molecular risks: brca i and ii. when you worry ask to be referred for genetic testing and counseling.
what is the likelihood of breast cancer if it runs within the family?
one of the most significant risk factors for developing breast cancer is a family history of breast cancer. this is increased with first degree relatives with breast cancer ie sister or mother or father the brca gene mutation can be passed to a person from a mother or father and can increase the lifetime risk of developing breast cancer up to 85%.
what are the consequences of not getting treatment for breast cancer?
of what we call "neglected" breast cancer. . and it is not pretty. the skin of the breast can dissolve bleed grow and smell. it can leave deposits across the chest and back and as it is destroying the breast and skin cells can travel to brain bones liver. these women are miserable and sad. and hard to help.
what are the consequences of not getting treatment for breast cancer?
breast cancer progresses from stage 1 to 2 to 3 to stage 4 which is metastatic breast cancer to organs including the brain and lungs and liver and bones. breast cancer kills by spreading to the organs. early stage breast cancer has a very high cure rate if treated using conventional modalities including surgery radiation and hormone therapy and chemotherapy depending on the stage and type.
what are the consequences of not getting treatment for breast cancer?
breast cancers come in many different "shapes & sizes" with some more aggressive than others. however left untreated almost all will grow in the breast eventually breaking thru the skin and leading to an open wound. such cancers have a higher probability of spreading throughout the body potentially "taking over" vital organs such as the liver or lungs. why wait?
who should i talk to about getting a preventative double mastectomy?
if you are concerned about your risk of cancer due to several members of your family having had breast cancer it would be worthwhile going over your risk with a genetic counselor. regarding the surgery itself find a general surgeon breast surgeon or surgical oncologist that is experienced and also discuss breast reconstruction with a plastic surgeon.
what is ductal carcinoma and who does it affect the most?
this term typically refers to breast cancer which arises from the milk ducts of the breast. treatment depends on different patient preferences and testing results. it then involves a multidisciplinary approach which may involve surgery radiation and/or chemotherapy.
what is the definition or description of: microcalcifications?
microcalcifications are tiny specks of mineral deposits (calcium) that can be scattered throughout the mammary gland or occur in clusters. when found on a mammogram a radiologist will then decide whether the specks are of concern - usually this is not the case. commonly they simply indicate the presence of tiny benign cysts but can signify the presence of early breast cancer.
will an ultrasound be able to detect breast cancer?
ultrasound is most useful as a directed test to evaluate a mass seen on mammography or palpated on (self) exam. info from the ultrasound helps us decide if biopsy is necessary to check for cancer. ultrasound is also being used to screen for cancers; preliminary results are encouraging especially in women with dense breasts.
will an ultrasound be able to detect breast cancer?
depending upon the tissue density of a breast cancer relative to the density of the surrounding normal breast tissue many breast cancers can be detected by ultrasound. there are some cancers that are detected by us when a mammogram is normal and vice versa. of course a cancer detected by us needs to have a tissue diagnosis usually by an us guided core needle biopsy.
will an ultrasound be able to detect breast cancer?
the standard method for detecting breast cancer is mammography read by an experienced radiologist who mostly specializes in breast imaging. there are efforts to use mri but the full spectrum of mr imaging abnormalities is still being studied plus the methods for breast mri are still being tweaked. ultrasound can help guide biopsies once a lesion is found but is not as good for screening.
what can i do to get rid of my man boobs?
gymecomastia or "man boobs" should be evaluated prior to any treatment. 1% of all breast cancers occur in men. if no evidence of breast cancer laser-assisted or ultrasound-assisted (vaser) can be used to liquefy the fat which can then be removed with liposuction. if breast tissue remains under the nipple that can be removed through a small incision.

what are some causes of breast cancer?
breast cancer is common and often runs in families(it is genetic). but most often it can come on out of no where. so the cause is unknown in 90% of the cases. female hormones(estrogens have a lot to do with its causation. eat healthy(low fat diet) exercise and keep your weight normal do not smoke or drink alcohol. these are some precauations to reduce your risk. also get an annual mammogram.
what are some causes of breast cancer?
there are a couple of genes that predispose; truly high-dose radiation is a known risk. if a woman spends most of her reproductive life pregnant or lactating she's protected but this is not for everyone. some hormonal preparations raise risk. i'm skeptical about diet alcohol and smoking -- it's uncertain -- and i do not believe the "conservative" claim that it's linked to abortion.
what happens if you were diagnosed with stage 1 breast cancer and you decide not to do any treatment?
untreated breast cancer of any stage will progressively become worse over time without the proper treatments. the breast cancer will grow into more advanced stages & can become more difficult to treat.

why do so many people support breast cancer but not testicular cancer?
breast cancer is more common there is an industry to subsidize the events and pink ribbons (mammography machine manufacturers) body image is a concern and there is at least one demographic in which breast cancer carries a superstitious dread. the "activism" is a good thing overall. a sensible man who finds a testicular lump gets with his physician and usually gets a cure. less fearful overall.
what are the most significant breast cancer symptoms?
feeling a firm hard breast lump seeing breast skin or nipple being pulled inward breast skin ulceration firm hard lumps in the axilla area (armpit). do not wait for these findings. see a doctor for yearly breast examinations and consider yearly mammograms after age 40.
will getting breast implants reduce the risk of breast cancer?
there has never been shown to be a causal relationship between implants and breast cancer. in fact statistics show a lower incidence but this may be due to other factors. breast implants may delay or interfere with the diagnosis of breast cancer but survival rates are not effected. a higher risk of an atypical lymphoma has been documented but is extremely rare. sbe & special mammos are the rule!
will getting breast implants reduce the risk of breast cancer?
breast implants do not affect the rate of breast cancer according to the most recent plastic surgery research. there is a slightly increased risk of alcl in women with silicone implants.
will getting breast implants reduce the risk of breast cancer?
breast implants do not change your risk of developing breast cancer.
will getting breast implants reduce the risk of breast cancer?
breast implants definitely do not decrease the risk of breast cancer and really do not increase it either. the most important factor (implant or not) is following the breast cancer screening guidelines--frequent breast exams annual mammogram starting age 40 (unless family history of breast cancer then earlier). these can be done even in the setting of breast implants. occasionally mris are rec.
will getting breast implants reduce the risk of breast cancer?
they have no bearing on breast cancer. however a breast reduction will decrease your risk of breast cancer. this is because tissue is removed. less tissue less chance for cancer.
will getting breast implants reduce the risk of breast cancer?
breast implants will not reduce the risk of breast cancer.
will i be protected immediately after i get my breast implants removed?
since breast implants are not currently known to increase your risk of breast cancer i am not quite sure what you need protection from.

the risk of breast cancer at the age f 26 is very low. factors that would increase your risks would include a family history or an inherited breast cancer gene mutation breast cancer cases are considered either sporadic with a lifetime risk of 1 in 8 or genetic which may be a lot higher it would be important to know your risk factors.
what are the chances of getting breast cancer at 26?
but family history and genes (brca 1 or 2) can make it more common. these may be done at a cancer center.
what is survivor rate for female age 29 that has had breast cancer two years ago? . had chemo double mastectomy and radiation. she has the brac 1 gene
survival depends on the stage of the cancer.

what's the prognosis for my mom with stage 3 breast cancer?
by statistics alone realizing each person responds to treatments differently the national cancer data base describes a nearly 50% survival over 5 years. but each individual person is different. her oncologist can give better answers for her specific situations.
what are the two main types of breast cancer?
the the two common types of breast cancer are ductal and lobular. lobular cancers start from the groups of cells that produce milk when you have a baby. ductal cancers start from the cells form the hollow tubes or ducts that carry the milk to the nipple.
what are the two main types of breast cancer?
ductal and lobular are two types of breast cancer and they can be non-invasive (in situ) or invasive types.
what causes someone to have inverted nipples?
inverted nipples may be natural if you have had them for a long time. many times previous episoded of infection or matitis in the area behind the nipple will result in scarring and pulling the nipple inward. breast cancer is also one of the causes. therefore it is recommended to have your breast checked by a breast care specialist to rule out (or confirm) possiblity of an underlying cancer.
what are other options other than chemotherapy for stage 2 breast cancer?
this depends on the type of breast cancer you have. treatment is now individualized to the type of cancer lymph node involvement and hormone status of the cancer cells. a special test called a oncotype dx can help determine if chemotherapy is beneficial or not but the cells have to have hormone receptors. i recommend speaking with your oncologist. don't be afraid to get a 2nd opinion.
what are other options other than chemotherapy for stage 2 breast cancer?
if you or your loved one has a stage 2 breast cancer you may want to ask your physician to consider a test called oncotype dx to assess whether this is considered a "high-risk" breast cancer versus low risk. based on the score of the test it might better tell you whether it is worth treating with chemotherapy. depending on receptor subtype of the tumor endocrine therapy might be suggested.
what is the difference between breast cancer and a tumor?
a tumor is a general term for a lump or mass in any location in the body. it can be cancerous or noncancerous. breast cancer refers to malignant cells found in the breast. there are many benign/noncancerous tumors that can be found in the breast. usually a needle biopsy is performed to determin if cancer is present.
what is the difference between breast cancer and a tumor?
all tumors are growths that result from mutated genes. cancers are tumors in which the genome has not only mutated but become destabilized giving the power to evolve into invasive forms. many tumors are quite benign in distinction from cancer. this is a common point of confusion even among student doctors and is a very good question.
what are the common symptoms for breast cancer?
oftentimes breast cancers are found with routine mammography. by getting yearly mammograms differences in the breast tissue can be visualized with the mammogram. in some instances women may feel a new mass in their breast notice a growing mass in the breast or potentially have spontaneous bloody nipple discharge. these are only some symptoms; make sure to get breast exam if concerned.
what are the common symptoms for breast cancer?
almost always a painless mass unless found on mammogram. sometimes thickening "orange peel" change in the skin new retraction of the nipple dimpling of the skin or a rash on the nipple. any dominant mass needs a physician's office visit.
what are the main symptoms of breast cancer?
early breast cancer has no signs or symptoms. breast cancer may later present as a painless firm breast lump. rarely changes in color of the skin sometimes nipple will get retracted or breast skin pulled inward. best is to have yearly physical examination and mammogram after age 40 before these symptoms occur. any breast lump painful or not should be examined by your doctor.

oftentimes breast cancers are found with routine mammography. by getting yearly mammograms differences in the breast tissue can be visualized with the mammogram. in some instances women may feel a new mass in their breast notice a growing mass in the breast or potentially have spontaneous bloody nipple discharge. these are only some symptoms; make sure to get breast exam if concerned.
what is the role of estrogen in breast cancer?
about 80% of breast cancer are er positive which means that the cancer cells are stimulated to grow by estrogen in the body. decreasing the estrogen levels with tamoxifen which is an estrogen blocker in premenopausal women and aromatase inhibitors which stop estrogen production in sites other than the ovaries in post menopausal women is an important treatment.
what is the role of estrogen in breast cancer?
certain cancers are hormonally dependent. specifically some breast cancer has become much more understood to be stimulated by unopposed estrogens. not all breast cancer is caused by hormones. however the most common forms due tend to be hormonally dependent. there are other factors that lead to the development but pros of taking hormones must be weighed against increased risk of breast cancer.
what happens at an breast mri if your not screening for breast cancer but screening for both breasts that have inverted nipple discharge? i'm 18.
mri has a high sensitivity but low specificity and often finds many benign lesions. that increases worry and leads to more tests and biopsies but rarely finds cancer. i wouldn't recommend mri here. bilateral nipple discharge is common and not worrisome for cancer and cancer at age 18 is extremely unlikely. there are other tests to determine the cause of the discharge or if it is of concern.
what happens at an breast mri if your not screening for breast cancer but screening for both breasts that have inverted nipple discharge? i'm 18.
it is very unusual for an 18 year old to have a breast cancer and a congenital cause for your nipple inversion is more likely ask your doctor why they ordered the mri.
what happens at an breast mri if your not screening for breast cancer but screening for both breasts that have inverted nipple discharge? i'm 18.
an mri for breast screening at age 18 seems unusual. generally a physical examination breast ultrasound and possibly mammogram would be used more commonly. screening for nipple inversion also seems unusual as nipple inversion can be normal and a chronic stable condition for some women. otherwise an mri of the breast is the same for all conditions being evaluated.
what happens at an breast mri if your not screening for breast cancer but screening for both breasts that have inverted nipple discharge? i'm 18.
nipple changes/discharge is almost invariably due to benign causes particularly in an 18 year old in whom the baseline probability of malignancy is remote. but to answer your question the breast mri is performed the same way for screening as it is for a diagnostic work up.
what happens at an breast mri if your not screening for breast cancer but screening for both breasts that have inverted nipple discharge? i'm 18.
rarely do screening for breast cancer unless patient is at high risk. you are evaluating an abnormality so the test is the same.
what causes breast abscesses?
breast abscesses usually arise from normal skin bacteria traveling thru the nipple ducts & multiplying under the skin. this is most common in women who are breast feeding due to nipple trauma. when it occurs unrelated to lactation we need to include breast cancer as a possible cause & do the appropriate tests.
which one is more accurat mammogram or mri to discover breast tumor in case of breast silicon implant?
sensitive at detecting breast cancer than mammography. however mr is not an ideal screening test for a variety of reasons and mammography remains the standard of care.
what can be used vs tamoxiphen if a person had breast cancer 6 yeasts ago and now can not handle tamoxiphen because of its comication?
depends on if you have undergone menopause. if you have aromatase inhibitors are an option. if no menopause they may still be an option with additional medications to shut down your ovaries. another option may be raloxifene. please discuss with your medical oncologist.
what can be used vs tamoxiphen if a person had breast cancer 6 yeasts ago and now can not handle tamoxiphen because of its comication?
you need to speak to your oncologist but this class of drugs is commonly used.
would multiple multi-phase protocol hd chest cts several months apart impose too much radiation hazard if patient is already at risk for breast cancer?
studies have documented a certain yet low risk of breast cancer to the use of diagnostic xray based imaging. the risk depends on age of the patient and the amount (or dose) of exposure. you and your doctor should discuss this risk versus the possible benefit to your current health issues for which these ct scans are being considered. the radiologist performing the ct's will know the dose.
would multiple multi-phase protocol hd chest cts several months apart impose too much radiation hazard if patient is already at risk for breast cancer?
we are now trying to avoid ordering too many ct scans in high risk patients and the concern is real.
what if you have breast cancer but it hasn't spread yet what treatment is recommended?
there's variability in the aggressiveness of cancers. size matters too even if lymph nodes are negative. hormonal receptor status and other prognostic features help in the treatment planning. breast conservation requires radiation treatment for most. chemo may not be helpful but best to follow through with consultations no matter how early it was caught. your surgeon should guide you.
what if you have breast cancer but it hasn't spread yet what treatment is recommended?
on what type of cancer it is (invasive or dcis). but the norm is lumpectomy + radiation + anti-estrogen therapy if the tumor is estrogen receptor positive. aggressive tumors or those that have spread to lymph nodes warrant chemotherapy as well.
what if you have breast cancer but it hasn't spread yet what treatment is recommended?
this depends on the size and nature of the tumor. in general the treatment for breast cancer involves surgery and sometime radiation and chemo/hormone therapy.
what is the symptoms for breast cancer as my wife complain from pain in breast and feel that they are heavy?
proper screening with self breast exams looking for new lumps breast exams by your physician looking for skin or nipple chanes as well as masses or lymph nodes and mammogram and ultrasound if needed are the best ways to pick up early stage breast cancer before it causes any symptoms. once advanced it can cause many different symptoms throughout the body.
what is the symptoms for breast cancer as my wife complain from pain in breast and feel that they are heavy?
breast pain can be caused by different things like infection inflammation hormonal food fibrocystic disease malignancy etc. although breast pain is not a common presentation for breast cancer but it can happen. go to see her gyne or pmd and have her breast examined. mammogram and sono would be helpful to eval the breast. cut down coffee/caffeinated drink. nsaids and cold compress can help.
what is the symptoms for breast cancer as my wife complain from pain in breast and feel that they are heavy?
the most common symptom of breast cancer is no symptom at all. breast pain is not a common symptom of breast cancer.
what is the symptoms for breast cancer as my wife complain from pain in breast and feel that they are heavy?
early breast cancer has no symptoms later painless lump will be felt before spreading to lymph nodes and other organs most of the time painful breasts are due to benign fibrocystic disease. she must be examined by her doctor after examination will order mammography and other tests as needed. do not worry take her to doctor thank you dr berg for the nice comment.
what is the symptoms for breast cancer as my wife complain from pain in breast and feel that they are heavy?
a lump that is associated with skin puckering or dimpling nipple inversion bloody nipple discharge or palpable bulky underarm lymph nodes is highly suspicious for cancer. however many early breast cancers will have no symptoms as they are found only on mammogram.
what is the symptoms for breast cancer as my wife complain from pain in breast and feel that they are heavy?
most breast cancer presents as a painless lump in the breast. pain is more likely benign but persistent or focal pain should be worked up including a physical exam mammogram and possibly an ultrasound. if negative there are some things that can be considered to help alleviate the pain.
what diet is best for breast cancer patient?
you should maintain a healthy diet. after surgery it is important to increase your protein content to heal your wounds.
what diet is best for breast cancer patient?
it has been shown that keeping your weight to normal levels and exercising regularly and eating a diet with plenty of fruit and vegetables is associated with some reduction in breast cancer recurrence.
what diet is best for breast cancer patient?
sure that anything beyond a sensible diet is proven to reduce breast cancer recurrence. i may be wrong but keeping the weight at a good level may play a role but with estrogen receptor blockers i'm not sure that there is data on that. the study size would have to be huge i would think to notice these subleties.
what would doctors recommend breast reconstruction with mastectomy or lumpectomy?
most breast cancers can be surgically treated with equal success by mastectomy or lumpectomy (+radiation). therefore given the option most women choose the much less invasive rx of a lumpectomy. many other issues may factor into this decision--age family hx mammogram findings pathology etc--therefore a critical part of one's preoperative evaluation is to fine-tune this recommendation.
what is the difference between screening mammogram and diagnostic mammogram? why does the diagnostic one have to be done with breast ultrasound?
the purpose of a screening mammogram is to identify breast cancer in women who have no signs of disease while the purpose of a diagnostic mammogram is to obtain more detail on a known abnormality identified on prior physical exam or imaging study. a diagnostic mammogram need not always be done with an ultrasound.
what is the difference between screening mammogram and diagnostic mammogram? why does the diagnostic one have to be done with breast ultrasound?
mammogram is a study of both breasts that is performed on asymptomatic women to try and detect signs of breast cancer. a diagnostic mammogram consists of special views and is usually targeted to a specific area of the breast to further evaluate a potential abnormality seen on screening mammo or felt on clinical exam. the diagnostic doesn't have to have an us but us usually very helpful.
what tests are required for taking raloxifene?
the primary indications for raloxifene are for bone strength/density which is assessed via a bone densitometry study. the other role is for breast cancer chemoprevention with requires risk assessment by one of several models such as the gail model. the risk level used in the primary trial was a 5 year risk of >1. 67%.
what could be the causes of increased uptake by a nonenlarged subcarinal node on pet scan in a patient with breast cancer?
a pet scan will generally show 3 main groups of findings. infection inflammation or cancer. with a history of breast cancer a biopsy may be considered but that will depend on the details of the situation.
what could be the causes of increased uptake by a nonenlarged subcarinal node on pet scan in a patient with breast cancer?
although clearly one has to be concerned about the possibility of metastatic breast cancer there are many causes of "hot" subcarinal lymph nodes on pet scan. the only definitive way to evaluate the area would be with a biopsy or fine needle aspiration with pathological examination. good luck.
what could be the causes of increased uptake by a nonenlarged subcarinal node on pet scan in a patient with breast cancer?
infection or possibly metastatic disease.
what are alternatives to zometa/xgeva for bone loss/sre prevention in breast cancer bone mets that do not decrease calcium? thank you.
the alternative is avoid both and not take anything as there is nothing else available that helps. but low calcium is of no consequence especailly with zometa.

what you mean. breast cancer that has spread to other sites or other organs might be described as being systemic. would need more information to be sure that i understand your question correctly.
what is systemic breast cancer?
what makes any cancer "evil" is the potential for cancer cells to break away & travel thru the bloodstream or lymphatics & take up residence in a different organ. systemic disease implies that there are cancer cells "elsewhere" either indirectly identified by microscopic examination (+lymph node) or seen on x-ray studies (metastatic disease). rx requires meds that travel "elsewhere" ie chemo-rx.

why do we have so much breast cancer awarensess but no testicular cancer campaigns in the us?
you raise a good question especially since both cancers are curable at a very high percentage if diagnosed early. one reason for the difference in campaigns is likely in the aggressiveness of the respective advocacy groups for both diseases. this is likely reflective of the fact that only 1in 200 men develop testicular cancer in their lifetime compared to 1 in 8 women developing breast cancer.
wondering if it's just women who suffer from breast cancer or can men develop the cancer as well?

what is breast tissue dense breast tissue pleaz help got my mammogram back it said i have dense breast tissues what is that?
dense breasts have a higher concentration of normal fibroglandular stroma than less dense breasts. although it is normal tissue it makes the mammo less sensitive in the detection of cancer because visualization of the cancer may be obscurred by the dense tissue. dense breasts have also been shown to be an independent risk factor for developing breast cancer.

tamoxifen has other indications aside from treatment of breast cancer such as reducing the risk of breast cancer in women who carry high risk for developing breast cancer. it has many side effects that need to be taken into consideration before taking this medicine. it needs to be prescribed by a health care provider who is familiar in its indications and side effects. do not take it on your own.
what could replace tamoxiphen in second 5 years after breast cancer? tamoxiphen caused me ovarian cyst and uterus thickening. thanks
tamoxifen for 5 years followed by letrozole would be an option. however technically you are still premenopausal so not an option. another treatment which is controversial is to have your ovaries removes. there is data on 10 years of tamoxifen now but you may not want to do this. the other option would be observation. hope this helps.

would a breast u/s pick up a tumor deep in chest wall? i can't get mammo due to nursing. have back neck shoulder aches and convinced its breast cancer
the breast is not deep in the chest wall. it is a skin appendage. that being said a mammogram and an ultrasound and an mri can pick up all sorts of problems. breast feeding does not prevent you from getting a mammogram. back neck and shoulder aches are not the initial signs of breast cancer. you need to relax enjoy your baby and talk to your doctor. good luck.
would a breast u/s pick up a tumor deep in chest wall? i can't get mammo due to nursing. have back neck shoulder aches and convinced its breast cancer
the cause of any severe persistent pain is not hard to find. ask your doctor to rule out cancer which he/she can do with the available tests. but do not put words in their mouth. they can check your breast with mammography(even you are nursing there is no harm) ultrasound and mri(if needed as it is quite expensive). bones and joints can be easily checked with x-rays and bone scan.
worried that my back shoulder neck aches is masking as breast cancer. read story on woman who had those symptoms and had stage 4 mets breast cancer.
it is not difficult to tell the cause of your pain. if you have good insurance then your doctor can order tests besides doing a good examination of your breast by physical exam and mammography. bone scan is a good test to make sure that your bones are free of cancer. please discuss these options with your doctor and get over this anxiety!
would a breast ultrasound detect a tumor that was deep in chest?
sensitivities for ultrasound in detecting cancer vary generally 60-80% so ultrasound can detect breast cancers but like any test it is not 100%. a complete workup might include mammography physical exam and in some cases mri. talk to your doctor about your concerns. if you are talking about a mass that is actually within the chest cavity not the breast breast us won't help.

it is unlike that a lump is cancer if it has not grown at all in 6 months although some breast cancers do grow very slowly. it is difficult to evaluate breast lumps by physical exam as pregnancy progresses because the breasts become engorged. ultrasound is a good method of following the lump but i defer to your physician to decide whether or not excision should be considered.
would breast cancer have increased in size in 6 months? i'm pregnant 28 years old. had ultrasound that showed no change in area from six months ago.
this is most likely a noncancerous lump. i recommend finding a breast specialist in your area who can examine you and review your films. if you have concerns a needle biopsy can be performed.

worried that the breast biopsy(which was benign breast tissue) i had which caused bruising and inflammation will lead to breast cancer. can it?
there is no evidence that indicates there is any chance of that. they ask about breast biopsies in risk assessment not because the biopsies themselves cause cancer but because having breast biopsies indicates that the breasts themselves have suspicious or equivocal findings already.

what is the survival rate for her-2 breast cancer stage 1 to 2 grade 3 for a 70 yr old?
if tumor greater than 0. 5 cm then i would recommend adjuvant herceptin (trastuzumab). if she does not have a lot of medical problems one would also consider adding chemotherapy as well. if er + then would also recommend an aromatase inhibitor. with a her2 positive tumor there is a target to block. that improves the outcome. hope this helps.

what is dence breast tissue?
it is a mammographic finding indicating more glandular tissue than fat. it is commonly found in younger women who have more prolifrative tissue which slightly increases the risk of breast cancer. importantly it makes it difficult to see small breast cancers in the dense tissue. such women require additional rests like ultrasound if there is any suspicion or doubt of a breast mass.

this depends on the type of tumor involvement in other areas or spread/metastasis how healthy the patient is and the stage. in general the treatments are: surgery radiation chemotherapy and hormonal therapy. every individual is treated according to her/his cancer. there are many websites with more information: komen. org breastcancer. org cancer. gov
whos the best perdon to see about possible breast cancer in women?
hello- please discuss your concerns with your primary care physician (pcp). if you have any symptoms or signs please see him/her right away. if you have a strong family history of breast cancer (or other cancers) you may benefit from a visit with a genetic counselor. please quit smoking as it does increase your risk of breast and other cancers. best wishes.
whos the best perdon to see about possible breast cancer in women?
who deals with the breast. today there are doctors who specialize in the breast they would be the best for eval. if diagnosis not made. or work up just starting your pcp can help you in the right direction
what is the mmtv virus in relation to breast cancer? how to avoid it?
mmtv causes benign tumors in mice. attempts to find a breast cancer virus in humans have been going on for decades and have been impressively unsuccessful with a couple of "independent thinkers" doing all the work and generating a lot of scare stuff. although they wrote the current "wikipedia" article you need to know that most of us do not beileve that avoiding a virus is the key.
why is mammography not recommended as screening tool for women in 30s to check for breast cancer? bc their risk is low or bc of dense breasts?
younger women are at lower risk and the sensitivity of mammo is decreased in the setting of dense breasts(which tend to be in younger women). there is no compelling scientific data that demonstrates any benefit to screening average risk women in their 30s. however high risk younger women(e. g. brca carriers) may be candidates for screening in their 30s or even younger.
why is mammography not recommended as screening tool for women in 30s to check for breast cancer? bc their risk is low or bc of dense breasts?
of both. risk/benefit ratio is high for this age group to recommend routine screening mammography unless there is genetic predisposition or positive family history.
what number of people in the us have breast cancer?
that's how many new breast cancer diagnoses will be made in 2014. in 2011 there were an estimated 2 899 726 women living with breast cancer in the united states. that's almost 3 million. for more numbers go to <link>
what are the causes and symptoms of her-2 positive breast cancer?
symptoms of breast cancer are not related to subtype.
what are the causes and symptoms of her-2 positive breast cancer?
cancer in general. please consult this site for more information. <link>
what are the symptoms of early stage her2 positive breast cancer?
her2 cancers may tend to grow and spread faster than her2 negative cancers. there are also specific medicines that can be used with her2 positive cancers. however there are really no symptoms specific for a her2 cancer. like all early stage cancers there may be no symptoms(and the cancer is detected on mammogram or ultrasound) or there may be a palpable mass.
what are the symptoms of early stage her2 positive breast cancer?
the symptoms of early stage her2+ bc are the same as her2 neg bc: lump or abnormal m/g are the most common presenting features of bc.
what are the symptoms of early stage her2 positive breast cancer?
her2 refers to a gene present in some nl cells but turned on in ~15% of breast cancers assoc w/more biologically aggressive tumor. the tumor itself does not produce symptoms different from any other early stage breast cancer. in its earliest appearance it may produce no clinical symptoms/findings but imaging findings. later a palp mass may develop but usually still asymptomatic.
what am i too expect after breast cancer?
that would depend on your status of health and the treatment you underwent. your question is way too vague to give you any specific advice.
what am i too expect after breast cancer?
that question is too open ended and we don't have enough info to even give you an idea. i recommend you find a good group of specialists working within a multidisciplinary program. read about your condition (in reputable sites) and ask lots of questions to understand what's going on. fight well and god bless.
what am i too expect after breast cancer?
i agree with other clinicians that the answer is somewhat vague but i think the typical experience after breast cancer is close clinical follow-up and breast imaging. usually the patient will follow closely with a medical oncologist and have routine clinical breast exams and mammograms every 6-12 months if you didn't have a mastectomy. you may also be on antihormonal therapy for up to 10 years.
what am i too expect after breast cancer?
we need to know the stage of disease and whether the tumor expresses hormone receptors her 2 in order to estimate prognosis and make treatment recommendations. you should see a medical oncologist and surgeon experienced with breast surgery to obtain recommendations. the overall prognosis for breast cancer particularly early stage has markedly improved over the last 3 decades.
what to do if i have intented a formula that can cure first stage of breast cancer how can i share it to the world?
you will need to open a clinical trial to make sure that it is not just a pure luck/chance and no bias and it is something that is reliable. clinical trial has to be run in certain ways to ensure quality control of the result. then following a clinical trial then you can publish the result.
why is it that some patients who are in stage 1 dcis have to have a partial mastectomy followed by radiation?
dcis is a stage 0 breast cancer. a lumpectomy is only comparable to a mastectomy when the lumpectomy is followed by radiation. otherwise the risk of the cancer recurring in the same breast is higher. for some older patients (over 70) radiation may be optional after a lumpectomy.
what do i do if my 69 yo mom have breast cancer? please need some answers?
breast cancer in patients even at 90 years of age should be treated. obviously the procedure should be modified that if the lesion is 2 cm or less a local excision with margins can be utilized and radiation with held. sometimnes addition of anti hormones can further improve result but surgical removal required.
what other problems could also present similar symptoms to breast cancer?
breast cancer lumps rarely cause pain but benign lumps like breast cysts are often painful.
would low o2 saturation levels at night below 90 for 2 to 3 hours with cpap result from breast cancer radiation? normal lung function chest x-ray
radiation damage to the lung can be detected functionally on pulmonary function tests. if your pulmonary function tests are completely normal it would be unlikely that radiation lung damage was the cause of the fall in 02 saturation.
will faslodex (fulvestrant) work for estrogen negative receptor breast cancer?
not indicated for estrogen receptor negative breast cancer.
wanted to know if biopsies for breast cancer really take three hours and are super painful?
the wait time from check in at a radiology department to actually doing the procedure may take that long but the actual biopsy should take minutes. it is typically a very fast pass-through with a needle and most patients do not find it uncomfortable enough to warrant any sort of pre-medication.
what to do if i do not have monthly period for about 2 years and 9 moths because of chemotherapy and because of taking tamoxifen for breast cancer.?
chemotherapy in women as young as you and also tamoxifen may stop periods (usually temporarily at your age). you should not assume you cannot get pregnant barrier contraception is still recommended (if you follow contraceptive practices - tamoxifen during pregnancy is not recommended). if it is causing menopausal symptoms discuss them with your prescribing physician as there are options.
wanted to know if clusters of microcalcifications mean you have breast cancer?
while stable calcifications over time (ie years) on a mammogram are less likely to be due to cancer any changing calcifications are likely to come with the recommendation for a biopsy because of the correlation between changing calcifications and cancer. the pattern of calcifications is interpreted by the radiologist as suspicious or benign.
what is the function of her2/neu and how is it related to breast cancer?
her2 is a receptor on the surface of some breast cancers. it is like a light switch that tells the cancer to grow. breast cancer cells that have many her2 receptors have the light switch always turned on telling the cells to grow. fortunately newer drugs block the receptor turning off the growth switch and making these cancers very treatable.
what is the function of her2/neu and how is it related to breast cancer?
human epithelial growth factor. found in more aggressive cancers of the breast. there are targeted treatments (herceptin (trastuzumab) and perjeta) that used in combination w chemotherapy have improved treatment of these patients.
what is the function of her2/neu and how is it related to breast cancer?
it is a distinct sub type of breast cancer(there are two other types of breast cancer). it is characterized by an over expression of a protein called her2 which makes this cancer to be much more aggressive in its behavior. fortunately we now have available an antibody called trastuzumab or herceptin (trastuzumab) which is widely used and is very effective in controlling the growth of this type of cancer.
what to do if i have triple negative metastatic breast cancer stage iv?
for starters find a good oncologist preferably one who works within a multidisciplinary team and has access to clinical trials. there are too many variables to give you specifics but very likely you will be offered chemo. depending on the circumstances surgery or radiation may come to play. you had 3x- cancer before age 60 and fulfill criteria for brca testing. if positive (or even if not).
why are markers left in the chest of previous breast cancer patients? i can see them on x-rays and do they hurt?
if the marker were one used to define a non palpable lesion for localization of tumor it should have been resected with the lesion. if the patient underwent mastectomy the radio opaque clips are vascular clips used to control chest wall blood vessels that were bleeding during the procedure and used to stop bleeding. they are permanent and do not cause any related symptoms. and are never removed
why are markers left in the chest of previous breast cancer patients? i can see them on x-rays and do they hurt?
leaving them in is safe and often easier than subjecting yourself to the risk of removing them. they should not be painful.
why are markers left in the chest of previous breast cancer patients? i can see them on x-rays and do they hurt?
these can be from prior radiation or at the site of previous surgery. these can help in the future if further treatment is needed. in the case of radiation it help to position the beam. it also pinpoints the precise area of the previous tumor. this not harmful to the pt to remain.
what do you suggest if my left nipple is so itchy. is it breast cancer?
and at your age rather unlikely. you should see your doc about it though. even a benign condition may need therapy.
what do you suggest if my mother has breast cancer. can anyone answer some of my questions?
first appropriate staging should be done (biopsy imaging). second based off of the stage treatment options should be presented to her. then discuss treatment options and decide what seems to be the best treatment for her as different treatment options may be better for different people even if the stage is the same. feel fee to return to this site with additional questions.
should i make any changes in my diet or physical exercise to reduce the risks of breast cancer?
physical activity is associated with a decreased risk of breast cancer. you should do at least 30 minutes of vigorous activity 3 or more times a week. a high fat diet is associated with an increased risk of breast cancer so cut down on fried or fatty foods.
should i make any changes in my diet or physical exercise to reduce the risks of breast cancer?
veggies - whole foods! just move it whatever it takes. 6 days a week. start slow.
should i make any changes in my diet or physical exercise to reduce the risks of breast cancer?
thnk healthy. if you r under forty get 7-8 hours of slee; eat fresh vegetables and fruits include all food typesinclude poly/monosaturated fats importan carbohydrates two eggs per week meats about 2-3 per week fish at least twice per week; drink 6-8 glasses water equivalent daily; maintain bmi normal. active lifestyle equivalent of 45 mintues aerobic 4 times wk. stairs. walkweightwater.
should i make any changes in my diet or physical exercise to reduce the risks of breast cancer?
fat (adipose) tissue is a source of estrogen production. this is the probable reason why overweight and obese women are at increased risk for breast cancer. breast cancers that are hormonally responsive (receptor positive) may also progress more rapidly in those with excess adipose tissue. if yor body mass is high due to muscle not fat - then there is probably no increased risks wrt br ca.
should i make any changes in my diet or physical exercise to reduce the risks of breast cancer?
several studies have shown being overweight adversely affects survival for postmenopausal women with breast cancer. similarly studies have shown that losing weight and exercising regularly increases survival in breast cancer patients.
should i make any changes in my diet or physical exercise to reduce the risks of breast cancer?
if you have a normal body weight a normal healthy life style is ok. (few mins of exercise each day and avoid diet with high fat content).
should i make any changes in my diet or physical exercise to reduce the risks of breast cancer?
nutrition plays an important roll in cancer risk. try this tool to learn more: <link>
should stage 1 breast cancer patients with no lymph node involvement generally receive chemo?
while the prognosis for stage 1 breast cancer is excellent many women may benefit from traditional chemotherapy. this is dependent on the age of the patient whether the tumor is hormone-sensitive if the her2/neu receptor is overexpressed and in select cases what the oncotype-dx score is. while "negative" lymph nodes are very encouraging some breast cancers may travel via the bloodstream.
should stage 1 breast cancer patients with no lymph node involvement generally receive chemo?
this depends on the tumor characteristics. best to discuss this your friendly oncologist.
should stage 1 breast cancer patients with no lymph node involvement generally receive chemo?
if the tumor is hormone positive and or her2 positive there is chemo hormone blockerstypically radiation lumpectomy followed by anti hormone meds. on the other hand triple negative breast cancer stage i will most likely need chemotherapy iv. it is a bit controversial about a tumor less than 5mm but anything above that has lumpectomy node bx and adjuvant chemonow docs are trying chemo presurg.
should men get mammograms regularly?
incidence of breast cancer in men is too low to warrant a general screening program. individual men with high risk profiles however might be candidates for screening.
should men get mammograms regularly?
currently there are no guidelines for breast cancer screening in men.
should men get mammograms regularly?
mammograms are not indicated as a screening test for men due to the low incidence of breast cancer (~1:1000). men at high risk for breast cancer may have mammograms however.
severe depression and anxiety. previously prescribed prozac and xanax to cope. no insurance and can't go to my personal doctor. also was diagnosed with breast cancer sarcoidosis and adrenal gland disorder. had a complete mastectomy about 5 years ago.
i don't know what area you are from. but many communities have clinics which are free or sliding fee scale. you can google this for your area.
severe depression and anxiety. previously prescribed prozac and xanax to cope. no insurance and can't go to my personal doctor. also was diagnosed with breast cancer sarcoidosis and adrenal gland disorder. had a complete mastectomy about 5 years ago.
with your medical history it is prudent to check in with your doctor and get follow up visits regularly. it will be important to find out if your cancer has returned. the treatment regimen you choose is up to you. your doctor can let you know the different paths you can take if you are to deal with a recurring cancer. your doctor can recommend treatments that can help your cancer go back into remission and provide you with resources for coping with the disease such as group therapy and medication to diminish pain. or you can choose a path that does not involve treatment and work with your doctor to control pain and stress. the stress you feel is understandable. do see your doctor regularly and especially if you are experiencing loss of appetite and fear. make an appointment and warm regards.
should women be concerned about breast cancer?
1 in 8 women in the us will develop breast cancer in their lifetime and most women affected will have no definable risk factor. therefore at this time it is critical for all women over age 40 to have a screening mammogram (yearly). when breast cancer is caught before it becomes palpable the chance for cure is very high and the treatment options are greatest. mammograms save lives!
should women be concerned about breast cancer?
yes.
should women be concerned about breast cancer?
yes but not paranoid. make healthy choices and have routine testing when appropriate. breast cancer treatments are now very successful.
side effects of tamoxifen?
<link> the known serious side effects of tamoxifen are blood clots strokes uterine cancer and cataracts. other side effects include menopause-like symptoms such as hot flashes vaginal dryness joint pain and leg cramps. but the benefits of tamoxifen as a treatment for breast cancer are firmly established and far outweigh the risks.
should i get a mammogram at 18 years old my grandmother had breast cancer should i take action now?
the probability of a teenager getting breast cancer is less than one in a million so there is no need for a mammogram(until age 40). if your grandmother is the only member of your family with breast or ovarian cancer chances are that you have no increased risk for breast cancer as compared to any other woman in the us. nevertheless you are never too young to learn self-examination.
should i get a mammogram at 18 years old my grandmother had breast cancer should i take action now?
a baseline mammogram at 40 is appropriate although in 2011 certain groups stated that it should be at 50. debate continues. in younger women breast ultrasound is the modality of choice if there is a concern. remember to do a monthly self breast exam this way you get to know your breast and can detect changes early. when we think of hereditary breast cancer the person is diagnosed prior to age 50.
should i get a mammogram at 18 years old my grandmother had breast cancer should i take action now?
since your grandmother is a second degree relative (mother is first degree) your risk is not higher than the general population. it's a good idea to start monthly breast self exam so that you become familiar with your own breasts. routine screening mammogram starts at age 40.
should i get a mammogram at 18 years old my grandmother had breast cancer should i take action now?
with that family history you are at average risk and don't need to begin screening until age 40. at your age your risk of breast cancer is so low that the substantially higher false positive rate of either mammo or ultrasound means that screening doesn't make sense.
several of my family members have cancer of colon prostate also lung. i was diagnosed withfibrocystic breast disease. would i be a high risk?
often there are families that have a number of cancer and their is no obvious correlation. fibrocyctic disease makes it harder to examine as the breast seems to be lumpy but does not put you at more risk. if there were first degree (mom or sister) or several second degree relatives with breast cancer you would be higher for breast cancer risk. in that case brac genes can be tested.
should i be concerned about breast cancer when i have milky draininge from my breasts (its not mastitis)? multiple family members had breast cancer
if the drainage is milky (and not bloody or looking like fluid in a blister) it is probably ok especially if you are pre-menopausal. you should probably see a breast speciialist to be sure. if your family history puts you at high enough risk an mri may be a better screening than mammography. look up the gail model on the net to calculate your risk.
should i be concerned about breast cancer when i have milky draininge from my breasts (its not mastitis)? multiple family members had breast cancer
milky discharge is common and doesn't necessarily means you have breast cancer. it could be physiologic side effects from medications or drugs xs stimulation of the nipples a pituitary tumor pregnancy. see your doctor to have it evaluated for cause and of course to rule out cancer. good luck.
should a person with 3 breast cysts non painful get a bioposy done to make sure thers no cancer? i recently had a mammogram then was told i needed a ultra sound i got my results but they say its not cancer how can they know this if a bioposy wasnt done
hi that is a great question. first off breast cysts are very common (especially in middle aged women â€” 40â€™s 50â€™s & 60â€™s). the milk glands in the breast can enlarge over time and develop into a cyst. there can be one cyst or a number of cysts. the cyst can be tiny or large. usually the major source of concern would be if there was a large cyst that was causing the woman physical discomfort. masses that are seen on a mammogram that are suggestive of breast cancer often are calcified and usually are solid. the ultrasound is done to ensure that the cyst only contains fluid and no other materials. unless the cysts contained materials other than fluids a biopsy is normally not necessary. if the cyst is causing discomfort there is an option for aspiration.
so what are the symptoms of metastatic breast cancer?
i would depend on where the metastasis are located and how advanced. initially metastasis to different areas may produce no symptoms. then as they progress problems can develope. in bone you can get pain collapse of a part of the spine if that is involved fractures. in the lung you can become short of breath or develop fluid. in the liver you can develope liver problems. etc.
so what are the symptoms of metastatic breast cancer?
this really depends on the extent and location of the cancer. some patients with bone-only cancer can have no symptoms. others may have general symptoms such as fatigue weight loss poor appetite pain depression and specific symptoms related to cancer sites such as cough nausea vomitting shortness of breath bleeding mental changes etc.
what do you suggest if my girlfriend has breast cancer is it triple negative?
we here could not possibly know if it's triple negative. now if you want to know what to do for someone with 3x neg cancer my advise is that she get a good multidisciplinary team of cancer specialists. she also needs to see a specialist in genetics because triple neg breast patients younger than 60 should be tested for brca and the results may affect the choice of surgery. best 2 both.
what do you suggest if my mom has breast cancer and after some biopsy's and an mri thisfind any spreading in the other breast or liver?
if your mother has breast cancer spread to the opposite breast and to the liver she should be under the care of a qualified medical oncologist and perhaps a surgeon if the disease is limited in the liver. some patients are candidates for surgical resection of liver spread and possibly a mastectomy on the opposite breast.
what do you suggest if my mom has breast cancer and after some biopsy's and an mri this of spreading to the left breast or towards the liver?
gthe primary lesion of breast should be resected and evaluated as to if it is triple neg. and which hormones might be effective if the lesion is er+ or neg. if there is evidence of a second lesion that should also be excised and with evidence of liver involvement chemotherapy whould be added along with agents such as herceptin (trastuzumab) if lesion her2+
what to do if i am here in this radiologist office because i hve do a breast spot compression i'm a bit worried cuz i'm 43 n my sister had breast cancer shld?
the time the radiologist finds a potential abnormality on the screening mammo or an area not well seen requiring extra views to evaluate. 80% of the time this turns out to be nothing of concern. of the remainder that go to biopsy 80% of those turn out benign.
what to do if i am here in this radiologist office because i hve do a breast spot compression i'm a bit worried cuz i'm 43 n my sister had breast cancer shld?
of these 80% need no further treatment except follow up in 6-12 months. of the other 20% less than 25% have a positive biopsy result. best wishes.
what do you suggest if my mum died of breast cancer will my sister have the gene?
most breast cancers are not caused by an inherited mutation in a gene like brca ("the gene"). you should talk to your family doc or gyn and see if they recommend a consultation with a specialist in risk assessment and cancer genetics. best to you and be safe.
what happens if you were stricken with breast cancer would you still move?
early breast cancer is curable and should not affect your mobility (provided there is no complication related to the treatment). even advanced cancer patients can do fairly well. someone who is tremendously debilitated by the cancer or the treatment or who has spinal or bone damage or perhaps has terrible pain may become bedfast. one of our goals as oncologists is to avoid that if possible.
what do you suggest if my mom has a grade 3 stage 2 her 2 breast cancer how deadly is this what is the chances of survival?
stage 2 breast cancer is cancer which has spread to the lymph nodes of the armpit. after surgery most patients benefit from adjuvant therapy. that is treatment given to prevent recurrence. depending on details of case that may be hormonal therapy or chemotherapy. her2 positive patients also benefit from herceptin (trastuzumab) to prevent recurrence. many but alas not all patients are cured.
what do you suggest if my mate told me last year that she had breast cancer. a few months ago she said she had the all clear. can you get breast cancer but not?
it is well recognzied that most tumors arise in a field effect and when the lesion is completely removed there is always a potential for a new lesion to occur. with 3d high resolution mammo one can detect the earliest lsion and recurrence that can be removed locally. the incidence of a new primary after treating a breast cancer successfully is 1% per year for at least 15 yrs.
what do you suggest if my fibroadenomas are not moving. as i heard normally these are movable?
a breast cancer expert can guide you better so seek consultation and full evaluation with him/her to make sure that your tumor is not cancerous. a biopsy may be needed as that is the only certain way to confirm exact diagnosis.
what happens if my friend has breast cancer and results of a biopsy of her thyroid shows cancer what's her prognosis?
hi. the breast cancer and thyroid cancer are probably unrelated. i've never seen breast cancer metastasize to thyroid. thyroid cancer generally has a high cure rate. it's not fair she's had these cancers but life isn't fair. i bet the thyroid cancer with treatment will go well. i hope the breast cancer is in remission. she might outlive us all! <positive_smiley>
will chemotherapy for breast cancer have any effect on functioning of a vp shunt?
no. chemotherapy does not have an affect on the functioning of ventriculoperitoneal shunt. infection and other medical problems can bring out the symptoms of hydrocephalus and it may appear that the shunt has malfunctioned but that is often not the case. remain focused on beating the cancer and all the best to you.
when doctors say ductal carcinoma in situ what does "in situ" mean?
ductal carcinoma in situ (dcis) of the breast is a breast cancer which has started in the ducts of milk glands (as most breast cancers do) but not yet invaded beyond that into the fat of the breast. untreated it has a high likelihood of becoming invasive breast cancer a potentially fatal disease. treated dcis has a high cure rate. some with dcis benefit from taking med to prevent 2nd cancer.
what is the survival rate for breast cancer stage 3c? right breast mastectomy done with auxillary clearance. er/pr is +ve and her2 is -ve. suggested with 6 rounds chemo and radiation therapy.
for something as personal as this this should really be answered or discussed with your oncologist. your information is helpful but there are so many more details that need to be known that can't be discussed here. good luck.
what is the survival rate for breast cancer stage 3c? right breast mastectomy done with auxillary clearance. er/pr is +ve and her2 is -ve. suggested with 6 rounds chemo and radiation therapy.
stage 3 ten year overall survival is about 60%.
what could a painful breast lump in an 18 year old be? family history or breast and ovarian cancer
you've noticed a painful lump how long has it been there? what day of your cycle are you on? have you had this complaint before? do you drink caffeine? is there a family histroy =of breast cancer? is the area hot? red? does it involve the nipple or nipple discharge? at your age the most likely cause would be fibrocystic disease which can cuase painful lumps especially due to certain foods and c
what could a painful breast lump in an 18 year old be? family history or breast and ovarian cancer
most likely it is a fibroadenoma fibrocystic breast tissue or a cyst. however if there is a family history of breast or ovarian cancer you should rule out breast cancer
what do you suggest if my great-grandmother grandmother and mom had breast cancer and i'm scared i'm going to get it?
comprehensive risk profile performed. if you are a brca carrier or are otherwise at very high risk you may be a candidate to begin early screening. speak with your doctor about it.
what do you suggest if my sister is 53 years old and was diagnosed with stage 4 breast cancer five years ago. for years the cancer w?
stage 4 breast can be controlled with systemic therapy very well even for more than 5 years. this is most commonly seen in patients who have stage 4 disease because of spread to the bone only as opposed to the liver brain lungs etc. regardless women are living longer with stage 4 breast cancer because of better systemic treatment. while cancer well controlled with chemo patients will live.
what do you suggest if my mom has breast cancer i have a question?
your specific question here on healthtap.
what happens if you're at high risk for breast cancer but don't have it would the surgery be completely out of pocket?
with mammorgraphy as accurate as it is in detecting pre malignant lesions of the breast and further evaluation by physical exam and breast mri there would not be much value as some have considered in doing a prophylactic bilateral mastectomy with reconstruction. i know of no plans that cover such surgical procedures.
what to do if i am prone to having skin cancer. but if i get skin cancer on my breast or even in my breasts a little does that also count as breast cancer?
skin cancer on your breast is still skin cancer.
what to do if i am prone to having skin cancer. but if i get skin cancer on my breast or even in my breasts a little does that also count as breast cancer?
skin cancer on the breast is still skin cancer. histologically it is completely different than breast cancer.
what happens if an ultrasound scan seems clear is it possible that a mammogram will still show a problem?
the mammogram is the gold standard for breast cancer screening. only a mammogram can discover microcalcifications which may be the only sign of early breast cancer. a few patients avoid mammograms fearful that the brief compression hurts. remember the discomfort is only a few seconds and is performed to decrease the radiation and better evaluate the tissue. ultrasound is an adjunct test.
what do you suggest if my mother is 56 she is diagnosed with breast cancer with bone disease. pls help with best treatment info?
an oncologist can help decide if the cell type of breast cancer may respond to chemotherapy as there are several types of breast cancer. ask if there is a multidisciplinary team (several different specialists with interest in breast cancer) in your area that may discuss optimal treatment.
what do you suggest if my mom has her2 breast cancer stage 1 grade 3 how good is her chance of living?
all stage i breast cancers have a good prognosis when curative treatment is given. her2+ status influences the choice of chemotherapy which would include a drug called herceptin (trastuzumab) that basically acts to 'block' her2 receptors on the tumor.
what to do do inflammatory breast cancer or something else! please anyone have these symptoms?
if you have redness / thickening of a portion of your breast or a dominant mass in the breast get right to a competent practitioner who can proceed with the workup and probable biopsy. don't even stop on the internet to ask whether anyone else shares your symptoms or what to do. be brave. take charge. think of how many people love you. use this chance to -- likely -- save your life.
what happens if breast cancer spreads to other organs and is unoperable does it leave some kind of marks on the body?
to the skin would be very unusual. the mets are usually to internal organs.
what happens if breast cancer spreads to other organs and is unoperable does it leave some kind of marks on the body?
metastasize to the skin as can melanoma and gi cancers.
what to do if i am thinking about getting a breast augmentation(too young)?
thirty-eight is not too young for a breast augmentation but age alone is not the only consideration. prior hsitory of surgery or family history of breast cancer childbearing plans weight gain/loss hormonal status and so many other issues may factor into whether you are an acceptable candidate. it would be best to meet with a board certified plastic surgeon to discuss this decision.
will taking fenugreek (one capsule of 610mg per day) lead to overdose of oestrogen and cause breast cancer? esp when my mom has history of cancer.
fenugreek is used for many conditions but so far there isn’t enough scientific evidence to determine whether or not it is effective for any of them. it is possibly safe when taken in amounts used for medicinal purposes (amounts larger than normally found in food) for up to 6 months. at this time there is not enough scientific information to determine an appropriate range of doses for fenugreek.
what are the real causes of breast cancer? who should be afraid?
there are risk factors that increase the risk of breast cancer. dr. bauer expertly listed those factors so i won't go over it again. just wanted to say that fear serves no purpose other than ruining your life. be aware be alert be informed but do not live in fear.
what are the real causes of breast cancer? who should be afraid?
established risk factors include: female gender age family history genetics personal history of breast cancer radiation t chest/face prior to age 30 prior history of certain benign breast lesions white women overweight not having a full term pregnancy by age 30 and others. refer to <link> for more detail. this reflects the large amount of research done.
what is occult breast cancer what is survival rate of woman older than 60 who have occult breast cancer?
there is formally no such condition called occult breast cancer. please give details of exactly where is your breast cancer located and how was it found in the first place? . i am wondering if you are talking about dcis or a lymph node metastases in the arm pit but no detectable primary tumor. please elaborate further.
what is occult breast cancer what is survival rate of woman older than 60 who have occult breast cancer?
is breast cancer found just by nodal metastasis - without clinically evident disease in the breast. there is huge variability in survival depending on tumor biology and extent of disease - so need more info.
what is occult breast cancer what is survival rate of woman older than 60 who have occult breast cancer?
is breast cancer that first shows up as metastatic disease usually axillary lymph nodes but the site of origin of the cancer in the breast cannot be identified. the overall 10 year survival is about 50-70% although i am not sure how it breaks down by age.
women under 40 with breast cancer have a lower survival rate than older women?
the hormone levels of a younger woman are high and can affect the breast cancer and treatments. the behavior of cancers in younger people in general behave more aggressively because the blood supply metabolism etc are more active in younger people. it depends upon the biology of the tumor the staging the genetics. early detection is a major factor in long term survival.
what do you suggest if my wife was just diagnosed with invasive ductal carcinoma stage 2 breast cancer. can anyone share some info?
get oncology consult. either ucsf / uc davis or stanford.
what is ocult breast cancer?
cancer detected outside the breast(for example in an axillary lymph node) in which the presumptive primary cancer within the breast cannot be detected by standard clinical and imaging methods. not very common accounts for less than 1% of breast cancers.
what is ocult breast cancer?
detection of occult tumor cells in blood bone marrow or lymph nodes by molecular technique that usually can not be detected by imaging or standard immunochemistry in patients with breast cancer.
what are the chances of a 23yo female gettin breast cancer?
unless you have something called brca 1 or 2 or have another ca genetic issue the chances are extremely remote. still see your gyn for examination especially if you feel a lump.
what are the chances of a 23yo female gettin breast cancer?
risk of breast cancer increases with age. the life time risk for all women in the us is 1 in 8. i couldn't find a risk statistic for women under 30. in a 30 year woman the risk was 1 in 227. unless you have other risk factors that substantially increase your risk you are unlikely to have breast cancer at age 23.
what are the chances of a 23yo female gettin breast cancer?
it is uncommon to get breast cancer in your 20's and if you do it is almost always because of one of the genetic mutations such as brca.
will an ultrasound determine if i have breast cancer? how does cancer shape differ than fibre in the breast? i have pcos & hormones aren't stable.
detect suspicious lesions that might be breast cancer. when ultrasound detects a suspicious lesion however biopsy is necessary to confirm the diagnosis. ultrasound alone can only estimate the probability that a lesion might be malignant.
will an ultrasound determine if i have breast cancer? how does cancer shape differ than fibre in the breast? i have pcos & hormones aren't stable.
u/s determines whether it's cystic or solid. if solid biopsy is the definitive method of diagnosis. if cystic the aspiration or watching is indicated with rexamination.
what to do about nipple infection or breast cancer?
start for either of these conditions is with a medical evaluation.

both sides of your family history are important. take care!
what are the odds of having stage 2b invasive ductal carcinoma her2 positive breast cancer and papillary thyroid cancer at age 40?
but it is still possible to have both. risk of having papillary thyroid before forty is about 13/100 000. risk of having breast ca is about 11/100 000. the overlap of the two independent events is slightly less than 1 in a million.
what to do if i get inverted nipple discharge 24/7 should this be a concern for doctor to evaluate(age17)?
reasons for nipple discharge can include stimulation of the breast pregnancy medications galactorrhea (secretion of milk or similar substance) an abscess or other breast infection hormonal imbalances (like hypothyroidism) fibrocystic breasts (breasts are very fibrous) blocked mammary duct breast cancer and intraductal papilloma (non cancerous mass) use of marijuana anise and fennel.
what does it mean if i tested her2-positive for breast cancer?
her2 is a gene present in many cells that sends control signals causing the cells to grow divide and make repairs. a normal breast cell has 2 copies of the her2 gene. certain breast cancers start when a cell has more than 2 copies of that gene and start over-producing the her2 protein. the involved tumor cells grow and divide more quickly. these tumor cells are sensitive to herceptin (trastuzumab).
what are the differences between a nipple infection and breast cancer?
infection is due usually to bacteria. cancer is a disorder of cell growth. if you have any concern about having either please see your doctor as an examination is need to tell the difference.
what to do about nipple discharge very worried please please i need help and advice i'm very frightened!?

what are the chances that i've got breast cancer? how common is it?
the incidence of breast cancer in the us england and australia is about 1 in 7 based on better than 80% of patients deriving their growth from the mmtv virus entering the wnt-1 gene the virus started in england during the middle ages and spread via mice on the ships to the new world if mammo neg. then the chance of a lesion present is extremely slight. monthly breast self exam important.
women that don't have children have a relative risk of 1. 6 - 1. 9 of getting breast cancer. what does this actually mean though?
seems to reduce your risk. if the average risk is 1 those who never had children or breast fed are 1. 6-1. 9 times more likely to get breast cancer. another way to look at this is to call breast feeding a treatment. those who "receive" it (i. e breast feed) are 1/1. 9 or 50 percent less likely to get breast cancer.

don't know your gender? reasons for nipple discharge can include stimulation of the breast pregnancy medications galactorrhea (secretion of milk or similar substance) an abscess or other breast infection hormonal imbalances (like hypothyroidism) fibrocystic breasts (breasts are very fibrous) blocked mammary duct breast cancer and intraductal papilloma (non cancerous mass) use of marijuana
what are the most common places to get cancer after having breast cancer?
the first site of spread for most breast cancers especially if axillary dissection not performed is to axillary nodes. following this osseous metastasis is frequent followed by lung and liver. the earlier the disease the better the chance that metastasis will not have occurred.
should both mammogram and sonogram be done forlarge breasts?
if the breast tissue is dense it is often helpful to perform a directed-sonogram with a clinical breast exam and mammogram. on the other hand mri is also useful in the setting of increased risk of breast cancer or if the mammogram and sonogram aren't helpful.
should both mammogram and sonogram be done forlarge breasts?
hello t0myy322. i am not sure what your question is but mammography is the generally accepted standard for radiographic screening for breast cancer. breast size should not matter. ultrasound is not appropriate for screening but can be used if a specific area of the breast is of concern. mri is also used under certain circumstances.
something hurts near my right breast. can it be a breast cancer?
most things that cause pain tend to be benign and most of the bad things (i. e. cancer) are unlikely to produce pain until they become advanced and obvious. that being said if there is a symptom that persists and produces concern see your doctor for further evaluation.
something hurts near my right breast. can it be a breast cancer?
breast cancer is usually not painful although that should not be taken as a fact in all cases. advanced breast cancer of course can be very painful. pain is usually associated with fibrocystic changes in the breast which are found in almost half of all women. they are not thought to raise your risk of breast cancer. get checked.
should i have genetic testing for breast cancer if family history?
if in doubt go to a genetics counselor - most cancer centers have one. the consultation is not expensive but the test itself is. they will ask about your age the exact numbers of family members affected their age at diagnosis whether one or both breasts their relationship to you (mother sister or daughter increase your personal risk) other cancers in the family. then they can advise you.
should i have genetic testing for breast cancer if family history?
the risk factor/indications for genetic testing are: multiple family members with a history of breast cancer bilateral breast cancer male breast cancer ovarian cancer ashkenazi jewish heritage young age of diagnosis (<50 but really premenopausal particular early 40s-30s) triple negative (er/pr/her2-) status and age <60.
should somebody with a family history of breast cancer be more adamant about examination early in life?
hx evidence does not support early mammo's and they add radiation exposure. adamant or not the yield is so low that the risk outweighs it. it it were risk free and cheap and there are ultrasound devices in development that might do this there might be a case.
should somebody with a family history of breast cancer be more adamant about examination early in life?
you need to know who in the family has breast cancer and at what age. first degree relatives (mother father sister grandmother) and very important. do not forget your father's side of family. breast self exam is important for every women. i advocate breast self exam for young women so they can develop good habits.
should i get a genetic test if breast cancer runs in my family in aunts and cousins?
in general we look most closely at first-degree relatives (mom sister daughter) but it is still pertinent especially if they are young. it is always best to have the members of your family who have had breast cancer get the brca test first. if they are brca(+) you can get tested for that specific mutation at a much lower cost; if they are(-) your family can feel comfortable about their risks.
should i get a genetic test if breast cancer runs in my family in aunts and cousins?
first find a genetic counselor or a high risk breast specialist. they can assess your risk. a lot depends on the number of second order relatives their ages at diagnosis whether any were bilateral - and any other cancers in your family -especially ovarian colon or uterine. the office visit is not too expensive but the actual test is.
should i get a genetic test if breast cancer runs in my family in aunts and cousins?
perhaps yes. but before you do the test you should have a detail discussion re - what is your risk for certain cancers- what kind of genetic testing needed how to interprete the result what the consequencies of the test are etc- those above are things you should discuss either wih your oncologist or with a genetic counsellor. discuss with your oncologist in detail.
should axillary sentinel node biopsy be done after chemotherapy?
sentinel lymph node biopsy is usually done at the time of lumpectomy for breast cancer. the information gained is used in the decision making as to whether adjuvant chemotherapy should be given to increase the likelihood of cure. rarely it might be done after chemotherapy if the initial role of chemo was to shrink the tumor to allow surgery (neoadjuvant chemotherapy).
should i consider breast reconstruction after masectomy?
breast reconstruction surgery is a common surgical practice to help restore and recreate a woman's breasts following a mastectomy for breast cancer. surgical techniques may use implants or a patient's own tissue to recreate the breast. also most women don't realize that breast reconstruction is covered by health insurance rather than being a cosmetic operation you would have to pay for.
signs/symptoms of breast cancer?
not previously felt inverted nipple change in skin at nipple/areola skin with appearance of orange skin lump in the arm pit. pain is not a common feature of breast cancer. first degree relative is a signal to be alert.
signs/symptoms of breast cancer?
breast cancer may present as a painless firm breast lump. rarely changes in color of the skin sometimes nipple will get retracted or breast skin pulled inward. best is to have yearly physical examination and mammogram after age 40 before these symptoms occur. any breast lump painful or not should be examined by your doctor.
stage 3 breast cancer her2 positive how many herceptin (trastuzumab) cycle she must undergo?
herceptin (trastuzumab) can be given together with initial chemotherapy for the first 4-6 months then subsequently by itself for a total of 1 year. if chemotherapy was given first without herceptin (trastuzumab) then herceptin (trastuzumab) can be given for a full year by itself. the usual cycle runs every 3 weeks (17-18 cycles in one full year).
stage 3 breast cancer her2 positive how many herceptin (trastuzumab) cycle she must undergo?
the standard of care for stage 1 2 3 breast cancer is a year of herceptin (trastuzumab). it is probably the most important drug in her 2 positive breast cancer!
sore breasts two weeks after period and not pregnant.?
its not uncommon to develop sore breasts (mastalgia). this happens in response to changes in hormone levels such as your period. it has nothing to do with breast cancer. avoid caffeine and take 400 iu of vitamin e.
should women over 70 years old continue to have mammograms and pelvic exams.?
mammograms should be continued until about the age of 85. the best chance for detecting breast cancer is the mammogram. pelvic exams are important until about that same age as the risk for ovarian cancer is greatest at the ages of 60 to 80. the best chance for detecting ovarian cancer is the pelvic exam.
sore breast blue veins. could it be sign of breast cancer?
these are not common symptoms of breast can. it would also be exceedingly rare of a 19 year old to get breast cancer.
sore breast blue veins. could it be sign of breast cancer?
typical symptoms can include a breast lump or hardness change is size or shape of breast inverted nipple peeling of the nipple or breast skin changes of breast skin into a pitting nature like an orange peel and bloody discharge from the nipple. soreness of breast and enhanced look to the breast in a 21 year old female can be common especially around the menstrual period.
sore breast blue veins. could it be sign of breast cancer?
my first guess is that if the veins are prominent it's mondor's and benign. please do visit your physician now.
sore breast blue veins. could it be sign of breast cancer?
i am amazed about how often i have women ask me about the veins on their breast. occasionally they are spider veins but mostly they are blue veins. these are usually normal findings and normal variations of chest veins. they tend to be more pronounced in fair skinned females. occasionally new breast formation may be a sign of an underlying mass. see a vein specialist for an evaluation.
stage iv metastatic breast cancer and pleural effusion. what is treatment?
breast cancers come in many "flavors" and this will determine the treatment. usually it's a form of chemotherapy given by mouth or by vein. xeloda is given by mouth and there are many intravenous chemotherapies. sometimes hormone blocking medications are very effective if the cancer has the estrogen or progesterone receptor on its surface. herceptin (trastuzumab) is useful if it has her2 on its surface.
stage iv metastatic breast cancer and pleural effusion. what is treatment?
pleural effusion is fluid that collects in the cavity that holds the lungs. when fluid builds up it can prevent the lung from expanding fully so you can breathe. worst case scenario is the lung can collapse. a special tube can be placed in the chest to drain this fluid. you should be working closely with your oncologist and a thoracic surgeon.
stage iv metastatic breast cancer and pleural effusion. what is treatment?
breast cancer is best treated with multi-discipline approach. the effusion should be drained and analyzed. if the effusion contains malignant cells or is suspicious for malignancy there are different techniques that may be employed to prevent recurrence and potentially guide further therapy. it is important to discuss this condition with a thoracic surgeon.
screening for breast cancer--need latest us recommendations and rationale?
form age 35 (in suspicious group ) to 40 yrs and on regular breast examination by the physician monthly self examination annual mammography if needed sonography some times mri core needle biopsy of suspicious dencities. genetic study ( braca i & ii ) if there is strong family history.
screening for breast cancer--need latest us recommendations and rationale?
we agree with the american cancer society guidelines of your first mammogram at age 35. this would be as a baseline and to determine your breast tissue density. this is being recognized as a risk factor on its own and in conjunction with your family history and history of exposure to estrogen can be used to plan future mammograms and breast ultrasounds.
survival various types breast cancer?
survival depends on many factors such as overall health age stage of disease and response to treatment. additional information may be found at www. cancer. org.
survival various types breast cancer?
breast cancers are staged based upon the size of the cancer lymph node or distant organ involvement direct extension to the skin or chest wall muscles and unique molecular features of the tumor. published rates of 5-yr survival (<link> cancer. org/cancer/breastcancer/detailedguide/breast-cancer-survival-by-stage) vary quite a bit based on these variables between 15%-93%.
signs and symptoms for early breast tumor/breast cancer?
most early breast cancers are identified by screening mammography before symptoms develop. the most common symptom is of a palpable breast mass identified by self-examination. other less common symptoms include nipple discharge breast pain skin dimpling nipple inversion or any change in one breast. mammograms are not perfect but they have been proven life-savers-please begin at age 40.
signs and symptoms for early breast tumor/breast cancer?
early breast tumors/cancer are usually silent- no pain skin discoloration mass weight loss. bloody or clear nipple discharge can result from a small early tumor and needs evaluation. unless very superficial or in small breasts lumps less than 1 cm are difficult to feel. in older women over 40 mammograms may detect early cancers and tumors. mri and ultrasound are also used.
signs and symptoms for early breast tumor/breast cancer?
there are usually no signs or symptoms for early breast cancer. it is important to perform your breast cancer screening as recommended by your physician. the best chance for a cure is with early detection.
someone i know had breast cancer about 3 years ago. within the past year the cancer spread to the spine and liver. what is the prognosis?
this depends on her response to treatment and her overall health. the average 5 year overall survival for someone with stage iv breast cancer is 15%.
someone i know had breast cancer about 3 years ago. within the past year the cancer spread to the spine and liver. what is the prognosis?
when the cancer spreads beyond the primary organ- here- is breast- ; it is considered to be a stage iv disease. it is treatable- however it is incurable. statistically the 5 year survival in stage iv breast cancer is approximately 20 %.
someone i know had breast cancer about 3 years ago. within the past year the cancer spread to the spine and liver. what is the prognosis?
breast cancer that spreads to bone(the spine) is usually "end stage" disease. it then becomes a "matter of time"".
should i get a mammogram i'm 27 and i been having pain in one of my breast and its usually off and on but it goes away but lately it hurts more?
at your age it is usually not cancer rather hormonal imbalances but better safe than sorry especially if you have a family history of breast cancer or other problems.
should i be concerned if i have a family history of breast cancer?
first degree relatives (mother sister daughter) of patients with breast cancer are at increased risk for developing cancer. more distant relatives have a risk similar to that of us population.
should i be concerned if i have a family history of breast cancer?
you should see your gynecologist or primary care physician to determine the strength of your family history.
should i be concerned if i have a family history of breast cancer?
a family history of breast cancer significantly increases the risk to other family members. a geneticist or an oncologist can give an idea of how much risk there is to family members and suggest surveillance strategies and possibly treatment alternatives.
should i be concerned if i have a family history of breast cancer?
most women overestimate their family risk of breast cancer--85-90% of breast ca cases are not hereditary. if your mother sister or daughter had breast (or ovarian) ca esp before age 40 this warrants further evaluation. this is best determined by genetic counseling followed by brca testing (the gene responsible for many hereditary breast cancers) ideally starting w/affected family members.
should i be concerned if i have a family history of breast cancer?
if you have a close relative with breast cancer you will be at higher risk. an oncologist can help you determine that risk.
should i feel pain during the early stages of breast cancer?
most early stage breast cancers present as a painless lump. but pain itself does not mean much. it is the presence of a lump when you feel your breast with the flat part of your fingers that should alert you to a possibility of breast cancer. any lump means that you need to see your doctor for examination in order to confirm it and guide you further.
should i feel pain during the early stages of breast cancer?
breast cancer is not usually associated with breast pain. the most common cause of breast discomfort is a benign fibrocystic breast condition. if you have breast changes or concerns you must see your doctor for an exam.
should someone go through chemotherapy if she has breast cancer?
as with most other cancers it depends on many factors but it would be safe to say that in certain situations chemo is an integral part of the treatment for breast cancer. you need to talk to an oncogist about it. the goals of therapy should justify the potential toxicity. best regards.
should someone go through chemotherapy if she has breast cancer?
would need to have much more information on the type & stage of breast cancer. all this information helps the medical oncologist work with the patient to determine what treatments are most likely to be needed helpful & successful. you need to discuss this with your oncologist.
stage 2 breast cancer at 87 years old. is it recommended that i go through surgery?
there are many questions that need to be answered: are there any health issues that make surgery and anesthesia a high risk? how big is tumor? is the tumor er or pr positive? i recommend you fined a breast surgeon that works in a multidisciplanary team to help provide education and options. breast care in individualized for each unique patient.
stage 2 breast cancer at 87 years old. is it recommended that i go through surgery?
it depends on your general health and functional status. if you have no other medical problems like heart disease diabetes or serious medical conditions then surgery is a good option( if your expected survival is more than 5 years/this depends on your general health). but there are also other ways to treat breast cancer like radiotherapy and hormonal medicines which can often control cancer
stage 2 breast cancer at 87 years old. is it recommended that i go through surgery?
if you are in good enough condition to safely undergo surgery and therefore healthy enough to expect to live another five years or so then a small lumpectomy or local surgery can be curative. if it is hormonally sensitive then hormonal therapy may be an alternative. radiation without surgery is palliative only. if u r on dialysis or have severe cardiac disease or otherwise poor health ask doc.
symptoms of breast cancer?
early breast cancer has no signs or symptoms. breast cancer may later present as a painless firm breast lump. rarely changes in color of the skin sometimes nipple will get retracted or breast skin pulled inward. best is to have yearly physical examination and mammogram after age 40 before these symptoms occur. any breast lump painful or not should be examined by your doctor.
symptoms of breast cancer?
breast cancer does not always have symptoms. when it does there may be a non tender lump in the breast dimpling of the skin inversion of the nipple bloody nipple discharge or sore lymph nodes in the underarm. when breast cancer has spread it can lead to symptoms in the areas of spread. for example a patient with bone metastasis may experience bone pain.
symptoms of breast cancer?
proper screening with self breast exams looking for new lumps breast exams by your physician looking for skin or nipple chanes as well as masses or lymph nodes and mammogram and ultrasound if needed are the best ways to pick up early stage breast cancer before it causes any symptoms. once advanced it can cause many different symptoms throughout the body.
should i go see my doctor if i think i might have breast cancer?
over the age of 40 you should have annual mammograms and annual doctor exam of your breasts. you should perform monthly self breast exam as well. if you still concerned about your breast health in between your routine doctor visits and routine screening tests then you should see your doctor anyway.

yes.
what are your treatment options for er pr positive breast cancer?
stage at diagnosis (tumor size lymph nodes involved is it early stage etc. ) biological factors (her-2 +/- gene profile -oncotypedx) your age and health and your understanding of benefit/risk of treatment options and other factors all are considered in decision making. list can be: surgery radiation anti-estrogen pills chemo- & biological therapies bone building drugs and clinical trials
what are the chances of breast cancer spreading to other parts of the body?
breast cancer like all malignancies is programmed to spread. when first appearing as a lesion growing out of the milk duct it remains in-situ for a period of time because clones or populations that spread havnt formed. as early mutations occur new populations of cells will leave the primary to spread so that the rule is: the earlier the diagnosis the better the chance of cure.
what tests are used for screening for breast cancer?
the best screening procedure for breast cancer is breast palpation. to pick up the earliest lesions mammography is the best procedure with improved digital and 3d formats. this is followed by sonography to define a localized site in thickened breast tissue and tell whether a lesion has fluid. for a more detailed study mri of the breast can detect many lesions not seen on mammo.
what is the youngest age that you can get breast cancer at?
since it takes many hits and time for a cell to transform breast cancer is most frequent over the age of 40. with braca mutations congenital breast malignancies can develop under the age of 20. any mass appearing in a young womans breast must be evaluated as a fibroadenoma or developing malignancy. patients without braca have been seen as young as 17 y. o.
what is the youngest age at which you can get breast cancer?
to my knowledge the youngest breast cancer patient was a toddler. however in general most females are diagnosed with breast cancer after the age of 40 which is one reason why we generally recommend screening mammograms starting at age 40. the exception are breast cancer mutation carriers who commonly develop breast cancer in their 20's-30's and require earlier screening/prevention efforts.
what is the youngest age that you can get breast cancer at?
any age is possible for breast cancer though it would be rare in children. it is more common as you age and with certain risk factors such as genetic propensity obesity with overly large breasts smokers radiation exposure and other factors
what are phytoestrogens? do they cause or prevent breast cancer?
phytoestrogens are chemicals in plants that bind to the estrogen receptor (er). they can stimulate or block the receptor. soy beans and flax seeds contain phytoestrogens. women in asian countries who eat a lot of soy have a lower chance of getting breast cancer so it may be preventive. but studies are conflicting. i tell my patients with er+ breast cancer not to overdose on soy or flaxseed.
what exactly is breast cancer? what causes it?
breast cancer is a malignancy that most often develops in the duct cells of breast tissue. less frequently it appears from lobules at the terminal duct responsible for milk production. the most common cause is environmental with a virus such as mmtv entering the wnt-1 gene of the duct cell to produce b catenin which helps convert the cell possibly with ebv to the malignant phenotype.
will plan b increase my breast cancer risk?
plan b one-step is a type of emergency contraception. this is birth control that can prevent pregnancy after unprotected sex. it is not as effective as regular contraception and is not meant to be taken it as your main form of birth control. as a result you should not be exposed to levonorgestrel chronically unless it is used in your oral contraceptive pills.
will plan b increase my breast cancer risk?
plan b intended for one time use only a emergency measure to prevent pregnancy after the incident such single use will not result in cancer and other complication. but if is misused as substitute for contraceptives ( multiple use ) hormone progestin is know to cause several blood problems clotting embolism including cancers. see you doctor for safe contraceptive measures.
what does the pain from bone metastases feel like what other symptoms are there and any specific to metastases from breast cancer?
pain from bone metastases is typically persistent and tends to get worse with time. other symptoms may be in the form of fatigue and sometimes weight loss due to progressive cancer.
what does the pain from bone metastases feel like what other symptoms are there and any specific to metastases from breast cancer?
pain associated with osseous metastasis is common. for the most part the small lytic lesion associated with breast metastasis is aymptomatic until the lesion enlarges and expands rib or vertebral body so there is stretching of the periosteum. percussion over site can initiate symptoms which respond to chemo and rt-now localized cyberknife treatment.
what kind of breast implants are safest?
both silicone and saline implants are safe. neither increases the risk of breast cancer. silicone gel implants are gelatinous (gummy bear) implants that do not leak if ruptured. they are more commonly used today. liquid silicone implants may rupture and leak but leakage has not been clearly linked to subsequent disease.
what does breast cancer feel like? is it painful?
most malignant lesions of the breast can be felt at 1/2 cm. in size. palpation of breast with hand behind head on side of palpation using opposite hand with fingers moving in a clockwise direction will detect a firm solitary mass different than any other lesions or lumps. the mass is very firm and non tender. should be biopsied even if not detected on follow up mammo.
what is the typical life expectancy for a young stage 4 breast cancer patient in great condition on afinitor (everolimus) and aromasin?
in one of the trials the median survival was 31 months. this means that half of the people who took this combination lived more than this. so it is easy to live 3-4 yrs in the above mentioned condition.
what is the survival rate for a 46 yr old pt with stage 2b invasive lobular breast cancer w/node involvement?
invasive lobular carcinoma begins in the milk-producing glands (lobules) of the breast the cells having broken out of the lobule where they began and in stage iib have spread to regional lymph nodes. it typically doesn't form a lump but often causes a fullness in one part of the breast. they tend to have more hormone-receptor–positive tumors lower nuclear grade and survival better than 85%
what does breast cancer feel like? is it painful?
it takes at many years for a breast cancer to reach 1cm about 1/2inch. early detection is very important; yearly screening mammogram starting at the age of 40 monthly self breast exam and yearly physical exam by your doctor is recommended to detect early stages of breast cancer with excellent prognosis. palpable breast cancer is painless firm usually is not moveable with retraction of skin.
what is the survival rate for a 46 yr old pt with stage 2b invasive lobular breast cancer w/node involvement?
the exact answer to this question depends on a number of factors: actual tumor size level of estrogen expression number of nodes involved medications given and individual response to medications. lifestyle factors are also key. 80% 5-year survival comes from pooled data from a variety of patients. it's best to ask you medical oncologist to calculate your survival based upon your personal data
what is the likelihood of pregnancy for a young woman receiving breast cancer treatment?
on treatments if receiving only local radiation ovulating woman can get pregnant if receiving chemotherapy will not ovulate most of the time will be permanently sterile speak to your doctor
what are the differences between breast cancer and lung cancer?
breast cancer and lung cancer arise from different parts of the body. breast cancer almost always arises from the ducts of the breast. lung cancer usually arises from the lining of the lung. the two cancer have different natural histories. breast cancer may metastasize or spread to other part of the body including the lungs
when is breast cancer awareness month?
october is the breast cancer awareness month. just remember every woman should make every month a breast cancer awareness month for herself and her loved ones.
what would cause a woman to go from normal periods to constantly bleeding for three months and cramps occasionally nauseous large mass right breast?
the possibility of breast cancer must be considered. and with all that vaginal bleeding you probably have or will soon develop iron deficiency anemia. this will not get better by itsel. see a doctor pronto.
when was breast cancer first discovered?
the most ancient medical writers mention it as something that is already familiar.
when a woman beats breast cancer does she always lose a breast?
mastectomy or surgical removal of the breast is one of the options of treatment of breast cancer. however a good number of breast cancers can be treated with consideration of breast conservation. in these instances a portion of the breast involved by cancer is removed and additional supplementary treatments such as radiation is usually utilized.
why do we give anti-estrogen drugs to post-menopausal women with breast cancer?
anti-estrogen drugs are given to both premenopausal and postmenopausal women whose cancer is estrogen receptor-positive or progesterone receptor-positive. these cancer may grow when exposed to estrogen. anti-estrogen medications block or reduce estrogen that is normally produced by the ovaries in premenopausal women or by fat cells liver adrenal glands or other organs in postmenopausal women.
when should someone have breast reconstruction?
breast reconstruction is most commonly performed after mastectomy or lumpectomy for breast cancer. for years delayed reconstruction was the norm. that meant women underwent their mastectomy recovered and then came back months or years later for reconstruction. today we are seeing more and more immediate reconstructions this is when women have their reconstruction at the initial operation.
where can you get herceptin (trastuzumab)?
herceptin (trastuzumab) is a prescription medication that prescribed by a medical oncologist for breast cancers that are her2/neu positive or her2/neu amplified. it is administered intravenously and is not available over the counter.
what is longterm prognosis for grade 3 stage 1b triple positive breast cancer double mastectomy and 6 treatments of tch with one year of herceptin (trastuzumab)?
exact prognosis is not possible but your oncologist should discuss your prognosis with based on population statistics such as adjuvant! online or better still your oncotype dx score based on the gene profile of your cancer.
what is the life expectancy of a 54yr woman with stage 4 breast cancer metastasized to bones brain and spinal fluid? brca2 positive
it depends on treatment so far. . this is not a good prognosis. it is all about managing quality of life and options. no one knows of course life expectancy but in my opinion quality of life is most important
when should i get my first breast ultrasound? what age is appropriate?
diagnostic ultrasound (us) is performed to evaluate a specific breast symptom (e. g. lump) and may be performed at any age. screening us is performed to detect cancer in women with no breast symptoms and should be performed in combination with annual mammograms (mg) beginning at age 40. mg still remains very important for detection of some small breast cancers that can easily be missed by us.
when was breast cancer awareness month started?
national breast cancer awareness month was established in 1985. the aim of the month is to encourage the use of mammograms to increase the rate of earlier detection.
what can cause the areola to start to spread out into one breast suddenly for one month? it's the breast where i had recent abnormal mammo 6 month fu
do you think it is bruising from your recent mammogram? if not please have your doc look at it and examine your breast. some less common breast cancers can present with odd symptoms
what do the different stages of breast cancer mean?
is typically categorized into various stages. a complete diagnostic evaluation is needed to determine a cancer's stage. criteria are the size of the primary tumor the involvement of regional lymph nodes invasion into tissue outside the breast or more distant metastasis. staging systems are usually numbered i-iv with various subdivisions. see <link>
would a cancerous (lymphoma breast cancer etc. ) axillary lymph node shrink?
a lymph node replaced with malignant cells growing as a primary lymphod tumor or metastatic from another site which has spread to axilla will not shrink without treatment either chemo or rt. the node will enlarge further or if unchanged will spread to adjacent nodes. it does not have the potential to metastasize further to non lymphatic tissue such as liver or lung.
would a cancerous (lymphoma breast cancer etc. ) axillary lymph node shrink?
system were to respond to a cancer versus continue to let it grow (as is necessary to get to a size detectable by any current means beyond accidental discovery under a microscopic or by one of the current tests which can partially detect a few cancers before very advanced e. g. psa. in practice) because this is huge change in behavior extremely rare. thus if node shrank likely not a cancer.
would a cancerous (lymphoma breast cancer etc. ) axillary lymph node shrink?
a robust immune system / immune modulating medicine can do it.
who is eligible for breast implants?
most people could have breast augmentation most importantly a patient needs to understand the risks and benefits. both the patient and the doctor need to agree that it is a reasonable treatment for them. contraindications include and active infection untreated breast cancer and any health issues that make surgery too risky. a patient must be both physically and mentally mature enough also.
who is eligible for breast implants?
there are several general reasons for breast implants- either for cosmetic augmentation or enlargement of the breast or for a reconstructive reason such as following breast cancer surgery. depending on the situation insurance may or may not cover breast implants.
what can cause swelling below the areola (besides inflammatory breast cancer)? no redness pain etc. swollen nodes but have been battling an infection.
swelling below the areoal is ususally from benign causes. inflammatory breast carcinoma is a lesion of the subcutaneous lymphatics of breast infiltrated with ca. the breast becomes swollen and erytenatous with the edges of the lesion elevated. a 3d mammo or mri of breast can resolve the issue. bx is necessary to ro inflammatory ca which can be lethal.
what can cause swelling below the areola (besides inflammatory breast cancer)? no redness pain etc. swollen nodes but have been battling an infection.
an abscess in subalveolar region needs to be ruled out first especially with a history of infection and swollen nodes. pl see attached link on the subject.

it could be things besides cancer of course - a fibro-adenoma for example - but what you describe needs a professional exam very soon. good wishes.
why do doctors ask for both mammogram and ultra sound for the breast?
a few studies have shown that mammography coupled with ultrasound can increase the chance of finding smaller breast cancers; however other studies have shown that it does not help with specific diagnoses and can lead to false positive results. the jury is out a bit on this one but some centers prefer to have both lines of diagnostic imaging to increase chance of catching a cancer.
what causes recurring hemorrhagic/proteinaceous breast cysts and do they increase the risk of breast cancer? my mom and material aunt have breast ca
at 49 y. o. cyst are not uncommon but most are clear with serous fluid just enough to keep ducts open. hemorrhagic cysts not that common and one must ascertain they are not developing into cytst lesions. cytology of bloody fluid might be valuable along with mri of breast if mammo neg. braca should also be tested to see if genetic changes familial.
when is a good time to get screened for breast cancer? my grandmother has/had it and she had to get a double hysterectomy.
breast self awareness/self examination is advised to all females once they get 20 years old. once every 3 years a clinical breast examination(done by a doctor) is advised. once you get to 40 years of age an annual mammogram(x-ray of the breasts) is recommended. if you find any lump or change in your breast structure or shape seek medical examination.
what is the likelihood that a woman will get breast cancer?
the likelihood of breast cancer in women is 1 in 7. this ratio will increase with strong family history of breast cancer of first degree as well as second degree. breast feeding mothers usually decreases the risk.
what is the likelihood that a woman will get breast cancer?
unless in the hereditary group the average woman in the us has a one in seven chance of developing breast cancer as an acquired disease. most are due to mmtv a virus passed doen from the black plague that enters the wnt 1 gene of the breast duct. in australia during the mouse plagues every 10 years the incieence increases to one in three women. this is reduced with 3d mammo.
why can't someone prevent breast cancer? is it genetic?
at least 90% of breast canceers are acquired via virus or carcinogen. the mmtv virus infects the wnt-1 gene to initiate ductal mucosal transformation. where mus domesticus is absent almost no breast cancer. there is a suggestion that endogenous sequences of the ltr of the virus can be passed thru endogenous sequences and reappear in later generations.
what is stage 3 breast cancer?
when the tumor in the breast is quite advanced often more than 5 cm(>2 inches) in size and starting to cause local skin invasion and also spreading into multiple lymph nodes in the arm pit.
will insurance cover breast implants?

swelling of lymph nodes under the arm is a symptom of breast cancer? are the swollen lymph nodes supposed to be pain-free?
lymphatic system absorbs/carries things too big to go into the arteries/veins like bacteria eaten by white cells and digested food. lymph nodes "taste" the lymph for anything bad like bacteria/viruses/cancers etc. when it detects a problem it alerts the immune system and your body reacts. they enlarge in response to the inflammation they create when they react. they shrink when all is well.
swelling of lymph nodes under the arm is a symptom of breast cancer? are the swollen lymph nodes supposed to be pain-free?
usually a breast mass would be felt by the time breast cancer has spread to enlarged lymph nodes that can be felt under the arm. usually the lymph nodes are painless. any physical change you are feeling should be evaluated with a doctor and likely a mammogram. many things including infections and cancers can cause enlarged lymph nodes.
suspicious clusters of pleomorphic calcifications found on one breast only during mammogram?
suspicious cluster opleomorphic microcalcifications on mgram may be due to breast cancer. therefore you need to undergo a biopsy. usually they sggest a stereotactic biopsy which is a type od percutaneous needle biopsy n a special x-ray table. please follow with a breast carer specialist or a radiologist experien in this procedure.

breast cancer can be stage 0 non-invasive. stage1 stage 2 stage 3 and stage 4. each of the stages has a variety if statistical possible outcomes and results. also depends on cell type hormone receptors dna of the tumor response to treatments and radiation underlying health factors etc. too complicated to discuss here. the oncologist can be more specific for the patient's specific situation.
stage of breast cancer as a relation to prognosis?
survival depends on many factors such as overall health age stage of disease and response to treatment. additional information may be found at www. cancer. org.
stage 3 breast cancer?
stage 3 breast cancer indicates spread to more than 3 lymph nodes for a breast cancer of any size. will likely need surgery chemotherapy & radiation therapy. see an oncologist for more details.
stage 3 breast cancer?
stage 3 breast cancer means any size tumor with more than 4 lymph nodes involved or a tumor involving the skin or chest wall even if there are no lymph nodes involved. it's still a curable breast cancer but because there are usually multiple lymph nodes involved there is a higher chance it will come back. chemotherapy and radiation are always necessary as part of treatment for stage 3.
stage 3 breast cancer?
stage 3 cancer means the breast cancer has extended to beyond the immediate region of the tumor and may have invaded nearby lymph nodes and muscles but has not spread to distant organs. although this stage is considered to be advanced there are a growing number of effective treatment options.

stg 4 liver mets breast cancer. on 4/15 got- 650 gpt 350 bilirbn 18. now got- 390 gpt 190 bilirbn 24. on herceptin carboplatin linezolid cipro (ciprofloxacin). why bilirbn increasing while gpt/ got improving?
i'm being very honest here. in my experience this is a sign of tumor growth causing obstruction of your bile ducts. your bilirubin is too high for you to safely get most types of chemo. the tumor may be obstructing the main bile duct and sometimes that can be stented. but this is a time to ask your doc for an honest prognosis. warm thoughts to you.
stg 4 liver mets breast cancer. on 4/15 got- 650 gpt 350 bilirbn 18. now got- 390 gpt 190 bilirbn 24. on herceptin carboplatin linezolid cipro (ciprofloxacin). why bilirbn increasing while gpt/ got improving?
now usually called ast/alt are related to liver cell injury. bilirubin elevation however reflects cholestatic processes so it can go up when the others go down. alkaline phosphatase also probably very high?

should i get the brac 1-2 test? i'm 55. my mom was 48 when she first was diagnosed with breast cancer that was 32 years ago.
you should speak with a genetic counselor to assess your risk.
should i get the brac 1-2 test? i'm 55. my mom was 48 when she first was diagnosed with breast cancer that was 32 years ago.
if your mother is still alive (i realize she would be 80) she would be a candidate for testing if there is more family history of cancer if the family history is unknown or if she was triple negative (which you could not have been known 32 years ago). if she is no longer with you i'd advise you gather all the family history you can (positive or not) and visit a specialist in inherited cancer.
should i be worried about cancer if i find lumps in my armpit and possibly lumps in my breast?
if you have lumps in the breast or in the armpit you should get your doctor to examine you. it may or may be something needing medical attention. leaving it alone is not a wise idea. the solution to the fear/ scare is to seek medical advice and get over the probelm which means act now. not sit around and worry. even if it is breast cancer it is a treatable problem with good results. good luck.

if there has not been a dexa done in the last 2 years it is not a bad idea.
step mom decided to stop chemo treatments forr breast cancer. what to expect?
on how advanced her cancer is and what she's been thru thus far. for example if she has only involvement in bones and she's taking an antiestrogen pill she could be with you for quite a while. if she's been thru mult chemo regimens and cancer is in her lungs liver brain and bone time would be quite short. if it's the latter i would strongly advise enrollment with a good hospice program.

if you're referring to an enlarged lymph node in your arm pit it can be caused by non-cancerous things. you should make an appointment to see your doctor to have it checked out though.
silicone breast implants can couse breast cancer?
there is no direct link but there are concerns with the potential for implants to interfere with the detection of cancer. particularly using mammograms. special views (eklund) must be obtained. alhtough there may be a delay in diagnosis there has not been shown to be any effect on survival. with mri surveillance is improved and may supplant mammography. as stated alcl may be increased but rare.
silicone breast implants can couse breast cancer?
silicone implants do not cause cancer.
silicone breast implants can couse breast cancer?
breast implants do not cause breast cancer. there is a very small association between breast implant with certain type of lymphoma ( anaplastic large cell lymphoma ) however.
silicone breast implants can couse breast cancer?
i am not aware of any studies that show that silicone (or saline) implants cause cancer.
silicone breast implants can couse breast cancer?
large studies show that groups of women matched for age with and without breast implants present with the same types and size of breast cancer. so breast cancer is not caused by breast implants and breast implants do not delay the diagnosis of breast cancer.
silicone breast implants can couse breast cancer?
there is no evidence that implants of any type whether saline or silicone cause breast cancer although a recent study suggested that implants might make it more difficult to find early cancers.
silicone breast implants can couse breast cancer?
folks were worried years ago about the oppenheimer effect. it does not apply to breast implants. in fact women with breast implants have a lower rate of breast cancer. please see a board certified plastic surgeon. you will get your questions answered.
silicone breast implants can couse breast cancer?
that breast implants cause cancer. there is even a study which shows slightly lower risks in implanted women.
silicone breast implants can couse breast cancer?
the studies of many thousands of women with silicone implants did not find that they cause cancer. there is a type of lymphoma which was found to be slightly more common in women with silicone implants but the chances of developing it are truly minuscule. the fda has classified silicone breast implant as safe devices.
stage 2b idc breast cancer triple positive. us shows 6mm thyroid nodule with calcifications next to carotid. should i insist on fine needle biopsy?

stage 2b idc breast cancer triple positive. us shows 6mm thyroid nodule with calcifications next to carotid. should i insist on fine needle biopsy?
is not related to the breast cancer. it is not a metastasis. the specific ultrasound characteristics are important in determining the management of the thyroid nodule but thyroid nodules are common and based on size serial follow up is the most likely scenario.
stage 2b her 2 breast cancer 40 yrs old-dx 4/13-neoadjuvant treatment. just recently diagnosis with several pulmonary emboli. what should i ask my doctor?
cancers can cause blood clots most often as a result of not walking after recent surgery with a blood clot forming in the legs which then breaks off and goes to the lungs. this is treated with blood thinning medications and if contraindicated a vena caval filter can be placed which catches the clots. why you developed this and how long and what type of treatment for this is advisable to ask.
stage 2b her 2 breast cancer 40 yrs old-dx 4/13-neoadjuvant treatment. just recently diagnosis with several pulmonary emboli. what should i ask my doctor?
cancer causes the blood to get thick and can cause clots that travel to the lungs. ask ur doc if she needs to b on blood thinners and for how long.
slightly enlarged mediastinal node on car scan. is this significant? i have stage 2b breast cancer her 2 positive and recent pulmonary emboli

it could be and needs to be followed.
slightly enlarged mediastinal node on car scan. is this significant? i have stage 2b breast cancer her 2 positive and recent pulmonary emboli
most likely it's not but you should get a follow up scan in 3 months but if you can get approval a pet scan may be helpful.
surgeon said occult breast cancer spread to 2lymp nodes under arm no sign cancer in breast. surgeon advises take out lymph glands live breast. should?
the surgeon is giving you the "best evidence" advice. without detecting any tumor in the breast it is safer less mutilating less painful less expensive and better psychologically to leave the breast in place. usually the tumor is so tiny that it cannot be found. often chemotherapy (to kill any cancer cells elsewhere in the body) and radiation to the breast is done. good luck!
surgeon said occult breast cancer spread to 2lymp nodes under arm no sign cancer in breast. surgeon advises take out lymph glands live breast. should?
it's highly likely there is a cancer somewhere in your breast tissue even though it can't be seen on imaging. if it were me i agree that having a breast mri first may help find the cancer. but if that's negative i would have a mastectomy. breast cancer is curable and removing the cancer is part of the cure. also the doctor should make sure the cancer in your lymph nodes is breast!
surgeon said occult breast cancer spread to 2lymp nodes under arm no sign cancer in breast. surgeon advises take out lymph glands live breast. should?
is it biopsied? pathological diagnosis? there are times when breast cancer is in the lymph nodes but the primary may never be identified. if biopsy is positive ( note that there are different kinds of breast cancer. ) u need to see a medical oncologist to see if any 'systemic' treatment is needed before surgery. agree with breast mri- it is absolutely necessary. may possibly need pet scan.
surgeon said occult breast cancer spread to 2lymp nodes under arm no sign cancer in breast. surgeon advises take out lymph glands live breast. should?
an mri of the breast is necessary to see if any cancer is there.
surgeon said occult breast cancer spread to 2lymp nodes under arm no sign cancer in breast. surgeon advise remove lymph glands leave breast. should i?
mri of the breast can pick up otherwise hidden cancers. if still no primary in the breast it can be left intact and radiated instead of mastectomy.

stage 2b idc breast cancer-neoadjuvant. had taxol/herceptin (trastuzumab) for 16wks. now a/c chemo. is it risky to be without herceptin (trastuzumab) until surgery in jan?
you are receiving ac now and i think (and i hope) it should take care you cancer well --to shrink it down further- so you can have surgery in january. it is not safe to combine adriamyicn and herceptin (trastuzumab) as it could give you significant problem with your heart. once you are done with surgery- you will need herceptin (trastuzumab) to be continued for 1 year.
stage 2b idc breast cancer-neoadjuvant. had taxol/herceptin (trastuzumab) for 16wks. now a/c chemo. is it risky to be without herceptin (trastuzumab) until surgery in jan?
if you started ac this month then your last ac will be sometime in the latter part of november that means your next cycle of something would have been the middle of december and then in the first part of january. therefore you would only be missing one cycle of a therapy before your surgery. there is no reason to suspect that you would relapse quickly. you will be fine with the wait.
stage 2b idc breast cancer-neoadjuvant. had taxol/herceptin (trastuzumab) for 16wks. now a/c chemo. is it risky to be without herceptin (trastuzumab) until surgery in jan?
discuss this with your oncologist. no one should comment on this without knowing your whole case history and follow up exams.
stage 2b idc breast cancer-neoadjuvant. had taxol/herceptin (trastuzumab) for 16wks. now a/c chemo. is it risky to be without herceptin (trastuzumab) until surgery in jan?
you received upfront herceptin (trastuzumab). now with ac better to hold herceptin (trastuzumab). you will get to resume it later and finish 1 full year.
symptoms of breast cancer?
this is how most women discover their breast cancer. however most such lumps turn out to be benign. if you do monthly breast self exam you will be able to tell if you have any new lumps. they are often painless and grow in size if left unattended for more then 1 or 2 months. the tumor can also spread outside of the breast if not treated. promptly.
should accuracy be questioned of us/mammo results when symptoms are present? ie: new asymmetry on mammo pain swelling "crawling" feeling inside?
sensation you describe do not mean there is a breast cancer. breast cancers rarely present with the sensations you are describing. mammography is one of the best tools available to find even very small pre-cancerous lesions.

your lymph node is bigger than normal but i need more history to know whether to be concerned. is it on the right or left? is it rubbery tender or rock hard? do you have any other lymph nodes that are swollen? have you had a chest x-ray in the last year? a supraclavicular node drains the lungs and the abdomen as well as part of the breast. do you have other symptoms?
too young for a mammogram? breast cancer runs in my family and i'm really concerned about my own health. i'm only 17 - is it too early to get a mammogram?
for a screening mammogram but not too young for a risk profile if you have a strong family history. has anyone in your family been tested for the brca gene? sometimes screening begins in the 20s for brca carriers or other very high risk individuals.
too young for a mammogram? breast cancer runs in my family and i'm really concerned about my own health. i'm only 17 - is it too early to get a mammogram?
17 is probably too young. if you are concerned about an area you may consider an ultrasound. generally i recommend that women with a family history start getting mammograms 5 to 10 years younger than the when the family member was diagnosed with breast cancer or age 40; whichever comes first.
too young for a mammogram? breast cancer runs in my family and i'm really concerned about my own health. i'm only 17 - is it too early to get a mammogram?
mammograms become less accurate in women below forty and typically an ultrasound is the first imaging technique used. but there may be times when a physician will order a mammogram on a younger person. the important thing is to maintain regular follow-up with your primary care so your risk can be accessed and appropriate screening can be initiated.
too young for a mammogram? breast cancer runs in my family and i'm really concerned about my own health. i'm only 17 - is it too early to get a mammogram?
yes it is too early for you to get a mammogram. at this age focus on self breast exams and familiarize yourself with the way your breasts feel so that you can notice if a lump develops in the future. mammograms in young females are often extremely difficult to interpret because the breast tissue is so dense it hides most lesions. screening for breast cancer using mammography starts at age 40. if you have a sister or mother who were diagnosed with breast cancer when they were younger than 50 years of age then screening with breast mri and genetic testing may be indicated.
there is breast cancer history in our family. will my 18 year old daughter's risks increase if she has breast reduction surgery?
breast reduction surgery should not impact your daughter's breast cancer risk although the scar tissue that forms may impair the subsequent interpretation of mammograms. overall i wouldn't let this impact her decision one way or another.
there is breast cancer history in our family. will my 18 year old daughter's risks increase if she has breast reduction surgery?

the side of my nipple is slightly dimpling was that mean i have a breast cancer?
dimpling of the skin and/or nipple inversion are both breast changes that can be associated with breast cancer therefore i recommend that you see your primary care doctor for a referral to a breast specialist. depending on your age and examination findings they may want to get a mammogram +/- ultrasound. of course there are many false alarms but it's better to prove that it's not a cancer.
the side of my nipple is slightly dimpling was that mean i have a breast cancer?
skin dimpling could be due to a benign tumor scar trauma or cancer. best to get medical evaluation.
tamoxifen is given to breast cancer patients to suppress estrogen or both estrogen & progesterone?
tamoxifen is given to individuals with specific breast cancers that are driven to grow by the presence of estrogen receptors. tamoxifen interferes with the activity of estrogen in the breast preventing cancer growth. the role of progesterone receptors is unclear though progesterone receptors in breast cancer are generally associated with estrogen receptors making tamoxifen an effective therapy.
tamoxifen is given to breast cancer patients to suppress estrogen or both estrogen & progesterone?
tamoxifen is an anti- estrogen in the breast but can act like estrogen in other organs notably the uterus. women on tamoxifen who have not had a hysterectomy need to have a gyne keep a close eye on uterine health.
tamoxifen is given to breast cancer patients to suppress estrogen or both estrogen & progesterone?
tamoxifen is a selective estrogen receptor modulator which competes with estrogen to block this receptor on cancer (and other) cells. it does not suppress production of either estrogen or progesterone. ironically it is effective against breast cancer cells that harbor either the estrogen or progesterone receptors (although tumors that are estrogen rec. (-) and progesterone rec. (+)are rare. ).
the likelihood of men developing breast cancer at some point inlifetime?
the life time risk for men is minuscule compared to the 13% risk for women.
the likelihood of men developing breast cancer at some point inlifetime?
male breast cancer accounts for 1%of all breast cancers. family history can play a significant role. if a man has an abnormal lump in his chest/nipple area he should see his physician. men can get mammograms and ultrasounds for further evaluation. the good news is that male breast cancer is as treatable as female breast cancer when found early.

this risk is very low unless you have a genetic order involving a mutation of the brca gene.
treatment for her2 breast cancer?
the local treatment option (breast conservation versus mastectomy) are the same. the diff comes with systemic therapy. her2+ cancers are more aggressive but this is counteracted by the biological (antibody) herceptin (trastuzumab). this is generally given with chemo. since this is the case it may often given before surgery (neoadj) to gain additional prognostic info and shrink the primary.

results of estrogen incudcing herbs in pubescent teen (g) if a teenage girl (12-17) in puberty takes herbs (fenu greek soy saw palmetto ect) to increase breast size are the chances of ovarian/breast cancer high for her? if she stops taking the herbs

results of estrogen incudcing herbs in pubescent teen (g) if a teenage girl (12-17) in puberty takes herbs (fenu greek soy saw palmetto ect) to increase breast size are the chances of ovarian/breast cancer high for her? if she stops taking the herbs
breast size is pre-determined by genetics. herbs such as the ones listed will not increase her breast size and stopping the herbs will have not affect either way. think about it if the herbs actually increased breast tissue there would be no need for breast implants and women across the world will be taking supplements and saving lots of money. to answer your question i do not believe any formal studies have been done to determine if the above herbs will increase the risk of breast or ovarian cancer. unfortunately since these herbs are not regulated by the fda (food and drug administration) there will likely not be any formal studies any time soon. the person in question should know that her breasts are still growing and she should be patient. also learning to love your body as it was intended to be is the key to happiness and self confidence.

right breast cancer no lymph node taken out. had mastectomy clear margins 1. 2 cm tumor mitotic rate 1 grade 1 total score 5. treatment recommend?
if mastectomy performed no rt needed. the chance of nodal involvement appearing later is a possibility. it seems when tumor spreads to lymph nodes the disease remains in the lymph node chain and will not metastasize to other organs such as lung liver or bone. when nodes are left to expand they extend to level 3 nodes then eventually impinge on axillary vein a reason for resection.

small black blister on right breast. skin was radiated in 2000 for breast cancer treatment. it feels as if there is a cavity below blister?
an ultrasound may be helpful
small black blister on right breast. skin was radiated in 2000 for breast cancer treatment. it feels as if there is a cavity below blister?
with your history and in view of the fact that there is some irregularity in the breast tissue i recommend that you be examined by a breast surgeon. he/she may end up referring you to a dermatologist for skin lesion diagnosis and treatment after their evaluation.
should a woman who has two relatives in the same family with breast cancer history be concerned? even if the relatives aren't of the same generation?
breast cancer is a common cancer so it is not uncommon for relatives of a family to have multiple breast cancers. cause for concern would be breast cancer at a young age (below early 40s) in multiple blood relatives and also the presence of ovarian cancer. genetic counselors are trained to review family histories and genetic testing based on those histories.
stage 2 invasive duct breast cancer that spread to lobule. doing mri on other side to see if there is cancer there. might be in lymph nodes does stage change if it is in lymph nodes and other breast too? what is usual treatment? thanks
you have asked a thoughtful and important question. that has to be answered by a qualified oncologist. it is complicated and depends on protocols and full knowledge of your situation. if you are not sure of an answer from one oncologist get a second opinion from another. i am not an oncologist and not qualified to give the answer you deserve.
stage 2 invasive duct breast cancer that spread to lobule. doing mri on other side to see if there is cancer there. might be in lymph nodes does stage change if it is in lymph nodes and other breast too? what is usual treatment? thanks
the stage will be affected by the presence in lymph nodes but if it is in the opposite breast it will be a second primary which will be staged independently. it's commonplace to have a primary on each side and still get a good outcome
small short axis mediastinal nodes show on ct i had nhl 5 yrs ago and i am so scared what does this mean. doc. said scan in 12mths. also 2 4mm lung nodules. breast cancer 15yrs ago. i am nuts. he wanted to wait 12 mths. i said noooooooooo?
small nodes in the mediastinum( < 1cm) are not necessarily abnormal so you can relax and wait to worry. if you had any chest symptoms like pain fever or cough then a repeat ct scan or pet scan may be justified. if there are sufficient odds of your lymphoma recurrence being a consideration repeat imaging studies should be done in 3 to 6 months. lung nodules of < 5-10 mm are probably benign.

it sounds like you have a complex medical history and a potentially complicated situation. the best advise i can give is to ask the doctor who ordered the x-ray to explain it to you and refer you to the appropriate caregiver. i wish you well.

findings on chest x-rays may be "suspicious" but rarely "diagnostic". important considerations include comparison to prior chest x-ray and your clinical history. i anticipate that you will need a ct of the chest for more definitive evaluation. while it is normal human nature to assume the worst try not to get too far ahead of yourself. good luck-i hope it's a false alarm.

there is a possibility and this should be properly evaluated if you have an oncologist go to him or her they may do a pet scan or direct biopsy.

lung nodules have multiple etiologies most dreaded one being lung cancer or metastatic cancer from another organ of body. there are multiple factors that are taken into account including but not limited to is size and number of lesions smooth or stellate lesion calcification location and other significant history e. g weight loss appetite/energy you need further evaluation with ct.
there's a white spot on my legs and arms and its itchy. im a breast cancer patient taking up herceptin (trastuzumab) is there a connection? what ointment could you
i suspect a superficial fungus but there's several other possibilities; if it has not responded to a topical antifungal such as tolnaftate after a few days a physician's office visit is in order.
there's a white spot on my legs and arms and its itchy. im a breast cancer patient taking up herceptin (trastuzumab) is there a connection? what ointment could you
it's possible you are having a reaction to the herceptin (trastuzumab). in this case because the rash is on your arms and legs it might be better to take an oral antihistamine medication instead of using a cream. call your oncologist's office and ask them for advice. you may need to take an antihistamine before every herceptin (trastuzumab) infusion to avoid this!
tell me the metastatic triple negative breast cancer survival rates?
survival rates depend on multiple factors; age response to treatment stage of disease your overall health. this is a conversation best had with your medical oncologist.
the oncologist keeps insisting on chemo but i would rather have surgery only for breast cancer i would like another opinion is it always necessary?
if you are not comfortable with your oncologist's opinion you should get a second one. unfortunately surgery is rarely sufficient to treat breast cancer. more than half of all breast cancer patients require chemotherapy and even more are given anti-estrogen therapy. the breast is but a battleground; the war is won or lost in the whole body. there is no better means for systemic rx than chemo.
the oncologist keeps insisting on chemo but i would rather have surgery only for breast cancer i would like another opinion is it always necessary?
my influence "risks". has your oncologist explained the benefit what you "risk" by not taking the recommended treatment? if i were you i'd seek two other opinions. on the other hand if the oncotype test and 3 doctors would *not* influence your decision don't waste your money and their time. but remember the adage about "one treating themselves has a fool for a patient. ".
the oncologist keeps insisting on chemo but i would rather have surgery only for breast cancer i would like another opinion is it always necessary?
your body is your own and you make your own decisions. the treatment approach depends on many factors including the extent and type of your tumor. you should get a second opinion especially if you are uncertain of your own approach to your illness. just as importantly you should have a second opinion of your pathology (diagnosis) as the pathologist's interpretation is essential.
the oncologist keeps insisting on chemo but i would rather have surgery only for breast cancer i would like another opinion is it always necessary?
no one not even the most zealous oncologist can force you to do anything you don't want to do. only a complete fool would refuse surgery or the equivalent for a breast cancer but the decision to include chemotherapy weighs the benefits (which should be spelled out for you) against the unpleasantness and difficulties. get two more opinions.
there is a family history of breast cancer. should i be worried?
in order to answer this question we need to know the age at diagnosis of the relative(s) and how this person is related to you. you can seek out a breast center or breast specialist who can do a risk assessment and follow you in a high risk program.
there is a family history of breast cancer. should i be worried?
yes usually if there is strong family history of breast cancer you are at a higher risk to develop it. you usually need to start your mammogram early if the concern is high you might want to have a test to check if you carry brca 1 or 2 genes that are breast cancer genes.
there is a family history of breast cancer. should i be worried?
have a yearly breast physical exam perform self exams have yearly mammogram after age 40. you could also see a genetic counselor for brca genetic testing but that only accounts for about 15% of breast cancer. no help to worry cannot change your relatives.
there is something in my left breast. its like a small lump but its not painful. is it possible that this is a tumor or a breast cancer? tnx
it would be exceedingly rare for an 18 year old to develop breast cancer. you should however speak about your concerns with your friendly primary care physician.
there is something in my left breast. its like a small lump but its not painful. is it possible that this is a tumor or a breast cancer? tnx
a small breast lump is most likely a benign finding. breast lumps occur more often around the menstrual cycle. if the lump persists for a some weeks then see a doctor for an examination to be sure it is ok.
there is something in my left breast. its like a small lump but its not painful. is it possible that this is a tumor or a breast cancer? tnx
see pcp to have breast exam & referral for mammogram or ultrasound or mri especially if there is a family history of breast cancer. may just be fibrocystic changes but best to be checked. also check your armpits for lumps. if not already doing it learn how to self-check breasts regularly.
the radiologist said that the breast cyst i have is nothing bad or to worry about that is just fluid or milk is still the same size don't hurt its ok?
as long as the radiologist believes the lesion is fluid filled there is a low likelihood of breast cancer. also if the lesion has remained stable after several ultrasounds it is even more encouraging. we usually only aspirate (remove the fluid) if the fluid filled lesion is palpable and/or causing discomfort or if the fluid filled lesion has evidence of debris or solid tissue inside.
there is extra tissue mass in my breast. so may be i am suffering from breast cancer?
you should alert your friendly primary care physician as to any new lesions of your breasts.
there is extra tissue mass in my breast. so may be i am suffering from breast cancer?
any mass(which means a lump) in the breast should be checked out for cancer although more than 80% of them are benign. if it is hard to the feel of the flat of your hand then i would definitly advise an examination by a doctor right away. if suspect then an x-ray(called mammogram) is advisable through your doctor.
there is extra tissue mass in my breast. so may be i am suffering from breast cancer?
masses can be benign or malignant. a physical and imaging (mammogram/ultrasound) is necessary.
theres a slight pain in my right breast less than two weeks before my period is this a posibility of breast cancer? help pls.
this sounds like a benign condition called fibrocystic changes of the breast. you should however let your friendly primary care physician know of your concerns.
theres a slight pain in my right breast less than two weeks before my period is this a posibility of breast cancer? help pls.
it is most likely cyclical breast pain associated with you cycle. . however if the pain is not cyclical or changes you should see your md. also monthly self breast exam yearlly physician breast exam and yearly mammography are the best chance you have to detect an early breast cancer.
theres a slight pain in my right breast less than two weeks before my period is this a posibility of breast cancer? help pls.
usually the presenting sign of breast cancer is a painless mass that is often detected on self examination. many times it is accompanied by enlarged lymph nodes and in advanced cases skin changes/discolorations hat have an orange peel or "pau de orange" appearance. breast pain with your period suggests fibrocystic changes which are benign. go see your doctor for a thorough exam to find out.
transmission of breast cancer to bone is it dangerous if stage 0?
stage 0 breast cancer is non-invasive and by definition does not spread to the bone or anywhere else.
transmission of breast cancer to bone is it dangerous if stage 0?
if there is metastasis to the bone it is not stage 0.
transmission of breast cancer to bone is it dangerous if stage 0?
this would be stage iv.
transmission of breast cancer to bone is it dangerous if stage 0?
stage 0 or cis(carcinoma in situ) will not metastasize by the definition as it is confined to the original structure it started in (duct or lobule). continue or start your monthly self breast exams and get your annual mammograms.
transmission of breast cancer to bone is it dangerous if stage 0?
dcis ductal carcinoma in situ and if the cancer cannot burst through the duct it cannot access the blood stream or set up colonies elsewhere. the risk of dcis is that it may progress to invasive cancer which is why dcis is treated. to prevent progression.
the mass has shrunk so do i still have to have a lumpectomy?
i would assume you are talking about a breast cancer that is being treated with chemotherapy and there is no metastatic disease. surgery is the way to go after chemotherapy even if the breast lump had completely disappeared became non-palpable.
these days what's the thought about the link between breast cancer and abortion?
all the studies so far indicated no correlation between abortion (induced or spontaneous) and breast cancer - or any other cancer.
tretment of acase of breast cancer. with pulmonary hypertention. t2n0m0 pr -ve er- ve her2/neu+3?
this is a stage 1 breast cancer which can be treated with long term survival but treatment may include targeted chemotherapy that does have some risk of affecting the heart so really depends on severity of pulmonary htn and ascertaining your ability to undergo treatment which may include surgery chemo and radiation.
treatment of localy advanced breast cancer. large ulcerative mass of left breast. metastatic work up are free?
it depends on the receptor status of the tumor. is it estrogen receptor positive. is it her 2 positive. ? chemotherapy may help to shrink it to make surgery more effective. usually a course of radiation would be necessary. if the ulcerating mass has an odor flagyl cream/ointment can help reduce the odor
treatment of localy advanced breast cancer. large ulcerative mass of left breast. metastatic work up are free?
if it is still localized consideration if chemotherapy first i shrink it brides using surgery and radiation may be needed. if it is more than a couple of cm then chemotherapy will be needed if it is felt that you could tolerate it. radiation will help cleanup microscopic cells after surgical removal.
treatment of localy advanced breast cancer. large ulcerative mass of left breast. metastatic work up are free?
surgery with wide margin and perhaps flap radiation depends on other factors.
the bone dr gave me strontium ranelate for my osteoporosis t-3. 5. is it true it increases risk for breast cancer recurrence?
there is not a single paper published using the words strontium renalate and cancer in its title: <link> ncbi. nlm. nih. gov/pubmed? term<negative_smiley>strontium%20ranelate%5btitle%5d)%20and%20cancer%5btitle%5d i think you can be reassured. there is a radioactive strontium that is sometime used for bone metastasis treatment and that or course would be more concerning.
the bone dr gave me strontium ranelate for my osteoporosis t-3. 5. is it true it increases risk for breast cancer recurrence?
strontium helps in the management of bone mets from breast cancer. it also increased sensitivity of breast cancer cells to radiation therapy so it might be good for advanced cancer. china showed higher strontium levels (as a toxic exposure) in women with breast cancer but they did not control for other chemicals and exposures. the most significant risk for breast cancer is having had it before.
treatment of acase of locally advanced bilatral breast cancer large fungtic mass likley it occupay all left breast area with pulmonary small nodule?
you should see an oncologist for an entire work up as well as recommendations regarding neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by surgery with or without reconstruction depending on the ability for surveillance of local recurrence.
treatment of acase of locally advanced bilatral breast cancer large fungtic mass likley it occupay all left breast area with pulmonary small nodule?
chemotherapy.
taking promethium does this promote breast cancer?
studies are inconclusive about progesterone causing or promoting breast cancer. theoretically it's still possible that it can. any prolonged hormone stimulation can cause cancer growth esp. if there's a strong family history. <link>
today my mother was diagnosed with breast cancer and her mother died from breast cancer. what are the chances of my sisters and i developing cancer?
only 10-15% of breast cas are hereditary; your family history certainly raises the possibility although it may still be coincidental. there is a simple blood test to identify the most common mutations (brca test). if your mom is brca (+) there is a 50% chance you could have inherited this as well. this is best sorted out w/a genetic counselor--your mom's cancer doctor can recommend one.
today my mother was diagnosed with breast cancer and her mother died from breast cancer. what are the chances of my sisters and i developing cancer?
you should get tested all the women in your family. . if you want to know more go here:.
there is a lump right underneath my nipple and when i touch it it hurts. im a male and i just noticed this two weeks ago should i be worried?
men can have breast tissue develop breast lumps and even breast cancer. most likely it is gynecomastia - male breast tissue - given your age. your doctor can evaluate this and direct you in the proper treatment.
tiny red dots on left breast. no itching no pain not raised bumps just tiny red dots. can this be breast cancer?
at your age with that description and assuming you do not have a very strong family history the chance of cancer is low. the thing is it is still possible and no doc at health tap can do an exam. do yourself a favor and have your family doc or gyn take a look at it. best to you and congratulations for being a "never smoker".
tiny red dots on left breast. no itching no pain not raised bumps just tiny red dots. can this be breast cancer?
are the dots on the breast proper or underneath in the folds? at your age breast cancer is extraordinarily uncommon and a macular rash is not a sign. the rash is dermatologic and could represent milia allergic dermatitis or one of many other skin conditions. try a small amount of otc hydrocortisone creme for a few days; if no relief and if it still concerns you seek a dermatologist.
the doctor said my granny has breast cancer without carry out a biopsy and asked for the breast to be cut off immediately should i allow it?
there is more to it with your granny's permission speak to her doctor and get the right information as all the facts you may not be aware of. no doctor will perform mastectomy with out biopsy may be a core needle already done in the doctor's office. if doctor is performing mastectomy with out biopsy it is not too late to take her to different doctor. good luck.
thinking of getting on birth control but read it might increase the risk of cancer. history of breast cancer in family what should i do what's safe?
the oral contraceptive pill greatly decreases your risk for ovarian cancer and it is not a risk factor for breast cancer (it may perhaps protect). there are non-cancer risks but your physician can help you weigh these depending on your other life factors. i trust you are not a smoker.
thinking of getting on birth control but read it might increase the risk of cancer. history of breast cancer in family what should i do what's safe?
pills out weight the risks you are thinking off. yes any hormonal manipulation on body including contraceptives possible to have slight increased risk speak to your doctor. go for regular great examinations.
there is a white spot on my breast by my areola. it's not a lump. it's just flat. does this mean i have breast cancer?
located in your breast areola does not mean you have cancer. dx is suspicious when you have discharge eczematoid lesions around areola ( pagets) lump with breast calcification during mammogram etc.
there is a white spot on my breast by my areola. it's not a lump. it's just flat. does this mean i have breast cancer?
but see your pcp and if concern then see breast surgeon. any other skin spots? see dermatology.
the top of my right breast hurts pain spreads to right armpit. my areola seems to be turning white too. i'm worried that it's breast cancer?
breast cancer is rare in a 19 year old woman. other possible causes are breast pain that comes and goes with the monthly cycle large breasts that pull on the ligaments of the breasts or even chest wall muscle pain. chest wall pain is often 1-sided burning and occurs from overuse of those muscles by skiing rowing cycling swimming or other activities that strain the pectoral muscles.
they found a 6cm mass in my breast what is the changes of it being breast cancer?
most benign breast masses are smaller. nothing's certain until biopsy. be brave. ask to have more than one pathologist look at the biopsy. best wishes.
they found a 6cm mass in my breast what is the changes of it being breast cancer?
it depends on the characteristics of the mass which should be determined by imaging and a physician. you absolutely need a core needle biopsy followed by excision. don't be afraid be proactive and get the answer.
there is something in my upper diaphragm i can touch it and its like round. i do have breast cancer?
at the age of 17 it would be extremely unlikely that you have cancer of the breast. please have this mass examined so you can be reassured
there is something in my upper diaphragm i can touch it and its like round. i do have breast cancer?
liver is located on the right upper side of the abdomen- just right beneath the diaphragm. the spleen is located on the left side. i am not sure where is the location of the thing that you touch. if you are worried- please go to see your doctor to get checked. you are too young to have breast cancer.
thanx in advance ur all a blessing what can be found in a punch biopsy doc thinks tumor in back is my breast cancer spreading?
a "punch biopsy" by definition means removing a very small (1/16-1/8") circle of skin and a tiny amount of fat underneath it. the reason for doing so is redness or a "rash" that spreads onto the chest neck back or lower abdomen and rarely can be the return of breast cancer confined to the skin. this biopsy does not go deeper and is done by numbing the skin. good luck to you!
thanx in advance ur all a blessing what can be found in a punch biopsy doc thinks tumor in back is my breast cancer spreading?
hopefully the "punch" biopsy will obtain enough cells to identify the source of the tumor on your back and i pray that it isn't a return of your breast cancer in a distant place. a pathology doctor will look at those cells under the microscope and give your md an answer. (and in turn you as well. )
total hysterectomy at 32 for bilateral dermoid cysts. on estradiol hrt. told its safe and no breast cancer risk with estrogen only? is this true?
your surgeon ie breast surgeon if you had one may not agree. i would say that at this point in your life the benefits outweigh the risks especially if you don't have a breast cancer history in your family. the problem with having surgical menopause at such a young age is genitourinary atrophy and bone loss. it also affects libido
total hysterectomy at 32 for bilateral dermoid cysts. on estradiol hrt. told its safe and no breast cancer risk with estrogen only? is this true?
estrogens in small physiologic doses in younger womem are safe and do not increase the risk of breast cancer. after 50 years of age(hrt) does carry a small risk of breast cancer but that happens mostly in women who were also taking progestational hormones to stop their menses. i think you are safe until 50. then you should get an annual screening mammogram done starting at age 40 years.
total hysterectomy at 32 for bilateral dermoid cysts. on estradiol hrt. told its safe and no breast cancer risk with estrogen only? is this true?
as mentioned only carcinogens and viruses can lead to breast cancer. the use of hormone does not induce breast cancer but can lead to progression of an existing lesion dcis in particular.

-is no question here. it is a statement only. no response can be given.
tender nipple on lhs only no discharge or obvious lumps. had period 2wks ago. i'm scared its cancer.
breast cancer is very unlikely in a 26 year old. for good health - have a diet rich in fresh vegetables fruits whole grains milk and milk products nuts beans legumes lentils and small amounts of lean meats. avoid saturated fats. drink enough water daily so that your urine is mostly colorless. exercise at least 150 minutes/week and increase the intensity of exercise gradually. do not use tobacco alcohol weed or street drugs in any form. practice safe sex. get hpv vaccine.
twin sister has breast cancer. says she has ductal and lobular cancer. surgery chemo radiation and hormone therapy after. prognosis for this type?
the prognosis of breast cancer is dependent on stage of her cancer at the time of diagnosis. most breast cancers are stage-1 or 2 and patients do very well living near normal lives. check in case she had stage-3 cancer. which does carry risk for recurrence in the future. i think she will do well over the next 5-10 years but needs to remain under surveillance as there is always some unpredictabi
the skin around my areola turned brown. i'm 18 and never been pregnant. i highly doubt i am pregnant since i'm on birth control. my grandma has breast cancer. should i be worried about it?
increases in estrogen levels can cause increased pigmentation in the arealae and genital area. estrogen levels do increase during the teen years so that is the probably answer. you might still check for pregnancy because birth control pills do not always prevent pregnancy (failure rate of 1-3%) but it is unlikely. breast cancer in an 18 year old woman is distinctly unlikely-- you need not worry.
twin sister just finished chemo for breast cancer. is being short of breath on exertion a side effect of tc chemo?
different chemo agents have different side effects and weakness is a common side effect. it would still be prudent to discuss it with her doctor. you may consult this site for general information about chemotherapy. <link>#1
ultrasound vs mammograms? what are the differences between an ultrasound and mammogram? i had an ultrasound done and the tech thought he found a lump but he said he needed to investigate it more so he wanted to schedule another ultrasound. shouldn't i
if you have a lump that can be felt it's likely the radiologist will want an ultrasound as well as mammogram. mammogram uses x-rays to see calcifications that might indicate a breast cancer while ultrasound uses sound waves to see different characteristics of breast tissue such as blood flow size and shape of a lump and whether it's solid or cystic. ultrasound is also used to guide biopsy.
under my nipple my breast is sore to the touch and i mean hard to wear bra or anything. i have had a hyst. in 2008 so i know it could it be a sign of cancer my aunt had breast cancer and my mom cervical cancer
hello. first off i want to let you know that i cannot tell you the reason for your nipple soreness. a common reason for nipple pain is skin abrasion from friction. this can be due to a bra that doesnâ€™t fit well or physical activity with a bra that is not adequately supportive or physical activity (like bouncing) without a bra. it doesn't really sound like this since you were specific that the pain is deep to the nipple if this were the cause it should clear up within a couple of days. other causes can be an abscess infection of the duct inflammation of the duct or possibly cancer. if you have redness heat swelling a lump bloody nipple discharge fever or chills or the skin is cracking then you should contact your doctor now. take care.
under my nipple my breast is sore to the touch and i mean hard to wear bra or anything. i have had a hyst. in 2008 so i know it could it be a sign of cancer my aunt had breast cancer and my mom cervical cancer
this doesn't sound like a sports medicine question. i would consult a general surgeon dermatologist or plastic surgeon.
upper pain in my upper back it feel like pin and needle and im a breast cancer survival.
it could be simple simple muscle or arthritic pain but some one like you have to make sure it is not due to metastasis to bone have to see your oncologist for tests like pet scan etc please see your doctor as soon as possible when tests are negative you will get relief from medications ( & mental relief also ).
upper pain in my upper back it feel like pin and needle and im a breast cancer survival.
breast cancer survivors should always alert their medical professional to symptoms of new bone pain as this can be sign of recurrence.
upper back pain one year. ct of chest in nov 12 ok. mri spine ok. could this be missed breast cancer? i had mammogram sept 12 ok. not present at rest
pain in the back with movement is usually linked to posture of the spine or ribs. cancer at your age is usually found within the breast and the testing you have undergone already is reassuring. continue to be medically examined for your concern of cancer but seek a musculoskeletal physician to help with your chest wall pain.
upper back pain one year. ct of chest in nov 12 ok. mri spine ok. could this be missed breast cancer? i had mammogram sept 12 ok. not present at rest
the examinations you received would have found spread of breast tumor to the spine. put your mind at ease about that.
us revealed complex cyst/ solid mass w/ very dense breast. biopsy next week. had 2 syncopes & joint/bone pain? symptoms related possibly to cancer?
cyst in breast are common. but even breast cancer is not a common cause of syncope.
us revealed complex cyst/ solid mass w/ very dense breast. biopsy next week. had 2 syncopes & joint/bone pain? symptoms related possibly to cancer?
syncope not typically related to breast cancer and you do not even have a diagnosis yet. see your doctor about your syncope and joint/bone pain to discover the cause.
up back pain for 16 months i do have large thickening of breast had for long time and mam ok and us ok. temp daily 99. 3 or less. ana+1640. would i b sick?
you should see your physician to examine your breast carefully. if there is any lump it should be examined with an ultrasound(mammograms can miss 10% of breast cancers) so any palpable lump/thickening requires a biopsy to make sure there is no cancer in your breast. your ana level is quite high. it needs to be rechecked; if it is high on rechecking then consult a rheumatologist to advise further.
ultrasound showed benign cysts on breast. will they go away? any idea why they didn't show up on mammogram only ultrasound?
cysts are normal components of breast tissue especially in pre-menopausal female. they tend to involute after menopause. i am not surprised that they only show on one modality. some breast cancers (for instance lobular cancer) don't show up on either test. not to worry about this. if you are worried about breast tissue and your insurance can pay or you can afford it - an mri may be helpful.
used face wash for approx10 years that had triclosan in it. nervous about breast ca bc of this. is ca likely? wld be same risk from toothpaste w tric?
the risk of breast cancer risk from triclosan seems to fall into the "conspiracy theory" part of medicine at this time. most likely you have nothing to worry about. radiation exposure on long plane flights is probably more of a risk. basically everything you do has risk. otoh triclosan may have no substantial beneficial effect. it wouldn't hurt to stay away from as many "additives" as possible.
utz shows nodule is most likely fibroadenoma 1cm x 0. 4cm. im 29 y/o do i need fna biopsy. my mom has breast cancer?
fibroadenoma is a benign well circumscribed tumor with two components epithelium and stroma. only very rarely is the epithelium found to be atypical enough to be called carcinoma in situ and much more rarely to have invasive cancer. another tumor called phyllodes tumor can resemble fibroadenoma closely and does have malignant variants. good pathology exam is useful here. fna or core bx ok.
veryleft breast painful small amount of clear discharge when squeezed doc feels a 5 cm lump he said fibo cystic changes getting mammo its cancer asure?
from clinical history unlikely breast cancer but mammogram and ultrasound will clarify situation.
virgin with thick white discharge both breasts happening for years at physical talked to doc mammogram scheduled. needed?
so according to american cancer society american college of radiology and others it is time to begin annual screening. if you have had bilateral white nipple discharge for years it is not from breast cancer and the mammogram will probably not help much with determining the etiology. lab tests to check hormone levels may be useful.
viral flu for 10 days. still have fever of 37. 8 and now face pain on right side. cough. tight throat. why am i still sick? breast cancer? sore lump.
sounds like a sinus infection. see md who will likely obtain xrays and prescribe antibiotics.
viral flu for 10 days. still have fever of 37. 8 and now face pain on right side. cough. tight throat. why am i still sick? breast cancer? sore lump.
we're having a serious flu season. do you have a cool mist humidifier? fill it with one bottle of hydrogen peroxide and two bottles of water. that will give you a 1% aerosolized mist of hydrogen peroxide. the peroxide kills the bugs on contact (virus or bacteria) as you breath in the mist and breaks down into water and oxygen. you should feel better in a day or two.
why does one of my breasts sag more than the other? could this be related to breast cancer? 33 year old female.
the left and right sides of our bodies are never perfectly symmetrical so the fact that the breasts are not mirror images of each other is not concerning. however if you're saying that one of your breasts looks different than it usually would look then you would really need an investigation including an exam and mammogram at least.
when i raise my arm i see a very minor dent on my breast which is only visible in a shade if put under direct light it's not visible at all. worried?
look you can never really be too careful with these things. skin changes like this can be seen with breast cancers yes although your youth would generally argue against that thought and most of the time testing reveals just benign stuff if anything. but we can't be too careful in this context. i'd get a mammogram and breast ultrasound to be sure.

when i press my right brest just below the nipple i feel some pain and the pain started yesterday. could it be breast cancer.
cancer for the most part when related to breast starts in the ductal system and progresses to invade breast tissue with the appearance of a mass but no pain. this is followed by skin dimpling and again no pain. the latter is mostly induced by dilated milk ducts secondary to fibrocystic mastopathy. have mammo to confirm.

wat are intraaxillary lymph nodes? what are the side effects of radiation for breast cancer. & how long its given for earlier stage of cancer
the nodes in the armpit are often involved in patients with breast cancer and are generally treated with radiation to kill tumor cells. radiation also damages other tissues needed for drainage of fluid from the arm. due to that damage some patients develop swelling of the arm on the involved side. you should discuss these issues with your doctor who knows your health status better.
what does it mean if the technician ask if there is a history of breast cancer after a mammogram?
just doing his / her job. it's helpful to ask -- not that this will affect the reading. one might also be asked whether you have had any procedures on the breast.
with differing mammogram guidelines i'm not sure when to begin mammogram screening. what does mayo clinic recommend?
when to begin mammogram screening and how often to repeat it is a personal decision based on your preferences. mayo clinic recommends women and their doctors discuss the benefits risks and limitations of mammograms and decide together what is best. balancing the benefits of screening with the limitations and risks is a key part of deciding when to begin mammograms and how often to repeat them. not all organizations agree on breast cancer screening guidelines but most emphasize working with your doctor to determine what's right for your particular situation. for instance the u. s. preventive services task force mammogram guidelines recommend women begin screening at age 50 and the american cancer society recommends women begin screening at age 45. but both of these organizations acknowledge that beginning screening at 40 may make sense for some women after considering the benefits and limitations of the test. mayo clinic doctors continue to review studies about mammogram guidelines to understand what the studies mean for women's health. changes to mammogram guidelines might or might not be necessary in the future as researchers continue studying this topic. mayo clinic supports screening beginning at age 40 because screening mammograms can detect breast abnormalities early in women in their 40s. findings from randomized trials of women in their 40s and 50s have demonstrated that screening mammograms decrease breast cancer deaths by 15 to 29 percent. but mammogram screening isn't perfect. another study concluded that despite more women being diagnosed with early breast cancer due to mammogram screening the number of women diagnosed with advanced breast cancer hasn't decreased. the study suggested that some women with early breast cancer were diagnosed with cancer that may never have affected their health. unfortunately doctors can't distinguish dangerous breast cancers from those that are non-life-threatening so annual mammograms remain the best option for detecting cancer early and reducing the risk of death from breast cancer. the main concern about mammograms for breast cancer screening is the chance of a false positive result. this means that an abnormality is detected but after additional testing it turns out to not be cancer. this is especially a concern in younger women in their 40s and 50s who may be more likely to have a false positive result. if an abnormality is detected on a mammogram a woman may be asked to have additional mammogram images taken and possibly additional imaging tests such as ultrasound. these tests may determine the abnormality shown on the original mammogram isn't cancer. in some cases it may be necessary for a woman to undergo a biopsy procedure to remove a sample of breast tissue for testing. for many women having a biopsy that confirms there isn't any cancer present is reassuring and doesn't increase anxiety. if you're concerned about when to start breast cancer screening and how often to repeat it work with your doctor to make an informed decision. together you can decide what's best for you based on your personal preferences your medical history and your individual breast cancer risk. talk with your doctor about: your personal risk of breast cancer the benefits risks and limitations of screening mammograms the role of breast self-exams for breast awareness in helping you become more familiar with your breasts which may help you identify abnormalities or changes.
what can cause pain under the arm? is this a sign of breast? grandmother recently died of breast cancer. how common is breast cancer in a 24 year old?

would my annual bloodwork show breast cancer?
currently the standard is physical examinations and mammograms annually. however several companies are developing a blood test for breast cancer. this has the potential to detect tumor-associated antibodies and serum proteins that correlate with cancer cells in the breast prior to being detectable on routine imaging. this may be especially helpful in women with dense breasts. stay tuned
would my annual bloodwork show breast cancer?
blood work is of no use in making a diagnosis of breast cancer. there are no reliable blood tests at present so we use mammography and biopsy if there is a lump present on physical examination or it shows up in the mammogram.

what is the difference between bug bites on my breast vs inflammatory breast cancer? i flicked out an ant out of bra so pretty sure it's bites. about 7
one are simple bug bites and they will go away in a few days. the other is a malignancy that required proper identification and treatment. inflammatory breast cancer is a serious condition
what is the difference between bug bites on my breast vs inflammatory breast cancer? i flicked out an ant out of bra so pretty sure it's bites. about 7
inflammatory breast cancer is characterized by a diffuse redness with an underlying firm mass in the breast. insect bites will be separated from each other rather than have one diffuse patch of redness and no mass will be associated with them. if you have continued concerns consult your physician.

which lesion can simulate fibroadenoma's mobility at palpating? which lesion can simulate fibroadenoma at ultrasounds? thanks
a fibroadenoma can look like a breast cancer which is also a solid lesion. palpation and ultrasound may not be able to differentiate them. it calls for collaboration between a breast surgeon and the radiologist in my opinion to determine whether a breast biopsy is indicated.
what's the different between average risk for breast cancer to moderate risk for breast cancer? what's it mean 1. 2-2. 00 risk (for dense breast)?
breast cancer is common in the white race (caucasions). . nearly 12%(1 in <positive_smiley>of the women over a lifetime are effected by this disease. this is the average risk. so if you doctor says you have 2. 0 times higher risk your odds go up from 1 in 8 women to 1 in 4. that means you have to be more cautious in your check ups compared to others. breast cancer is much less common among asians.
what is the odds for breast cancer for women in her 40s with dense breast and no other risk factors?
it's moot. breast density is not a factor. if you find a dominant mass get seen without delay and a cure is highly likely. with zero risk factors it's low but the real protection comes from alertness.
what is the odds for breast cancer for women in her 40s with dense breast and no other risk factors?
the odds are tough to understand when you say you are in your 40's. please make an appointment to see a gynecologist to determine if your numbers are ok or if you need more (or less) treatment.

what could 'additional testing needed' mean after a routine mammogram?
that usually means that the radiologist is not comfortable enough with the routine views obtained in the standard mammogram whatever that may mean. it does not guarantee cancer so don't worry about that right now. the radiologist would usually call you back for additional images - a more comprehensive mammogram - or maybe a breast ultrasound or mri (depending on family history of breast cancer)

if you have cancer on both sides of the family talk to your doctor about genetic testing.
your thoughts on "preventative mastectomy". do you think it is a valid treatment?
no for everyone. there are specific indications like family history and the breast cancer gene. i recommend finding a breast center in your area and discussing with a breast specialist. make sure you get the facts and a true calculation for your specific risk.
exercise 6 days/wk consistently x6 months eat good see a nutritionist tsh normal. no weight loss on tamoxifen can that cause it? or something else? sugg?
issues. weight loss=a function of food choices & quantity vs. metabolic function; eating :good" will tend to prevent body fat loss. carb foods promote fat storage lchf foods body fat loss. tsh of little relevance unless very high or very low. tamoxifen promoted for treatment of some breast cancers is not associated with either fat gain or loss. study nusi. org & my many answers on body fat loss.
painful lump in breast. how to figure out what this is?

pulonary neruopathy: could the cause be my silicone breast inplants from breast cancer but never had any cemo or radiation?
i sympathize with your condition but it is highly unlikely that your implants would cause a pulmonary neuropathy. the mastectomy does by nature of the surgery resect many nerves but while this may cause referred pain will not cause pulmonary problems.
pulonary neruopathy: could the cause be my silicone breast inplants from breast cancer but never had any cemo or radiation?
whatever your pulmonary issues they are not secondary to your reconstructive implants which by the way are outside the ribcage. chemo or radiation can cause pulmonary problems but since these are not an issue in your case you should see a pulmonologist and find out what is going on. rest assured there is no credible scientific evidence that your reconstructive implants have any ill effect!
pulonary neruopathy: could the cause be my silicone breast inplants from breast cancer but never had any cemo or radiation?
not sure the question ur asking. but the implants should not cause neuropathy.
my mom had breast cancer at 54 and so did her cousin -- should i not drink alcohol?
occasional alcohol use is not a risk factor for breast cancer.
my mom had breast cancer at 54 and so did her cousin -- should i not drink alcohol?
epidemiologic results involving breast cancer are highly variable with some studies showing alcoholism to be a risk factor others not. perhaps folic acid deficiency which affects many problem drinkers is the rason. nobody has evidence that moderate use of alcohol places one at risk for breast cancer. the key is keeping vigilant for early detection.
my dance costume is really tight where the chest is. if i wear the costume too long can i get breast cancer?
there is no increased risk of breast cancer.
mother had breast cancer at 54 and her cousin had it at 48. brca negative and breast cancer panel negative (breastnext). how likely is it i'll get it?
although genetic testing was negative you are still at elevated risk. other factors could help determine statistical risk but not as accurate in a 25 yo. i would recommend establishing a relationship w obgyn +/- a high risk breast program. a yearly breast exam is important. a baseline mammogram at 35 yr and yearly mammograms from age 40 yr would be appropriate.
mother had breast cancer at 54 and her cousin had it at 48. brca negative and breast cancer panel negative (breastnext). how likely is it i'll get it?
even with the good info you provide it is very hard to estimate your risk. first who tested? you your mother or her cousin? second have you or your relatives seen a genetic/risk assessment counselor? i would hope whoever tested did see one. there are models to estimate cancer risk but which one to use depends on many factors and it would be prudent to get a full pedigree.
my friend finished chemo for stage 4 breast cancer in feb. she has had loose bms and stomach aches since she started chemo. cea level 5. 1. thoughts?
the cea is a poor indicator of breast cancer status. however patients with one type of cancer can develop other cancers and the elevation and symptoms could reasonably lead one to have a colonoscopy performed. however remember that chemotherapy can also cause immediate and delayed side-effects. best to speak with you primary and the oncologist to determine the best work-up.
my friend finished chemo for stage 4 breast cancer in feb. she has had loose bms and stomach aches since she started chemo. cea level 5. 1. thoughts?
she seems to be experiencing some of the side effects often seen in patients on chemo mainly gi upset and diarrhea. the cea level has nothing to do with that. make sure her oncologist knows about these symptoms. if she truly finished all chemo it should improve but if she finished a cycle of chemo and is to get more the problem may persist or worsen.
my ca 15-3 test is 29. 04& normal in the lab where i did it is <25 & my cea is 3. 03 normal is <3. 8. is it breast cancer? i have lumps in rt breast
these blood test are not helpful at all for early breast cancer or to diagnose breast lumps. an exam by a physician and possibly a mammogram or ultrasound is the best way to evaluate lumps in the breast.
my ca 15-3 test is 29. 04& normal in the lab where i did it is <25 & my cea is 3. 03 normal is <3. 8. is it breast cancer? i have lumps in rt breast
tests like ca 15-3 and cea are not meant for diagnosis but used as prognostic markers. so get proper evaluation that's mammogram and ultrasound.
how much would her-2 targeted treatment for stage-1 breast cancer (already had mastectomy) cost in the us without insurance?
but the treatment uses herceptin (trastuzumab) and it is easily available all over the world. moreover you may not need them unless your tumor size was close to 2cm or larger. let us know the details of the size of the tumor and we can be more exact in our recommendations. good luck.

after taking evista (raloxifene) for 5 years for osteoperosis breast cancer developed. is femara the best choice now?
in a 29 year old no. this drug is also used for infertility. it should not be used in premenopausal women. tamoxifen should be the drug of choice. but obviously the tumor should be analyzed to see if chemotherapy is necessary or not. hope this helps.
after taking evista (raloxifene) for 5 years for osteoperosis breast cancer developed. is femara the best choice now?
stage and hormone receptor status of the cancer determine what kind of treatment is needed. if it is early stage and hormone sensitive and you are post-menopausal femara (letrozole) is one of the drugs that may be appropriate.
are chronic leukemia and breast cancer related?
patients with chronic leukemia are twice as likely as the general population to develop other malignancies including breast cancer. this likely has to do with chronic leukemia patients having a genetic predisposition compromised immune systems or just generally being older.
are chronic leukemia and breast cancer related?
a very interesting question. there may be a higher incidence of breast cancer in women with chronic lymphocytic leukemia but there is no association with chronic myelocytic leukemia. mouse mammary tumor virus can cause both breast cancer and lymphocytic leukemia in mice. whether this has anything to do with humans is under investigation.
my grand mother and my mother has breast cancer but both are well now. so how many chances are for me?
women with immediate family members who've had breast cancer have a higher risk than those who don't - that make sense. but your chances are still only about 15%. and like your relatives the vast majority of women who get breast cancer survive about 92%. so you should not smoke keep a good weight and eat a lower fat diet. do recommended surveillance. self exams etc. good luck.
my grand mother and my mother has breast cancer but both are well now. so how many chances are for me?
self examine regularly breast feed your children mammograms biopsies of suspicious lesions.
my grand mother and my mother has breast cancer but both are well now. so how many chances are for me?
you should speak with a genetic counselor. genetic testing may be appropriate for you.
my mother was just diagnosed with stage 4 breast cancer. would cryotherapy/surgery be good for her to try?
stage 4 breast cancer is defined by the spread of cancer to other organ(s). this requires treating the entire body typically with chemotherapy. breast surgery plays a (limited) role in treating stage 4 patients but never with cryotherapy. perhaps you could come with your mother the next time she sees her medical oncologist?
my mother was just diagnosed with stage 4 breast cancer. would cryotherapy/surgery be good for her to try?
stage 4 breast cancer is treated medically. you should discuss your concerns with your medical oncologist.
hello. my wife suffer some pain in her breasts and she took an ultrasound for it. a doctor said it is possible to be fibroadnoma can i send it to you?
your wife may not have any serious problem as the complain she has is usually caused by benign conditions. so there is no immediate rush to find a doctor. but she will benefit from seeing either a breast cancer specialist or an oncologist who can provide proper testing and supervision for her long term care.
hi i have metastasis breast cancer and i am on anastrazole. my question is if i take essiac tea would it be interfere my treatment with anastrazole?
essaic tea was studied at memorial sloan kettering back in 1959 and at the nih in the eighties both results were against scientific evidence that it works. but it accelerate the destruction of the hormanl treatment and the chemotherapeutic agents when used along so ladies will not benefit from the medicine given to them. my advise stick to the evidence based medicine and get away from folk medi.
are lumps behind the nipples a symptom of gynecomastia or just normal hormone fluctuations?
a mass behind the nipple/areola complexes should be evaluated. this could be gynecomastia or breast cancer.
are lumps behind the nipples a symptom of gynecomastia or just normal hormone fluctuations?
could be either. would have a surgeon incheck it especially if any history of breast cancer in your family.
my 87 year old aunt has been diagnosed with breast cancer. she's had it for over a year. however she doesn't want treatment are there home remedies for this?
i would not recommend home therapies. a lot depends on her health. if the tumor is advanced surgery may be needed to prevent chest involvement or skin ulceration. if the tumor is small and not aggressive it may be possible that an agent like tamoxifen (estrogen receptor blocker) may give some local control without surgery. consultation with a compassionate breast cancer specialist is in order.
my 87 year old aunt has been diagnosed with breast cancer. she's had it for over a year. however she doesn't want treatment are there home remedies for this?
usually surgical removal is the first step and is well tolerated even in the elderly. if she absolutely refuses surgery and the tumor is not too big i have treated several patients like her with tamoxifen alone and have had reasonable success. there are no home remedies. a lot depends on her overall health (is she ambulatory in a nursing home etc. ) and the size of the tumor.
my 87 year old aunt has been diagnosed with breast cancer. she's had it for over a year. however she doesn't want treatment are there home remedies for this?
there are no home treatments for cancer. surgical removal of the cancer (which can be a minor procedure) & hormone therapy can be a first start for treatment of breast cancer.

current thinking has identified different subtypes of breast cancer based on their cellular origin and genetic makeup - luminal (phenobarbital) a luminal (phenobarbital) b her2 overexpressing and basal-like/triple negative. this is beginning to allowed more targetted therapy. moving forward molecular analysis and microarray genomic analysis may allow even more specificity.
are there different types of breast cancer?
the type of breast cancer reflects the cells of origin within the breast and what these cancer cells look like under the microscope. different types include ductal lobular medullary tubular and mucinous. these types do behave differently so this information is important; however the stage of the cancer better predicts prognosis.
are there any naturopathic remedies for breast cancer?
i do agree with the previous doctors answers; but i would like a bit of input. while conventional proven treatment--should be given to a patient by an expert in the field of breast cancer after the traditional treatments are given many times the patient is left alone-no real post chemo-post rads-post surgery protocal is rx--. too bad! good nutrition exercise yoga emotional support etc. big help.

breast cancer treatments are based upon evidence-based medicine with rigorous data to support our recommendations. while i respect my patient's desires to seek out alternative therapies to supplement their care never compromise a proven therapy for an unproven one.
are there any naturopathic remedies for breast cancer?
be very careful when you are offered non-conventional treatment for this serious but very treatable condition. naturopaths will mention 'immune balance' and 'chelation' and other unproven notions. they will offer colonic clean outs and acupuncture. none of this addresses the cancer which will eat away at you while you waste time with the naturopath. see your oncologist immediately.

usually a breast cancer lump will grow but certainly breast cancer lumps can stay the same size for a very long time.
can a breast cancer lump change size?
dan - breast cancer can stay the same for a long period of time but eventually will grow or change its texture (become harder and non movable). any lump should be checked out even if you don't think it is cancer. the key to breast cancer is early detection which greatly improves survival so please if you have a lump go in for testing.
can pain in breasts mean i have breast cancer?
brian i am assuming you are male. breast pain and lump in a male is usually a non cancerous condition called gynecomastia. it is a hormonal side effect of many medications in adult males but is seen during normal hormonal changes during puberty. you should be examined and a mammogram and/or sonogram may be needed to confirm that it is gynecomastia.
how does breast feeding lower the risk of breast cancer?
we don't currently know "exactly" how. breast feeding for six months and longer seems to make a difference. one theory is that milk production keeps the cells busy so that they don't have the energy to mutate into cancer. another is that toxins are drained with milk production. another is that hormone levels with milk production are protective - estrogen progesterone prolactin oxytocin etc.
how common is it to get breast cancer when you are a teenager?
but very very rare.

early retrospective studies gave conflicting results regarding the potential link between abortions and breast cancer. over the past decade more accurate prospective studies have failed to show any link between breast cancer and women who had abortions either spontaneous or induced.
can there be the possibility of a man having breast cancer?
possible but rare. in the us there are about 2 100 new cases and 450 deaths per year. other countries have higher rates. men with brca mutations have a higher chance about 6-8% lifetime risk. if a man feels a lump in the breast he should get a medical evaluation.
had a mammogram and ultrasound of breast confirming benign lump. told its just a lymph node - just concerned as i know breast ca can spread here?
breast cancer does spread to lymph nodes. . typically into your armpit (axilla) but we frequently see normal lymph nodes in the breast tissue as well.
can "bust-boom" (breast enlargement pills sold in amazon that do work) cause breast cancer? the ingredients include herbs working as phytoestrogens.
who knows? but why would you want to try it if you are not sure. probably not a good idea.
can "bust-boom" (breast enlargement pills sold in amazon that do work) cause breast cancer? the ingredients include herbs working as phytoestrogens.
to my knowledge the only therapy that enlarges breasts is the brava which has to be used in conjunction with fat grafting. the use of unregulated herbs to enhance your breast has known be shown to work in any scientific way that i am aware of at this time.
can "bust-boom" (breast enlargement pills sold in amazon that do work) cause breast cancer? the ingredients include herbs working as phytoestrogens.
any over the counter supplement sold as an herbal remedy does not have to be regulated by fda as normal medications do. thus while some ingredients may be listed others may not. while we do know increased estrogen exposure over ones life may stimulate breast cancer risk as well as cause other possible symptoms like benign fibroid tumors i'd also b worried about what's not listed.
can "bust-boom" (breast enlargement pills sold in amazon that do work) cause breast cancer? the ingredients include herbs working as phytoestrogens.
anything with estrogen in it can increase your lifetime risk of developing breast cancer and higher levels can translate to higher rates. the levels of drung in over the counter "herbal" medications are often not controlled for or even measured. i would be wary.
can you please tell me what exactly is combined modality treatment for breast cancer?
usually includes chemo radiation and hormone treatment.
can you please tell me what exactly is combined modality treatment for breast cancer?
breast cancer treatment centers on 3 basic modes of attack: surgery-removal of the cancer from its site of origin is often the first rx; chemotherapy-medication that circulates throughout the body to kill any cancer cells that may have travelled outside the organ of origin; radiation therapy-focused rx to kill cancer cells in/near organ of origin that may not have been removed by surgery.
can you guys tell me how big is a breast cancer lump?
breast cancer can be diagnosed with a not palpable (not able to be felt) abnormality seen on mammogram to a large palpable (able to be felt by a patient or physician) to an obvious mass growing through the skin. this spectrum of presentation can make the diagnosis difficult. see your physician immediately if there are questions.
having bloddy aspirate from a breast cyst tested. can you tell me more about this and what the chances of cancer are from this? i'm 36.
benign processes which develop when a duct becomes obstructed. with rare exception breast cancers grow solid; therefore if a breast lump is fluid-filled no further evaluation is needed. cysts require no rx although when painful aspiration can resolve the cyst. if bloody fluid is found it is common to test this fluid for cancer cells on the very small chance the cyst is cancerous.

how rare is male breast cancer?
less than 1% of all cases of breast cancer diagnosed in the us annually are in men. the lifetime risk of a man developing breast cancer is about 1:1000. men can inherit the hereditary risk for breast cancer (brca mutations) but even then the lifetime risk of actually developing breast cancer is less than 20%.
chance of ivf leading to breast cancer?
it's a great question that will remain open until the 'magic bullet' appears; but no good quality evidence exists to clearly support an association. i tell my patients that if an increased risk does exist it's clearly very small and hard to prove.
chance of ivf leading to breast cancer?
every few years someone makes the claim of a statistical link between in vitro fertilization and new diagnosis of breast cancer. a decade ago the supposed increase was attributed to more intensive surveillance in these patients for early breast cancers. the new claim makes little sense biologically; please do keep up watching for breast cancer as you would ordinarily if you choose ivf.
can using estriol protect against future breast cancer in a peri or post menopausal woman?
chemistry is a foreign language too worse when used in drugs. this cmpd has an additional -oh group on the steroid rings so cleave it an you get estradiol - pure estrogen. contraindicated in people with er + tumors i. e makes tumors grow. it is proposed as an alternative to prempro (conjugated estrogens and medroxyprogesterone) for thos with severe hot flashes and not at high risk for breast cancer.
can you still get cancer even if you have a double mastectomy?
the goal of mastectomy is to remove as much breast tissue as possible however there is always a small amount left behind. therefore there is a small probability of breast cancer even after a double mastectomy. of course if the mastectomy was performed to treat a cancer the chance of recurrence elsewhere in the body is unaffected by choice of surgical treatment.

can an oopherectomy reduce breast cancer recurrence in premenopausal women?
oopherectomy has been proven to reduce recurrence in estrogen-receptor positive pre-menopausal women. prior to tamoxifen it was a commonly used treatment for metastatic disease and is now known to reduce recurrence in high-risk premenopausal hormone-receptor positive breast cancer even without the use of other endocrine therapies.
can an oopherectomy reduce breast cancer recurrence in premenopausal women?
but maybe yes in er + cases.
can an oopherectomy reduce breast cancer recurrence in premenopausal women?
but that's a pretty extreme step. basically any reduction in estrogen can reduce risk. pregnancy suppresses estrogen production which is why nulliparity (not having babies) raises the risk. nuns have higher brca risk! so while oophorectomy will reduce risk it is also possible to reduce risk with medications. raloxifene is drug which works very well with few side effects. see your doctor!
can an oopherectomy reduce breast cancer recurrence in premenopausal women?
removing the ovaries dramatically decreases your estrogen production. any estrogen responsive or estrogen receptor positive cancers will lose that stimulation and decrease the chance of developing that type of cancer. recurrence risk of estrogen receptor positive cancers will decline.
can lymphedema spread from my arms to other parts of my body?
upper extremity lymphedema most commonly occurs following the treatment of breast cancer which involves lymph node removal +/- radiation. the entire lymphatic system is interconnected and swelling can occur anywhere in the body regardless of which lymphatic region was affected. though not curable this does respond to physical therapy.

how does thermography for breast cancer work? it sounds sort of gimmicky.
thermography while it sounds promising to the lay population especially when one is searching for options to mammography has never been show in any valid scientific study to have any value in screening or detecting breast cancer. the fda issued a safety warning against it and the people that promote it for financial gain. <link>
how does thermography for breast cancer work? it sounds sort of gimmicky.
thermography uses the skin temperature as a way to map the breasts. the idea is that tumors have increased metabolic rate & blood flow thereby generating heat that can be detected on the skin. sometimes works. it should be used inconjunction with traditional mammo & ultrasound not in place of. the official web site states that also. i've seen normal thermogram with cancer.
how does thermography for breast cancer work? it sounds sort of gimmicky.
cancer tissues have higher metabolism; higher metabolism i. e. burning more nutrients leads to production of more heat than in normal tissues. thermography maps the heat production in different areas and areas with higher heat production could be due to inflammation or cancer.
how does thermography for breast cancer work? it sounds sort of gimmicky.
thermography of breast or digital infrared imaging dii is additional new ornament in early diagnosis of breast cancer in expert hands . digital infrared cameras record heat generated in tissues cancer are very active metabolically any small change in blood vessels are detected and recorded but is not a substitute ( fda ) for mammography sono and mri for diagnosis of breast cancer.
how many breast cancer stages are there?
the stage of breast cancer is based predominantly on the size of the cancer and lymph node (ln) involvement. stage 0 is pre-cancer (carcinoma-in-situ); stage 1 is small cancers +/- microscopic ln; stage 2 is larger cancers+/-overt ln involvement; stage 3 is cancer involving the skin or chest wall+/-many lns or those away from the armpit; stage 4 is cancer elsewhere in the body (metastatic disease).

have there been any real advances over the past few years in breast cancer research and cure?
few yrs? surgery: a new recommendation to stop routinely dissecting axillae for nodes this decreases the risk of lymphedema without effect on os or dfs or recurrence. med onc: targeted therapies such at herceptin (trastuzumab) tdm-1 microtubule inhibitors are all new as well as new combinations being tried. radiation: partial breast 5 day course is fairly new.
have there been any real advances over the past few years in breast cancer research and cure?
many women are treated for dcis as if they have breast cancer when this can regress without treatment in up to half of the women. when you lump this non cancer diagnosis into the treatment results they look much better. if you subtract these women from the data there isn't much improvement in the past 20 years - just more expensive meds. women need to manage hormones/diet to prevent breast cancer!
how fast does invasive ductal carcinoma develop metastasis?
could be years or never. you do not mention: size; stage nodes + or - age receptor status (er pr her-2-neu). breast cancer treatment can effect chance of relapse. i find the questions about speed odd. the true answer is we do not know in an individual what will happen and rely on group statistics to frame what we tell patients. i emphasize that individual may not behave like a group.
how does having a baby lower the risk of breast cancer in women?
early menopause late menarche and first full term pregnancy by age 18 lower the risk of breast cancer. this is apparently done because the number of menstrual cycles is lowered over a woman's life by these factors. this lowers a woman's exposure to endogenous hormones like estrogen.
how does having a baby lower the risk of breast cancer in women?
the placenta puts out progesterone which acts as an estrogen antagonist (off switch) in the body to prevent ovulation while you're pregnant. the cyclic ramp up in estrogen is also avoided. this period of lower estrogen exposure lowers overall cancer risk.

how is inflammatory breast cancer different from other types of breast cancer? why is it difficult to detect and diagnose?
ibc occurs suddenly with breast pain redness or swelling or a rash. mammograms are often negative because the tumor cells grow in a sheet and don't form a lump. it is very fast-growing and spreads quickly. immediate chemotherapy is needed. it looks like an infection so doctors often try antibiotics first delaying diagnosis. see a medical oncologist immediately if you have these symptoms.
how is inflammatory breast cancer different from other types of breast cancer? why is it difficult to detect and diagnose?
inflammatory breast cancer is a rare and very aggressive disease in which cancer cells block lymph vessels in the skin of the breast. this type of breast cancer is called “inflammatory” because the breast often looks swollen and red or “inflamed. ” inflammatory breast cancer accounts for 1 to 5 percent of all breast cancers diagnosed in the united states. it is often misdiagnosed as an infection.
how do i tell between breast cancer and cysts in the breast?
cysts tend get bigger and smaller and change with your menstrual cycle. multiple lumps are more likely to be cysts than cancer. but the only way to know for sure a lump is a cyst (and not a cancer) is to have it examined by a healthcare professional who might order a mammogram and/or ultrasound.
how do i tell between breast cancer and cysts in the breast?
visit your doctor for a thorough check up.
how do i tell between breast cancer and cysts in the breast?

current guidelines recommend the following patients get screening mri in addition to screening mammogram. 1. brca mutation 2. first-degree relative of a brca carrier 3. lifetime risk of breast cancer is 20-25% or greater 4. radiation to chest between age 10-30 5. li-fraumeni syndrome or a first-deg relative 6. cowden syndrome or a first-deg relative 7. bannayan-riley-ruvalcaba syndrome.
how do i know whether i should get a screening mri rather than a screening mammogram?
mri is a super-sensitive test for breast cancer but is 20x more expensive than a mammogram. therefore it should be reserved for women who are at a high risk for developing breast cancer. this is particularly true for young women or those with very dense breast tissue on mammography which limits the interpretation of mammograms.
how can breast cancer spread?
it spread through lymphatic organ ( lymph glands) through blood circulation and direct invasion to the adjacent organ such as skin chest wall etc.
how can breast cancer spread?
breast cancer spreads through your lymphatic system.
how can breast cancer spread?
most breast cancers begin in the milk-producing ducts and lobules. these cancer cells break out of these ducts and lobules and enter into the supporting tissue of the breast--that's why it's called invasive. lymphatics and blood vessels are found within this supportive tissue. if the cancer cell enters these vessels they can circulate throughout the body and take up residence in another organ.
how do i do a self-check for breast cancer?
the new way is called the "vertical stripe method. " you carefully feel your breast tissue in an up-and-down pattern so you don't miss any areas. you can learn to do this by watching this video: <link> (it's a little old-fashioned-looking but it's the correct method. ).
how fatal is stage 3 breast cancer?
the most recent statistics from the national cancer database quote the above numbers for stage 3 breast cancer which varies quite a bit between 3a v. 3b or 3c. keep in mind that this is based on people diagnosed as long as a decade ago so it may not reflect the most up-to-date treatments.
how fatal is stage 3 breast cancer?
this is a hard question. it depends on whether it's stage3a b or c and the time of survival. at 5 years after diagnosis 50-60% of women with stage 3 breast cancer are alive. other factors are age receptor status of the tumor number of lymph nodes involved and treatment. remember that survival is improving all the time!
how fatal is stage 3 breast cancer?
the eight-year survival rate for stage 3 breast cancer is approximately 40% and the five-year survival rate ranges from 40% to almost 70% which means that many women will live for several years after their diagnosis. in fact many women live for much longer and several effective stage 3 breast cancer treatment options are available.
how fast can breast cancer spread?
each cancer is unique. some cancer cells have the ability to metastasize very early in their development while other can be slower to metastasize.
how fast can breast cancer spread?
first and foremost not all breast cancers spread: many are confined to the breast without any ability to travel to other organs. for those that 'spread' the growth rates vary between months to decades before they become detectable. furthermore chemotherapy may eradicate these cells that have spread and they may never become evident.
how do you screen for breast cancer?

how do you screen for breast cancer?
for majority of population mammogram is the recommended screening test for breast cancer and recommended to be started at age of 40. in high risk group- i. e. life time risk more than 20-25 has brca genetic mutation- especially at young age with very dense breast - annual mammogram and mri of breast would be needed.
how is breast cancer inherited between family members?
the genetic mutations responsible for the hereditary type of breast cancer are called brca mutations. if either parent has this mutation there's a 50:50 chance that any of their children will inherit this mutation. even with this mutation the chance of breast cancer is not 100%; it's closer to 60%(in women). keep in mind that only 10-15% of all breast cancers in the us are the hereditary type.
how is breast cancer inherited between family members?
the brca mutations that cause hereditary breast and ovarian cancers are transmitted in an autosomal dominant pattern. this mean if one of your parents has the mutation you have a 50% chance of having it.

how early can you diagnose breast cancer?
through regular screening with clinical breast exams performed by a trained physician and through screening mammograms.
how early can you diagnose breast cancer?
how? regular mammograms. as many as a third of all breast cancers detected by mammography are stage 0 (dcis) with cure rates that approach 100%. furthermore cancers can often be detected on mammography years before they could ever be palpated.
how can i fight chemotherapy induced nausea during breast cancer treatment?
begin with basic nausea medicines such as compazine or phenergan (promethazine) if not improved then more expensive medications such as zofran or others. it also helps if patients avoid smells or foods that seem to trigger the symptom. sometimes even perfumes and non food smells may be an issue and you can avoid them if suspected. foods like crackers 7-up ginger ale or ginger root can help.

how old should a woman be to get a first mammogram?
for most women age 40. for women with a history of breast cancer in a mother sister or daughter possibly younger. this depends on the age the relatives developed breast cancer. ultrasound and mri are better tests in young women with dense breasts. for women with a suspicious lump a mammogram ultrasound and possibly breast mri should be done regardless of age.
how does dcis turn into stage 4 breast cancer?
while not all dcis will become invasive cancer many cases will and to date we can not differentiate between those that will and those that won't. those cases that become invasive can then spread to lymph nodes or other organs. the latter breast cancer that spreads to other organs is stage iv breast cancer.
how does dcis turn into stage 4 breast cancer?
dcis is a pre-malignant condition. meaning the cells have the potential to become cancer if left in the breast but at their current state they are not invasive. dcis can turn into stage 4 breast cancer if they progress to invasive cancer.
how does dcis turn into stage 4 breast cancer?
by definition dcis is cancer confined to the breast ducts without the ability to spread outside the breast. nevertheless rarely a women with a history of previously-treated dcis will develop metastasis. a possible explanation is that a small invasive cancer was present but missed at the initial diagnosis. more likely is that we just don't understand everything about dcis yet.

breast cancer can spread in 3 basic ways - it can grow larger and larger invading into the skin or muscle; it can invade into the blood vessels and then travel to other areas of the body (most commonly liver lungs bone and brain) and it can invade into the lymphatic vessels and travel to the lymph nodes under the arm and other areas of the body.
how does breast cancer spread?
most breast cancers begin in the breast ducts where milk is transported to the nipple. invasive cancers break out of the duct and spread to the adjacent supportive tissue within the breast where the lymphatics and blood vessels are found. these cancer cells may enter these vessels and travel anywhere in the body.

i went for blood tests today to check tumour markers as i have previous breast cancer history. i ould only get 2 tubes of blood but needed 4. i am also going for a bone scan. opinions?
in all likelihood this should not be an issue. tumor markers are generally not recommended for patients with a history of breast cancer primarily because the markers that we have are quite poor. they tend to be most helpful when tumors are advanced and when patients are undergoing chemotherapy. if the tumor markers go down this is often taken as a sign that the therapy may be working.
i went for blood tests today to check tumour markers as i have previous breast cancer history. i ould only get 2 tubes of blood but needed 4. i am also going for a bone scan. opinions?
the requirement for number of tube comes from both the type of tube needed for a particular test as well as the volume of blood needed. the volume part also depends on how concentrated your blood is--less liquid in your blood means you need more tubes. your doctor will be notified if some of the tests needed could not be done and then he or she can decide if you need to be drawn again.

breast reconstruction involves expanders/implants beneath the chest muscles allowing the tissues just under the skin surface (where the breast used to be) to be easily examined but tissue reconstruction (tram diep or latissimus flaps) bring new non-breast tissues into the former breast region and require careful examination or scans to detect recurrence. good follow-up is part of cancer care.
is breast cancer harder to detect after breast reconstruction surgery?
most recurrences occur close to the skin so are usually palpable (fairly easy to feel) regardless of whether the patient had reconstruction or the type of reconstruction used. with implant reconstruction the implants are placed under the chest muscle which pushes deep tissues closer to the skin and allows for easier exam. reconstruction has no impact on breast cancer follow-up imaging studies.

arimidex (anastrozole) belongs to a category of drugs called aromatase inhibitors. these are effective chemotherapeutic agents for people with either estrogen-sensitive or *progesterone-sensitive breast cancers. this is only effective after menopause; premenopausal women may use tamoxifen for a similar response rate.
is arimidex (anastrozole) when given as prevention of recurrence of breast cancer only used with estrogen receptive cancer?
this question is nicely answered by a free article from jco: <link> ascopubs. org/content/23/<negative_smiley>1636. full neither arimidex (anastrozole) nor tamoxifen seem to have much effect on receptor-negative breast cancer.
is it safe to get breast augmentation?
although breast implants do make mammography slightly more difficult large studies have shown no difference in the size of breast tumors at the time of detection the stage of breast cancer or the survival rate between women with breast implants and those without implants. large studies have also shown no increased incidence of health problems related to implants with very rare exceptions.
is it safe to get breast augmentation?
it definitely interferes withe self breast examination and therefore early detection of breast cancer by the patient maybe not with radio graphic detection as much.
is it safe to get breast augmentation?
if you have a high personal risk for breast cancer then breast augmentation depending especially on how you choose to augment might not be safe. breast augmentation can interfere with early breast cancer detection
i know there are lots of new recommendations but what is the right recommendation for when to get mammograms?
the u. s. department of health and human services american cancer society american medical association and the american college of radiology recommend screening mammography every year for women beginning at age 40. those with a family history of a 1st degree relative (like your mother or sister) having been diagnosed premenopausally with breast cancer start 10 years before the age of diagnosis.
is there a link between cigarette smoking and breast cancer?
smoking is linked to all kinds of cancers. bottom line is there is nothing good about smoking.
is there a link between cigarette smoking and breast cancer?
there have been multiple studies done over the past several decades and indeed there are indications that there my be a relationship. some studies say yes others no. overall the results of these studies suggest that smoking probably does not decrease the risk and indeed suggest that there may be an increased breast cancer risk with smoking of long duration smoking before a first pregnancy.
is nipple sparing mastectomy safe for brca 2?
many studies have been published demonstrating this option to be safe both for treatment of breast cancer and prevention in women with brca mutations. no surgery will take the risk of subsequent breast cancer down to zero--there is always some breast tissue left behind albeit microscopic. therefore it stands to reason that the more left behind the higher the risk; yet it remains quite low.
is just breast enlargement a sign of male breast cancer?
but it is also a sign of gynecomastia - a common source of benign breast enlargement. have it checked out.
is just breast enlargement a sign of male breast cancer?
breast cancer in males occurs at about 1/100th the frequency of the disease in women and the presentation is the same: a lump in the breast. because it is rare and because men do not receive mammograms or routinely self-examine their breasts it generally tends to be more advanced in men when discovered. breast enlargement is more often benign (called gynecomastia. ).
instead of a mammogram why can't i have a thermogram?
you have the right to make your own health care decisions but there is substantial long term data validating mammography as an effective screening tool for breast cancer. for thermography not so much.
i have breast cancer in my family. should i have surgery to remove my healthy breasts?
depends on many variables in particular who in the family developed breast cancer what age was it bilateral? any fam history of ovarian uterine or colon cancer. seek out a genetic counselor or a high risk breast specialist. after a detailed history they may recommend genetic testing surgery or medication - or if your risk is low enough maybe nothing. high risk women should get mri.
i have breast cancer in my family. should i have surgery to remove my healthy breasts?
most women overestimate their family risk of breast cancer--this is best determined by genetic counseling followed by brca testing (the gene responsible for many hereditary breast cancers). if brca+ prophylactic mastectomy (+/-reconstruction) is a very popular option yet it may be too drastic for others. these operations are never emergencies--gather all facts and research what's best for you.
i know that some women have arm swelling after breast cancer surgery. why?
the arm swelling you are describing occurs secondary to disruption of the lymphatic circulation draining the arm either via lymph node removal and/or radiation therapy. when we used to remove 10-20 lymph nodes the lifetime incidence was ~25%. nowadays with sentinel lymph node biopsy alone the risk is closer to 5%. hopefully in the future we won't have to remove any lymph nodes.
i know that some women have arm swelling after breast cancer surgery. why?
lymph is the fluid in tissues. after surgical procedure some people have a tendency to develop swelling because lymph nodes are removed - the collection system for lymph. emotionally deep skin is the layer we bury sadness - literally we are weeping inside. it is easier to bury emotions makes this bearable. read my book called meridian medicine available on itunes to learn more.
is there any routine breast cancer genetic testing?
it is not a routine test for everybody with breast cancer. however if you have significant risk with more than one family member having breast cancer or ovarian cancer at younger age especially or multiple other type of cancers in the family- a brca 1 and 2 analysis would be something that routinely be done to rule out breast-ovary hereditary syndrome.
is there any routine breast cancer genetic testing?
if you have strong family history of breast cancer (mother sister) and worry about genetic correlation then talk to your doctor about testing for brca 1 and brca 2 genes.
is breast cancer the same as a breast carcinoma?
99+ percent of breast cancers are classed as carcinoma. sarcomas tend to arise in connective tissue like muscle and bones and are rare in the breast as is lymphoma.
is breast cancer the same as a breast carcinoma?
breast cancer and carcinoma are terms used interchangeably.
is breast cancer the same as a breast carcinoma?
cancer is common lingo; carcinoma is high falutin medicalese.
is a breast symptom usually a sign for breast cancer?
most breast issues are not breast cancer. when all diagnoses are considered breast cancer is not that common. however if you give weight to those diagnoses you worry about breast cancer becomes more prominent. much depends on the breast symptom age genetic history time from last mammogram and physical exam. please ask your ob to examine this issue.
is a breast symptom usually a sign for breast cancer?
a symptom is what you the patient experience a sign is what the physician finds. some early breast cancers do not present with any symptoms (i. e. calcification on a mammogram). a common symptom is a painless mass. you should be aware of any change or abnormality in your breast by performing self exams every month. please contact your doctor is something feels different.
is there such a thing as a mucinous carcinoma breast cancer?
mucinous or colloid breast cancers are a rare type of breast cancer characterized by the production of mucus within the tumor. these tend to be low-grade tumors are usually estrogen-receptor positive and her-2/neu negative. treatment follows the same criteria for all breast cancers.
is there such a thing as a mucinous carcinoma breast cancer?
some carcinomas of the breast may make mucus and those though uncommon are referred to as mutinous adenocarcinomas.
is it safe to have breast reconstruction done at the same time as a mastectomy? my surgeon has said we can do the mastectomy and then immediately do the breast reconstruction. i like the idea but am worried about the extra time that would take. is it saf
immediate breast reconstruction is offered when it will not interfere with the treatment of your breast cancer. there are a few situations where delayed reconstruction is recommended not because the added surgery is unsafe but because the expander or implant may make detection of recurrence or treatment more difficult (uncommon). delay is most often recommended for larger more aggressive tumor.
is it safe to have breast reconstruction done at the same time as a mastectomy? my surgeon has said we can do the mastectomy and then immediately do the breast reconstruction. i like the idea but am worried about the extra time that would take. is it saf
a very good and safe option. advantages: keeping the natural breast skin ("skin sparing mastectomy") less scarring and the patient wakes up from the surgery "complete" avoiding the experience of a flat chest. sometimes "nipple-sparing mastectomy" can be performed which preserves the nipple and areola as well as the breast skin. most women with early breast cancer (stage i or 2) are candidates.
is bleeding from nipple breast cancer?
bloody nipple discharge is usually secondary to a benign tumor or chronic inflammation within the duct with breast cancer a distant third. any woman with bloody discharge requires breast evaluation which will include a diagnostic mammogram+/-ultrasound physical examination and nipple aspiration cytology. if the results remain equivocal a surgical biopsy (terminal duct excision) may be done.
is bleeding from nipple breast cancer?
bleeding from the nipple can be related to local trauma during aggressive sexual activity breast cancer and polyps in the breast ducts. if you have blood coming from the nipple it is important to see a surgeon and get it evaluated just in case it is related to cancer.
is bleeding from nipple breast cancer?
breast cancer can cause it. paget's disease of the breast can have nipple bleeding. this can point to breast cancer and the cells themselves are considered malignant. inverted nipple and fissure of the nipple can have bleeding. infection might cause it also.
i have a family history of breast cancer and would like to know when my mammograms should start?
it depends- how strong a family history if other family members have been tested positive for the brca 1 or 2 gene mutations help guide when screening mammograms should start or for considering genetic counseling.
i have a family history of breast cancer and would like to know when my mammograms should start?
the recommended age for start of mammography screening is 40 years. you should discuss your family history with your doctor to see if variation from the recommended practice is warranted.
i have a family history of breast cancer and would like to know when my mammograms should start?
starting mammograms at 50 has been shown to save lives. there has been debate to start at 40 but the fact that the disease does not show up much before 50 mammograms don't often detect cancer before 50 and that no clinical study has proven this to save lives if started at 40 has so far kept the age at 50. many still think 40 should be the starting point.
i had the change at 52. i have taken some form of estrogen since then (40 years). do i need mammogram?
you need and should have a mammogram once a year- especially because of the age and due to your hormonal replacement therapy that can give you some increased risk for development of breast cancer. dont wait anymore- go to see your gynecologist or pmd- have a proper breast exam and annual screening mammogram.
i had the change at 52. i have taken some form of estrogen since then (40 years). do i need mammogram?
in general you should have an annual mammogram and clinical breast exam performed. the presence of menopause and estrogen exposure potentially increase your risk of breast cancer. the older we get the more risk for breast cancer we have. estrogen exposure and breast cancer risk is debateable as a causal effect but most studies show a slight or modest correlation with breast cancer.
is tamoxifen anestrogen receptor agonist?
tamoxifen is a partial estrogen agonist antagonist. help reducing breast cancer risks which have a positive effect in increasing bone mineral density.
is tamoxifen anestrogen receptor agonist?
tamoxifen is a very weak estrogen receptor agonist. it is frequently used to help treat breast cancer by binding to the receptors that are normally binding estradiol (a very potent estrogen receptor agonist). if the tamoxifen gets to the receptor first then it blocks the estradiol.
is a lumpectomy for breast cancer done with a local or general anesthesia?
in my practice i use a heavy sedation (also known as mac) with local or general anesthesia. it depends on how extensive the mass and if i need to do a procedure on the lymph nodes. with proper pre operative physical exam the risk for anesthesia can be assessed and the appropriate method can be selected. it is important to be comfortable so the surgeon can complete the procedure safely.
is a lumpectomy for breast cancer done with a local or general anesthesia?
lumpectomy alone is fine under local with sedation added. pts usually fall asleep but don't need to be "put" to sleep with breathing tube & paralysis. when sentinel node bx is added we usually opt for general (intubated or laryngeal mask if anesth will do it) since it's longer and the axilla & behind the muscle is harder to access & numb. regional block is feasible but rarely offered by anesth.
is a lumpectomy for breast cancer done with a local or general anesthesia?
most often the surgeon will inject some local anesthesia and the anesthesiologist will give some sedation as well. sometimes general anesthesia is needed due to the specific health problems of the patient or the location of the tumor. a tumor deep within a breast requires more anesthesia than one that is close to the skin. talk to the anesthesiologist and surgeon about the options.
is a lumpectomy for breast cancer done with a local or general anesthesia?
i perform lumpectomies under local anesthesia supplemented by iv sedation ("twilight" anesthesia). when performing lumpectomies for breast cancer i usually will perform a sentinel lymph node biopsy at the same time. depending on the patient this is commonly performed under twilight or general anesthesia. regardless this is out-patient surgery with a very short recovery time.
is a lumpectomy for breast cancer done with a local or general anesthesia?
this is usually done under local anesthesia with iv sedation. if there is going to be a lymph node dissection as well then the anesthetic may be increased to a general.
i am 53 years old and have not had a mammogram in about 15 years. am i putting myself at great risk? i am 53 years old and have not had a mammogram in about 15 years. am i putting myself at great risk?
is there a reason you haven't gotten a mammo in 15 years? was the last one too painful? your risk is that if you happen to get breast cancer without mammography it may potentially be diagnosed at a more advanced and less curable stage. i would urge you to try again or if you are adamant about not getting a mammo talk to your doctor about possible screening ultrasounds.
i am 53 years old and have not had a mammogram in about 15 years. am i putting myself at great risk? i am 53 years old and have not had a mammogram in about 15 years. am i putting myself at great risk?
this depends on your family history. are you doing self breast-exams? do you have a gynecologist you see regularly who does exams? is there breast cancer in your family? in general we recommend getting mammograms yearly after age 50 so try to make an appt soon. hope this helps.
i am 53 years old and have not had a mammogram in about 15 years. am i putting myself at great risk? i am 53 years old and have not had a mammogram in about 15 years. am i putting myself at great risk?
you should definitely see a gyn doctor for a check up and get a mammogram. ideally you want to do this annually. most breast cancers are curable when detected early so yes i recommend getting screened. it's not a fun test to get i have heard but it can make a world of a difference.
is breast thermography better than mammograms?
no. it is not indicated for screening mammography. mammography is the best modality we have to diagnose breast cancer
is breast thermography better than mammograms?
mammogram wiil pick up a calcified tumor. thermogram shows change in fucntion andis actually much more sensitive that mammogram but not nearly as specific. thermography has shown changes due to breast cancer years before calcification is shown on mammogram. while mammogram is the gold standard and the xray amount is small it is the yearly screening over time that increases the risk due to radiati.
if one had a lumpectomy with clear margins no node involvment and is on anti-hormones is it absolutely necessary to have radiation?
it depends on both patients' and tumor's characteristics. for most early stage breast cancer studies have shown that lumpectomy plus radiation is equivalent to mastectomy in term of long term survival. however recent studies also showed that radiation can be safely omitted in elderly patients (70 or older) with hormonal receptor positive node negative small breast tumor.
if one had a lumpectomy with clear margins no node involvment and is on anti-hormones is it absolutely necessary to have radiation?
radiation decreases the likelihood of local recurrence in the affected breast. no patient is obligated to take any treatment but in the case of breast cancer radiation will increase your chances of survival without recurrence. women who have radiation are actually less likely to have local recurrence than are women who have simple mastectomy. a general surgery colleague may also want to answe.
is there a chance of getting cancer in the tissue of the breast reconstruction? i am considering getting breast reconstruction after having a mastectomy. i am nervous about whether i could get breast cancer again. is the tissue where incisions and cuts we
breast cancer will not develop in tissue that is used to perform breast reconstruction. bc develops in tissue left behind or near the site of tumor removal. if there is concern about the ability to check for cancer recurrence such as when a tumor is close to the chest wall then i suggest the case be reviewed by the tumor board so that a clear plan for surveillance is understood before a recon!
is there a chance of getting cancer in the tissue of the breast reconstruction? i am considering getting breast reconstruction after having a mastectomy. i am nervous about whether i could get breast cancer again. is the tissue where incisions and cuts we
breast cancer can come back after either lumpectomy or mastectomy. breast reconstruction does not increase the risk of cancer recurrence. the risk of recurrent breast cancer after mastectomy is the same whether you choose to undergo breast reconstruction or not. however recurrent breast cancer like any cancer grows into surrounding tissues which can include the reconstructed breast.
is there a chance of getting cancer in the tissue of the breast reconstruction? i am considering getting breast reconstruction after having a mastectomy. i am nervous about whether i could get breast cancer again. is the tissue where incisions and cuts we
it depends on why type of cancer it is but mostly that is not the case.
is there a chance of getting cancer in the tissue of the breast reconstruction? i am considering getting breast reconstruction after having a mastectomy. i am nervous about whether i could get breast cancer again. is the tissue where incisions and cuts we
there are multiple angles to this question that i will address. i think you are asking if reconstruciton will increase teh risk of getting cancer. and the answer is no. however there is a risk of cancer recurrence simply from the mastectomy. for this reason many plastic surgeons initially recommended waiting 5 years after mastectomy prior to beginning reconstruciton to ensure that you were free of disease. that is no longer the case. another consideration is that an implant may obscure or delay detection of a cancer recurrence and while this may be true it has not been shown to alter longevity.
i have a friend that has stage three breast cancer in both breast and it has spread to the liver. what is her survival rate?
stage 3 means armpit lymph node in involvement. spread to other organs means stage 4. treatment options vary. best option is for her to have a review by a good oncologist for possible treatment options.
i have a friend that has stage three breast cancer in both breast and it has spread to the liver. what is her survival rate?
i want you to think about my answer-because it is the best. metastatic breast cancer at this moment is not curable. but often can be "controllable" for sometimes long periods of time--years+. current treatments are improving. the quality of time has alot to do with mindset of the pt. enjoying every day trying alternative treatments-along with trad tx. being loved-support helps alot.
i have a friend that has stage three breast cancer in both breast and it has spread to the liver. what is her survival rate?
survival rates are most appropriately applied to large groups of patients; it's impossible to give such a number for one person especially without knowing her own unique situation. as a generalization we usually talk about "remission" rather than "cure" when cancer has spread to the liver (stage 4 by definition) since it is very difficult to completely eradicate cancer in that setting.
i have a friend that has stage three breast cancer in both breast and it has spread to the liver. what is her survival rate?
spreding to the liver is obviously a more aggressive disease. however the prognosis will vary based on: do the cancer cells express her2 & hormonal receptors; if the cancer was already in the liver on presentation or spread to it while on treatment; can the tumors be surgically excised etc. you need to have a detailed discussion with your cancer doctor.
i had a suspicious mammogram and abnormal cells with pap smear. i amscheduled for further mamo and another pap. the 2 togethter worrisome or coincident?
they are most likely coincidental. a suspicious mammogram and abnormal cells in pap are findings on these screening tests and they don't confirm the presence of cancer. but rarely certain types of breast cancer can metastasize to the uterine cervix. you definitely do need to follow up and find out what these findings really are.
i had a suspicious mammogram and abnormal cells with pap smear. i amscheduled for further mamo and another pap. the 2 togethter worrisome or coincident?
there is no known connection between cervical cancer caused by hpv and breast cancer.
i am refusing to have a mammogram and now my nurse practitioner is refusing to refill my estradoil because of my decision. i had a hysterectomy at 26 and have been taking estrogen since. if i don't take it i have severe night sweats hot flashes and feel
hormone use can put you at increased risk for breast cancer so it is important that you get a mammogram. i don't know your age or how long you've been taking the medicine. the recommendation is not to take hormones for more than 5 years. there are some non hormone options to help manage the hot flashes.
i am refusing to have a mammogram and now my nurse practitioner is refusing to refill my estradoil because of my decision. i had a hysterectomy at 26 and have been taking estrogen since. if i don't take it i have severe night sweats hot flashes and feel
hello. it is recommended that when taking estradiol that you undergo regular physical exams and mammograms. you should also self-examine your breasts for lumps on a monthly basis while using estradiol. long-term estradiol treatment may increase your risk of breast cancer ovarian cancer or uterine cancer. estradiol can also cause breast lumps discharge and persistent breast pain or tenderness. you had a hysterectomy at age 26 but have no idea how old you are now. this is especially of concern if there is a familial history of breast cancer. i know that you don't feel you need a mammogram now. however it is not clear exactly what the results were with your last mammogram. sometimes that radiologist that reads the mammogram may recommend that it be repeated within a certain time frame if there is an issue that is being tracked. the bottom line is that is your nurse practioner's license that is on the line when she treats you. most of us care about our patients and would feel very bad if there was a bad outcome because we were medically cutting corners. based on the information provided i can not pass judgment on your nurse practioner. i must say however that if she believes that this is medically the best course of action that i respect her for not dropping her standard of care.
is mastectomy a very common procedure?
it is still common for more advanced breast cancer. with any surgical procedure you want to seek out a surgeon who is skilled in the procedure you require. ask your surgeon directly about his/her experience and about your different treatment options for your problem.
is mastectomy a very common procedure?
breast cancer affects 1 in 8 women. mastectomy or lumpectomy are the two most common forms of treatment. it may be possible to have a breast reconstruction either at the time of the mastectomy or once chemo and radiation have been completed. be sure to discuss this option with your surgeon.
is mastectomy a very common procedure?
in the united states - 60-75% of patients receive a lumpectomy for breast cancer but 25-40% are treated with mastectomy. reasons are size of the tumor multiple breast tumors or patient preference (and more and more women opt to have both breasts removed - especially if reconstructed). although mastectomy may be needed - always consider a second opinion (surgical oncologist or breast specialist).
if i don't know my family medical history what is the best time to begin having mammograms?
there is currently a debate whether to begin mammography at 40 or 50. the controversy is that in order for a screening test to prove beneficial it has to decrease the mortality rate of those that have the test. while mammograms conclusively diagnose breast cancers earlier beginning at age 40 the mortality rates are less clear. when weighing the pro's and con's i am a strong proponent.
is stage 2 breast cancer treatable with radiation and chemo or will i need surgery?
breast cancer in stage 2 still needs a lumpectomy and nodal evaluation which is surgery. afterward chemo and radiation is often recommended.
is stage 2 breast cancer treatable with radiation and chemo or will i need surgery?
currently surgery is an essential and starting point for the treatment of early (stage 1 or 2) breast cancer. surgery removes bulk tumor and involved lymph nodes and also helps in accurate staging leading to the correct use of follow-up chemotherapy radiotherapy or hormone therapy. less surgery usually involving sentinel node surgery for the armpit nodes is currently practiced.
is stage 2 breast cancer treatable with radiation and chemo or will i need surgery?
in just about all stages of curablle breast cancer but the kind has changed. while you can avoid mastectomy most of the time some women opt for bilateral mastectomy to avoid screening (no evidence of improved mortality) lumpectomy is as good if not better than mastectomy with properly selected cases. arm pit surgery for nodes has been questioned but sentinel node is standard.
if my mammogram is normal and i feel a lump does that mean that it isn't cancer?
a screening mammogram is designed to find cancers that are not palpable; while effective it can miss 10-15% of breast cancers. if you have a palpable lump then you need a diagnostic mammogram & ultrasound which will focus in on this lump. even if these tests are normal i recommend that you see a breast surgeon for a formal exam just to be on the safe side.
is it normal to have a mastectomy and radiation therapy afterwards rather than the other way around?
a small subset of patients who opt for or require mastectomy for local treatment of their breast cancer will need radiation therapy; this is always done after surgery. furthermore if they require chemotherapy this too will be given before the radiation therapy.
is stage 3 breast cancer usually fixable with an operation?
stage 3 breast cancer is curable but in addition to an operation most women will need chemotherapy and radiation therapy for the best chance of cure. surgery removes the cancer from your breast/lymph nodes but chemotherapy & radiation kills cancer cells that have escaped into your body. these escaped cells can return as incurable stage 4 cancer so treating them is very important.
is stage 3 breast cancer usually fixable with an operation?
stage iii breast cancer requires a multimodality approach to therapy using chemotherapy surgery and sometimes radiation therapy.
i've read about women with breast cancer in one breast choosing to have both removed. why would you do that?
this is a decision based on risk. if after counseling the risk of a future breast cancer is increased due to family history personal history or genetic testing sometimes a prophylactic mastectomy is recommended. currently it is felt that this is an all too common practice amongst average risk patients.
i've read about women with breast cancer in one breast choosing to have both removed. why would you do that?
1. to avoid getting a second cancer in the healthy breast down the road 2. because she has a brca1/2 mutation which puts her at higher risk for a second breast cancer 3. to have breast reconstruction done on both breasts at the same time 4. to avoid the anxiety and nuisance of mammograms and biopsies in the future.
i've read about women with breast cancer in one breast choosing to have both removed. why would you do that?
for many it is a personal decision they may feel there body failed them and they don't "need them anymore". for those with a gene mutation that puts them at high risk of getting another breast cancer it can substantially reduce their risk. if someone needs a mastectomy on one side they may opt to have both removed for symmetry.
i know that some women have arm swelling and pain after breast cancer surgery. why does it happen?
most surgical procedures. in mastectomy a nerve that exits the side of the breast is usually injured or sacrificed and irritation of is causes pain or noxious tingling especially when the arms swing during walking. swelling is independent of that and can be caused by removal of lymph nodes and exacerbated by not putting the limb thru frequent adequate range of motion- usually out of fear of pain
i know that some women have arm swelling and pain after breast cancer surgery. why does it happen?
arm swelling after breast cancer surgery used to be an all-too-common occurrence secondary to the removal of many of the lymph nodes under the armpit. the incidence of lymphedema increases in response to radiation therapy that encompasses this area. modern techniques for lymph node evaluation (sentinel lymph node biopsy) remove far fewer lymph nodes dramatically reducing the risk of lymphedema.
i know that some women have arm swelling and pain after breast cancer surgery. why does it happen?
if a person has had surgery in the axilla to check for lymph nodes they can be at risk for lymphedema or arm swelling. this surgery disrupts the passage way for fluid to drain from the arm which then causes swelling. thankfully lymphedema from breast surgery is not a profound as it once was since less lymph nodes are removed.
i know that some women have arm swelling and pain after breast cancer surgery. why does it happen?
doing breast cancer surgery the lymph nodes are removed. this causes the lymphatic fluid to back up in the arm.
is it reasonable to have a mastectomy for early-stage breast cancer and not have chemo or radiation?
a mastectomy does not guarantee you won't need chemo or radiation. the tumor's "personality" determines that. after a mastectomy you might need chemo if the tumor is aggressive. chemo treats your whole body to kill cancer that may have traveled. you might need radiation if you have positive lymph nodes or if cancer was near the incision site. ask your oncologist. it's complicated!
is it reasonable to have a mastectomy for early-stage breast cancer and not have chemo or radiation?
it is reasonable but survival is equivalent with lumpectomy and radiation. a mastectomy would be recommended for inflammatory breast cancer multiple sites of breast cancer in same breast or for those with a brca mutation. if there are not these things present it often becomes a personable decision whether to have a lumpectomy or mastectomy.
is it reasonable to have a mastectomy for early-stage breast cancer and not have chemo or radiation?
it is very effective to have mastectomy but not any more effective. it's the choice of the patient which option they prefer and best suits them. however even in early stages many times chemotherapy or hormone therapy may still be recommended to improve the odds or survival.
is it reasonable to have a mastectomy for early-stage breast cancer and not have chemo or radiation?
the current practice is to treat all non-invasive (intraductal) cancers but there are methods to forecast who may not benefit and thus avoid radiotherapy. chemo/radio used for invasive cancers can be avoded for very small tumors with no signal of invasiveness or nodes. when in doubt seek more than one opinion in each modality.
i have heard that mri is now used for detecting breast cancer. when is it appropriate for women to have a breast mri instead of or in addition to a mammogram?
mris are more sensitive than mammograms for detecting breast cancer especially in young women or those with very dense breast tissue; however they are 20x the cost. therefore we reserve mris for women with >20% lifetime risk for breast cancer. they are also very useful for determining if an implant has ruptured and determining the extent of breast cancer if someone may need mastectomy.
i have heard that mri is now used for detecting breast cancer. when is it appropriate for women to have a breast mri instead of or in addition to a mammogram?
current guidelines recommend the following patients get screening mri in addition to screening mammogram. 1. brca mutation 2. first-degree relative of a brca carrier 3. lifetime risk of breast cancer is 20-25% or greater 4. radiation to chest between age 10-30 5. li-fraumeni syndrome or a first-deg relative 6. cowden syndrome or a first-deg relative 7. bannayan-riley-ruvalcaba syndrome.
i have heard that mri is now used for detecting breast cancer. when is it appropriate for women to have a breast mri instead of or in addition to a mammogram?
several years ago the american cancer society published a list of guidelines as to what patient's qualify as high risk sufficient to consider for screening breast mri's. these include patient's with known brca mutations patient's with prior mantle radiation for lymphoma patients with a calculated lifetime risk >20% etc mmgs should continue. for example microcalcifications show on mmg not mr.
i have heard that mri is now used for detecting breast cancer. when is it appropriate for women to have a breast mri instead of or in addition to a mammogram?
mri is used in addition to mammography. just like ultrasound can help to enhance interpretation of a mammogram mri can clarify questionable areas.
i have heard that mri is now used for detecting breast cancer. when is it appropriate for women to have a breast mri instead of or in addition to a mammogram?
associated with "false positives" in the range of 30% leading to more tests (increased cost) and in some cases ill-advised excess mastectomy. currently they are being over-used in my community.
if i got a painful breast lump at the age of 15 could this be breast cancer?
a breast mass at this young age is usually a fluid filled cyst or a noncancerous mass called a fibroadenoma. i recommend seeing a physician or gynecologist for a physical examination.
if i got a painful breast lump at the age of 15 could this be breast cancer?
most breast lumps in 15 year olds (men or women) are either part of development or the result of injury. but any lump that concerns you should always be checked out by your doctor.
if i got a painful breast lump at the age of 15 could this be breast cancer?
brest cancer in teens is very rare. this should be examined by a physician so you can know without a doubt that you are safe.
if i have fibrocystic breast changes could that increase my risk for getting breast cancer?
fibrocystic breasts are often a sign of estrogen dominance. you may have too much or potent kinds of estrogen. your ovaries produce estrogen but so do fat cells. inflammation from sugar/trans fats make fat cells produce more. foods that are not organic contain pesticides which act like estrogen. your liver may not be breaking estrogen down properly. constipation prevents the release of estrogen.

fibrycystic changes does not increase your chance of breast cancer.
if i'm only 25 do i need to worry about breast cancer?
if you have a strong family history of breast cancer you may be at increased risk. talk to your doctor regarding genetic counseling specifically for the brca gene. if however you don't have such a history self breast exams monthly until age 40 then self exams + mammograms yearly should detect an early very unusual mass for your age. after menopause risk of breast cancer is age related.
if i'm only 25 do i need to worry about breast cancer?
you should know your family history and your risks. it would be rare for a 25 year old to develop breast cancer. if you have concerns you should see your physician who can answer your questions and perform an exam.
if he has breasts can a man get a mammogram?
yes he can. in fact there are thousands of cases of male breast cancer a year in the us.

1% of all breast cancers occur in men. if a man has a lump or other symptom he can definitely have a mammogram.
if he has breasts can a man get a mammogram?
large breasts in males are associated usually with obesity and the conversion of testosterone to 17-b-estradiol by an enzyme in fat called cyclic aromatase. elevated estradiol levels are found in men with breast cancer 95% of the time. over 80% are estrogen receptor positive!
is there a difference between inflammatory breast cancer and invasive breast cancer?
inflammatory breast cancer is a form of invasive cancer. it is rare and very aggressive disease in which cancer cells block lymph vessels in the skin of the breast. this type of breast cancer is called “inflammatory” because the breast often looks swollen and red or “inflamed. ”.
is there a difference between inflammatory breast cancer and invasive breast cancer?
inflammatory breast cancer is an aggressive subtype of invasive breast cancer characterized by the spread of cancer cells into the lymphatics of the skin of the breast giving the breast the appearance of an infection. thankfully this cancer is often very sensitive to chemotherapy. treatment is directed at chemo first followed by mastectomy and then radiation therapy.
is dcis breast cancer be caused by stress?
the risk factors for dcis are the same as breast cancer; age family history estrogen exposure etc. there is no evidence that stress increases that risk.
is dcis breast cancer be caused by stress?
no.
is dcis breast cancer be caused by stress?
there is no clear evidence that stress levels increase the incidence of dcis.
is tamoxifen the same as aromatase inhibitor?
tamoxifen belongs to a class of drugs called selective estrogen receptor modulators (serms). it works by blocking the binding of estrogen to estrogen receptors thus disabling hormone-sensitive breast cancer cells. aromatase inhibitors block the conversion of androgens to estrogens effectively removing estrogen from the body (in postmenopausal women).
if i eat fries more than twice a week am i more prone to breast cancer?
while there is no clear link between french fries and the incidence of cancer there is clear evidence between obesity and increased cancer rates. maintaining a healthy body weight eating a healthy diet and performing recommended cancer screenings are your best choices.
if i eat fries more than twice a week am i more prone to breast cancer?
high fat diet is probably linked to a slight increased risk of breast cancer. decreasing fat intake to about 20% of daily calories is good for overall health.
is breast cancer inherited?
it is estimated that approximately 10-15% of all breast cancers in the us are of the hereditary type. these genes can be inherited from either your father or your mother. if a woman inherits this gene they have a 50-75% chance of developing breast cancer in their lifetime. these cancers tend to occur at any earlier age and may occur in both breasts.
is breast cancer inherited?
there is a genetic compnent of risk for breast cancer. it is possible that if particular family members ( mother sister grandmother. ) have had breast cancer that you are at higher risk for breast cancer. if you have a concern about this please discuss your risk and what you can do about it with your family doctor or surgeon.
is breast cancer inherited?
even with a family history of breast cancer the majority of breast cancers are known as "sporadic"; approximately 5-10% of inherited breast cancers are related to a mutation in the brca 1 or brca 2 genes.
is breast cancer inherited?
it can be although the vast majority of women with breast cancer do not have a family history.
is it uncomfortable to sleep on your stomach with saline implants after a mastectomy?
not after the healing phase approx. 3 months and with subpectoral - under the muscle- placement as i use for my breast cancer patients. cosmetic augmentation patients -- under the breast-- slightly less time. a stiff shoulder with the mastectomy patients is more of a problem. most of my surgery patients sleep in a lounge chair 30 degrees upright for 2 weeks.
is there a benefit to chemotherapy in hormone receptor positive node positive postmenopausal breast cancer?
there is increasing data based on the oncotype dx test in women with 1-3 positive notes that shows that some women will not get much benefit from chemo and some will get a great deal. it can be useful in cases where a woman is reluctant to take chemo. this is done on tissue that has been already removed. most oncologists believe that women who have multiple positive nodes should get chemotherapy.
is there a benefit to chemotherapy in hormone receptor positive node positive postmenopausal breast cancer?
there is a defined benefit of chemotherapy plus an aromatase inhibitor compared to an aromatase inhibitor alone but it is small. the decision to use chemotherapy in this setting is dependent on whether the tumor is her2/neu + the stage of the tumor and the age and health of the patient. all decisions regarding adjuvent therapy hinge around the risks vs. benefits which is patient-dependent.
if men play with their nipples will they get breast cancer?
men should be examining their breast eery month like women. breast cancer while rare in men does occur.

in fact a man who is used to the normal texture of his breast tissue may notice a lump earlier than one who is not.
if men play with their nipples will they get breast cancer?
there is no association between trauma to the nipple and breast cancer.
is breast cancer hereditary?
it is estimated that 10-15% of all breast cancer cases in the us occur due to hereditary factors. this risk may be identified by doing a simple blood test to check for brca mutations. we generally advise testing family members with known breast cancers first before checking unaffected family.
is breast cancer hereditary?
it can be although the vast majority of women with breast cancer do not have a family history.
is breast cancer hereditary?
majority of breast cancer is sporadic disease. only in about 15% could be hereditary in nature. some other risk factors will include- dietary habits red meat alcohol tobacco sedentary obesity hormones use previous radiation therapy to the chest wall etc.
is there a connection between hormonal birth control and breast cancer?
it would depend on the type of birth control. there may be an increased risk in those with unopposed estrogen. (no progesterone).
is there a connection between hormonal birth control and breast cancer?
women who use birth control pills (bcps) are at a slightly higher risk of developing breast cancer yet this risk seems to disappear if you stop the medication more than 10 years previously and have not developed cancer during that decade. in contrast bcps may lower the risk of developing ovarian cancer. like all medications there are risks v. benefits that should be discussed with your doctor.
is it possible for your breast to grow after breast removal? if you had a surgery where the breast tissue is removed is it still possible that more tissue would grow gradually?
yes it is possible for more breast tissue to grow. depending on the reason for the surgery in the first place it is possible that not all of the breast tissue was removed. obviously for significant breast cancers the goal is to remove all the breast tissue to decrease the chance of recurrence. if the surgery was done to reduce the breast tissue(reduction surgery) or for a male with breast tissue then it is possible for the tissue to slowly grow back depending on the cause of it in the first place. if there is a hormonal signal from the brain (prolactin estrogen/progesterone) sent it can lead to breast tissue growth and even milk production. it is a good idea to be seen by the surgeon that removed the tissue to determine if more intervention needs to happen since the tissue is growing back and if that is something dangerous or not.
i am 21 weeks pregnant and have tender breasts. today i noticed a small lump in my right breast-should i be worried?
any lump in the breast whether being pregnant or not is a matter of concern until it is confirmed that it is benign. i would suggest that you definitely have it checked. majority of lumps are benign (non cancerous) but breast cancer needs to be ruled out. don't wait until the end of your pregnancy to have it checked. do it now!
i just found a lump in my breast that is very tender. i’m pregnant so my breasts are changing. could it be breast cancer? should i be alarmed?
any new breast lump that you find (even in pregnancy) should be evaluated by your physician. even pregnant women can rarely develop breast cancer but this is more likely a benign condition like a clogged milk duct. your doctor will decide if any additional testing is needed.
i just found a lump in my breast that is very tender. i’m pregnant so my breasts are changing. could it be breast cancer? should i be alarmed?
the lump is probably due to hormone and glandular changes but any lump should be taken seriously. no need for alarm but ask your doctor to check it. he or she might feel a breast ultrasound would be useful.
i just found a lump in my breast that is very tender. i’m pregnant so my breasts are changing. could it be breast cancer? should i be alarmed?
pain is not a common symptom of breast cancer. however you should alert any changes in your breasts to your physician.

did you undergo genetic testing for the brca genes? you should have if you developed breast cancer at age 35 or younger. this would be very important information for your daughters. in addition they should begin screening 5 - 10 years before you were diagnosed or at age 40 whatever comes first.
i had breast cancer. how often should i have my daughters checked for breast cancer?
even as you follow the recommendations of the distinguished experts on this panel or your personal md make sure that the regular check ups are not done from a place of fear or expecting the worse but rather a space of joy peace of mind & optimism. so glad you're doing better!
i had breast cancer. how often should i have my daughters checked for breast cancer?
starting 10 years before the age at which you had breast cancer your daughters should get breast exams by health provider and annual mammograms too.
if mammograms slightly increase my risks of breast cancer why does everyone say to get them?
because early diagnosis saves lives. mammogram is a cost effective screening method that has helped decrease cancer mortality from breast cancer by about 37% since 1990s when mammogram became widespread used.
if mammograms slightly increase my risks of breast cancer why does everyone say to get them?
it is all about risk. the risk of undergoing the mammogram is far less than the risk of having breast cancer. you are at an even higher risk of death getting in your car and driving on the freeway.
if mammograms slightly increase my risks of breast cancer why does everyone say to get them?
there is very little data to support that mammography increases the risk of breast cancer and if they do that risk is very low compared to the improvement seen in outcome by detecting cancer early. several studies confirm the survival benefit if screening mammography. however you are only 24 and shouldn't be getting mammograms for many years.
is my family history relevant to my breast cancer diagnosis?
especially first degree relatives with breast cancer such as one mother or sisters (or father or brothers for that matter). if one of these family members were diagnosed under age 50 that's also and important fact. consider genetic counseling.
is my family history relevant to my breast cancer diagnosis?
if your mother daughter or sister had breast or ovarian cancer especially before age 50 or if any man in your family had breast cancer you may have a brca mutation. if your family has a history of colon or endometrial cancer you may have lynch syndrome. tell your oncologist your history to see if genetic counseling and testing is needed. this is important information for your family.

family history of a certain type of breast cancer is important in risk stratification. if their is a strong family history it is a good idea to get genetic counselling to determine risk for your children.
is my family history relevant to my breast cancer diagnosis?
women are more likely to have breast cancer if such already exists in the family. furthermore there are some genetic cancer syndromes brca1 and brca2 which make breast cancer an almost certainty.
is my family history relevant to my breast cancer diagnosis?
some tendencies toward breast cancer run in families although most women who get breast cancer have no known risk factors.
is my family history relevant to my breast cancer diagnosis?
a family history of breast cancer is relevant as there is a genetic pre-disposition when family members have also had breast cancer. this also should heighten the awareness of breast cancer in one's children as well.
if i am advised to have a mastectomy what are the risks and benefits of immediate breast reconstruction?
almost all women who require a mastectomy may be given the option of reconstruction. the major benefit of immediate reconstruction is avoiding an extra operation and the emotional effects of having no breast. furthermore as many as 1/3 of all women who plan on having a delayed reconstruction never bother. rarely we prefer to delay reconstruction for follow-up of an aggressive breast cancer.
is paget's disease fatal?
paget's disease of bone is a relatively benign and self-limited condition which can sometimes cause pain and in the worst case deformity or fragility. but paget's disease of the breast is often a manifestation of an underlying breast cancer which can certainly be fatal if untreated.

paget's disease of the breast is an early form of breast cancer. there are many online forums for breast cancer and i recommend you join them. there are also local groups that meet in person that is more personable and helpful. check with your navigator/ oncology team. for a specific paget's group check google to see what is available.
is evista (raloxifene) as effective as tamoxifen in reducing breast cancer?
the study of tamoxifen and raloxifene (star) trial compared the effectiveness of these two drugs in the prevention of breast cancer and found them to be equally effective with a 50% reduction in invasive breast cancer as compared to placebo. however only tamoxifen reduced the rate of carcinoma in situ (dcis lcis).
is evista (raloxifene) as effective as tamoxifen in reducing breast cancer?
evista (raloxifene) and tamoxifen were compared in the star trial. the results showed that evista (raloxifene) was just as effective as reducing the risk of invasive cancer as tamoxifen with fewer side effects. there was no difference in the risk of developing dcis ore ductal carcinoma in-situ.
is it possible to have paget's disease of the nipple?
paget's disease of the bone and paget's disease of the nipple are two very different problems. the bone condition involves abnormal growth. paget's of the breast describes a certain kind of breast cancer.

this is a particular form of nipple breast cancer paget's disease in bone is different entity.
is combined tamoxifen plus hormonal therapy better for breast cancer?
studies show that adding tamoxifen to an aromatase inhibitor (what i assume you mean by "hormonal therapy") was not better than either drug alone.
is combined tamoxifen plus hormonal therapy better for breast cancer?
for tumors that are estrogen positive tamoxifen is the hormonal treatment for women that are premenopausal. if you are post menopausal then aromatase inhibitors are the equivalent. we do not give additional hormones because the goal is to limit the amount of estrogen.
is tamoxifen a must for er/pr negative menstruating woman for breast cancer treatment?
this and similar medicines are anti estrogens that block the receptors. so if the patient has negative receptors there is little benefit from the medication. so it's not a must.
is tamoxifen a must for er/pr negative menstruating woman for breast cancer treatment?
actually it's er/pr positive women who are potential candidates for tamoxifen. this is advised for women whose cancer stage mandates chemotherapy sometimes combined with traditional iv chemotherapy. furthermore we often recommend tamoxifen to prevent the development of a second cancer is breast cancer survivors.
is it safe to take evista (raloxifene) after five years of tamoxifen and five years of aromasin?
aromasin which prevents the formation of estrogen is effective in reducing the risk of recurrence of breast cancer but after 5 years you are very likely to have sustained bone loss due to its effect. evista (raloxifene) will arrest bone loss and certainly is very unlikely to increase the risk of breast cancer but it has never been studied as an advujant preventative like tamoxifen and aromasin.
is it safe to take evista (raloxifene) after five years of tamoxifen and five years of aromasin?
there are no studies which address this question so there is no evidence-based answer to your question. however tamoxifen is limited by the fda to five years of use for several very good reasons: even if you have had a hysterectomy and thus there is no uterine cancer risk some breast cancers have been observed to mutate into resistant forms after 5 years on it. continued.
is mastitis found only in women?
most common post -partum but other times infection or inflammation can occur but always this has to be checked by a md for the rare possibility of inflammatory breast cancer males they luck out again -- rare- i have only 2 in 3! years with cysts and infection -one due to trauma-- one with 2nd dcis.

it is possible. although the majority of women with breast cancer have no family history of breast cancer.
if a breast lump is irregular instead of round is it more likely to be cancer?
in general cancers tend to grow in an irregular crab-like pattern (crab in latin is cancer). however many breast cancers can feel round and smooth. bottom line: any new lump in the breast should be evaluated by a physician regardless of the shape.
is a mammogram with breast implants effective?
the radiology technician will likely take an extra few views but the radiologist will be able to visualize your entire breast. extensive studies have shown that breast implants do not decrease the ability of a radiologist to detect breast cancers.
is a mammogram with breast implants effective?
mammograms can be performed with breast implants but visualization of the breast tissue may not be a complete as a woman without implants. this has not be shown to have any effect on overall survival in those women that unfortunately develop breast cancer.
is a fibroadenoma a type of breast cancer?
fibroadenomas are the most common benign tumors of the breast. they are often estrogen sensitive and are prone to grow in estrogen-rich environments. accordingly it is not uncomon for these to develop after puberty pregnancy or following the use of birth control pills or hormone replacement therapy. if a biopsy has been performed to establish the diagnosis they do not need to be removed.
is a fibroadenoma a type of breast cancer?
fibroadenomas are common benign lesions. along with cysts these are the most common causes of a breast mass particularly in younger women. they aren't cancer don't turn into cancer and aren't associated with a high risk of eventually developing breast cancer. surgical excision is an option and sometimes recommended if they are getting bigger. cryoablation is another option.
is a fibroadenoma a type of breast cancer?
no it is a benign tumor.
is a fibroadenoma a type of breast cancer?
a fibroadenoma is a benign growth - not a cancer. they are common and often remain stable in size. however you should see a physician if you detect any mass in your breast. demonstrate to the doctor exactly what you feel especially your doc does not discover it during your breast exam - do not just ignore it. discuss what it might be and plans for follow-up.

is breast cancer passed down in families even for men?
while most cases of breast cancer are not related to heredity those that are can be inherited from either parent. furthermore a man that harbors this genetic predisposition is at personal risk for breast cancer and can pass this risk to his children. if you have multiple family members with breast cancer there is a simple blood (brca test) test to determine if you have inherited that risk.
is breast cancer passed down in families even for men?
why the majority of breast cancer patients have no family history of breast cancer there are certain genes that can be passed down. men who inherit the brca-2 gene have a increased risk of breast cancer. the role of brca-1 in men is unclear.
is there any link between breast cancer and lung cancer?
breast cancer can spread to the lungs. very rarely lung cancer can spread to the breasts. some lung cancers are estrogen or progesterone receptor positive.

breast cancer can spread to the lungs but we still consider it breast cancer (we call it metastatic then). other than that i don't know of a link with breast cancer and lung cancer (cancer that arose from the lung tissue).
is there any link between breast cancer and lung cancer?
there are occassional strikes of lightening twice in the same patient but it is not due to a scientific link. breast cancer has no ling to smoking or tobacco and the link is very strong with lung cancer. we could stop 90% of lung cancer by cigarettes disappearing but we don't have that fortune with breast cancer. notice that cigarettes are still leader and many geniuses exercise their freedom.
if a breast cancer patient breast feeds her child will he be affected?
it is safe to breast feed after having breast cancer although the affected breast may not produce milk following radiation therapy. of course any medication you take including chemotherapy may be passed to your child in the breast milk; therefore your child's pediatrician needs to be aware of any medication you are taking before starting breastfeeding.
if a breast cancer patient breast feeds her child will he be affected?
in general patients being actively treated with chemotherapy should avoid breast feeding. always best to check with your oncologist.
if a woman has a sex change operation and becomes a man can she still get breast cancer?
i would imagine risk is much lower because of the mastectomies and removal of ovaries depending on stage of transformation.
if a woman has a sex change operation and becomes a man can she still get breast cancer?
yes. both men and women get breast cancer. the shutting off of the ovaries will decrease the estrogen production but the testosterone shots have their own issues. regardless the risk is still there.
is it harmful to stay on tamoxifen for 10 years?
tamoxifen is very useful for breast cancer patients for 5 years. many studies have proven that after that duration the side effects including uterine cancer may increase.
i have large breasts–approximately 42d– for a man. should i have a mammogram done western mark
you don't need a mammogram simply because you have large breasts/gynecomastia. however approx. 1% of breast cancer occurs in men so if you have a lump or other symptom see your doctor a mammo may be appropriate in that situation.

although controversial opposed estrogen (estrogen without progesterone) may increase your risk for breast cancer.
if i have too much estrogen or not enough progesterone does that make me more susceptible to breast cancer?
maybe: some breast cancers take up estrogen as a sort of growth hormone to encourage growth so too much estrogen can speed growth of these cancers. there is a very small increase in breast cancer risk with estrogen only given postmenopausally for the symptoms. relative increase in progesterone only is associated with some breast disorders also but cancer risk is unclear.
is soy milk safe for breast cancer patients?
the evidence is unclear but is most likely safe.
is soy milk safe for breast cancer patients?
it is unknown for estrogen receptor positive (er+) breast cancers. soy has estrogen-like properties. in lab studies some soy products have caused breast cancer cells to die while other products have caused the same cells to grow. i tell my patients not to take soy supplements in the form of extracts pills or powders but if they enjoy drinking soy milk they may do so in moderation.

is breast cancer contagious?
breast cancer develops as a result of both genetic predisposition and environmental exposures during life. it is understood to develop as a result of multiple variables in one's body based related to exposure to hormones as well as elements that we don't understand in some tumors. it has never been shown to b related to any infection or virus. it is not contagious or transferable to others.
is breast cancer contagious?
unlike infection breast cancer is not contagious disease. no need to worry that you may get cancer by being too close to somebody with breast cancer.
is having a prophylactic mastectomy a good idea for high-risk patients?
usually considered in patients with genetic predisposition by carrying the brca gene or that have a current breast cancer on 1 side. however be aware that even with a mastectomy there is still a small chance of getting a breast cancer. that is because not every single cell can be removed.
is having a prophylactic mastectomy a good idea for high-risk patients?
there are very few options for reducing the risk of breast cancer in women who are at high-risk. while quite extreme a double mast-x can significantly lower the risk of developing breast cancer. a simple blood test can be done to determine if a women is at high risk for developing the hereditary form of breast cancer. before having this brca test it is best to meet with a genetic counselor.
if it is treated are there any long-term effects of breast cancer?
the long term effects are related to the types of treatments that you may have undergone. surgery may have the risks of numbness limb swelling scarring. radiation carries the risk (although much smaller now) of causing a new cancer. and some chemotherapies have the risk of causing different types of blood cancers.
if it is treated are there any long-term effects of breast cancer?
by definition every cancer has the potential to return the probability of which is dependent upon the type and stage of that particular cancer. perhaps the greatest challenge for any breast cancer survivor is to learn to live with this risk and not allow it to control your life.
is there a less toxic alternative to chemotherapy for breast cancer treatment?
in some cases hormonal treatment can be as effective as chemotherapy. however if there is benefit from chemotherapy then it would be in addition to hormonal therapy. you should ask what percent benefit chemotherapy would give your circumstance and then decide if it's worth it to you to not accept that benefit.
is there a less toxic alternative to chemotherapy for breast cancer treatment?
brca tx may include chemo hormones radiation bone targeted tx & diet/exercise as "adjvuant" (post surgery) treatment. the combo needed depends on the tumor characteristics (grade stage hormone receptor status - er pr; and her2/neu status). non chemo tx can include hormones - eg tamoxifen arimidex (anastrozole) etc; trastuzumab (herceptin - anti her2 antibody). optimal therapy may include all those.
is there a less toxic alternative to chemotherapy for breast cancer treatment?
we look at each cancer's profile - estrogen / progesterone /her-2 receptors as well as histology-size grade blood vessel invasioneg then the patient herself age menopause status-if recepto pos. and older pt. ie postmenopausal we often treat with hormonal therapy - pills - that have a less severe side effect profile but still not without problems - osteoporosis uterine cancer catarats.
is there a less toxic alternative to chemotherapy for breast cancer treatment?
the vast majority (80-85%) of breast cancer is hormone sensitive/driven. pathology testing can determine if a tumor is er+. unless otherwise contraindicated all er+ patients should be considered for hormone therapy. if strongly er+ they may get more benefit from this than from chemotherapy. specialized testing (oncotype dx) is often used to determine if chemotherapy is still needed in er+ pt.
is breast cancer preventable?
you can lower the odds of developing breast cancer by limiting alcohol intake to no more than a drink or 2 per day (and mostly red wine) exercising regularly and keeping your weight under control.
is breast cancer preventable?
we are not able to control most risk factors for breast cancer such as being female aging and family history. we can control our weight as obesity is linked to an increased risk of breast cancer. in addition we can perform routine screening. early detection leads to the best chance of a cure. limit your alcohol intake have babies breast feed and increase your physical activity.
is breast cancer preventable?
our present knowledge is inadequate to prevent breast cancer but modifying certain personal habits like smoking alcohol high fat diets breast feeding avoiding exposure to bad environment avoiding hormones etc may reduce incident slightly but will not prevent completely.
is it possible for a 14 year old girl to get breast cancer?
breast cancer is very rare in women under 30 and increases in incidence the older you get. the statistical probabibility of having breast cancer at 14 is less than the probability of winning a million dollars in the lottery.
is it possible for a 14 year old girl to get breast cancer?
although very rare it is possible.
is it possible for a person with breast 'hypoplasia' get breast cancer?
breast size does not have a high degree of correlation with the risk of breast cancer. exercising regularly keeping weight under control and drinking in moderation are some things you can do to keep your risk lower.
is it possible for a person with breast 'hypoplasia' get breast cancer?
yes.
is it possible for a person with breast 'hypoplasia' get breast cancer?
everyone has breast tissue even males. the only requirement for having breast cancer is having breast tissue. it doesn't matter how much or how little you have.
is there an alernative to tamoxifen?
for breast cancer treatment aroma taste inhibitors are often used in place of tamoxifen only in post menopausal women.
is there an alernative to tamoxifen?
aromatase inhibitors are a class of drugs that have been found to be as or slightly more effective than tamoxifen for the treatment of estrogen-receptor + breast cancer patients; however its use is limited to post-menopausal women. tamoxifen is also used for breast cancer prevention; raloxifene is an acceptable alternative in most clinical situations.
is letrozole different from tamoxifen?
same general effect - decreases effects of estrogen and improves outcome in er + breast cancer. mechanism of action (how it works) is different. letrozole cannot be used in premenopausal women.
is letrozole different from tamoxifen?
tamoxifen is a selective estrogen receptor modulator; letrozole is an aromatase inhibitor. both drugs are used to treat hormone-positive breast cancer patients. however letrozole can only be used after menopause. furthermore tamoxifen can also be used to prevent breast cancer in high-risk women.
if i develop gynecomastia does that mean that i'm getting fat?
in fact if breast volume increases in a normal adult male below the age of 50 it is a good idea to seek medical attention. breast diseases (including breast cancer) may be erroneously attributed to "unilateral gynecomastia". hormonal disfunctions can present as gynecomastia as well as side effects of many medications. surgical treatment is very effective.
is there a natural fruit that can act like tamoxifen?
tamoxifen is a serm (selective estrogen receptor modulator) that is used to treat or even prevent certain types of breast cancer. it is a synthetic drug and is not found in any foods.
i have very small breasts naturally is it still possible to get breast cancer?
cancer can develop in breasts of any size.
i have very small breasts naturally is it still possible to get breast cancer?
yes.
is there a correlation between cervical dysplasia and breast cancer?
cervical dysplasia is associated with the human papilloma virus (hpv). as far as we know breast cancer is not associated with hpv or other viruses.
is there a correlation between cervical dysplasia and breast cancer?
there is not correlation. breast cancer is often associated with ovarian cancer especially in brca mutation carriers.
if you were diagnosed with breast cancer what is the chance of you getting ovarian cancer?
women with a personal history of breast cancer have a 3-fold increased risk of ovarian cancer. this association is even higher in women with a brca mutation who may have a15-45% risk of ovarian cancer.
if you were diagnosed with breast cancer what is the chance of you getting ovarian cancer?
if your breast cancer was caused by a mutation in the brca gene then your risk of ovarian cancer is greatly increased.
if you were diagnosed with breast cancer what is the chance of you getting ovarian cancer?
if there is no other significant risk factors that indicate possibility of having a particular genetical abnormality i. e. brca1 or 2 or lynch syndrome- such as- young age of cancer diagnosis or family history of ovarian breast cancer or other cancer such as uterine/colon etc in 1 or more generation- then the risk to have ovarian cancer will be the same as the general population.
is there a genetic test to see how long someone will survive with breast cancer?
many factors influence how long someone with breast cancer will survive but there is no genetic test that can predict this.
is there a genetic test to see how long someone will survive with breast cancer?
no there is not.
is there a genetic test to see how long someone will survive with breast cancer?
your survival with breast cancer primarily depends on how advanced the tumor is when it is diagnosed the tumor markers and how adequately it can be treated. genetic testing can be performed on the tumor to determine if it is a highly aggressive tumor or a less aggressive tumor. depending on the extent of the cancer gene testing may play some role in choosing therapy and predicting outcomes.
if two members of my immediate family developed breast cancer should i get tested for the brca gene?
it's always better to test the family members who have breast cancer if possible. if they are first degree relatives (mother daughter or sister) and one was under age 50 at diagnosis you might meet criteria for brca testing. it's best to meet with a genetic counselor who can help guide you and your family so the correct people are tested. there are non-brca mutations as well.
if two members of my immediate family developed breast cancer should i get tested for the brca gene?
women w/ 2+ immediate family members w/ a hx of breast/ovarian ca at 50% chance of developing breast cancer. if you have it get screened with ca-125 blood test ultrasound mammogram/mri usually starting at age 30. surgery after childbearing.
if two members of my immediate family developed breast cancer should i get tested for the brca gene?
it would depend on your heritage and also at what age were your immediate family members diagnosed. i would seek the advice of a genetic counselor.
if two members of my immediate family developed breast cancer should i get tested for the brca gene?
it would be best if the family member with the breast cancer gets brca testing. if it was positive then you definitely need to be tested too. if she was negative then the cancer was probably not related to brca gene mutations and you won't need to be tested. you still will be at higher for breast ca. if your family member was not willing or able to test then you may want to be tested.
if i have a mastectomy could that mean i won't need other treatment after surgery?
if the breast tumor is a ductal carcinoma or stage 0 breast cancer than you may not need further therapy. if it is stage 1 or more you may not need radiation. if it is high risk (lymph nodes involved triple negative high oncotype score) you may need chemo and if it is hormone sensitive you may also need a hormone blocker.
if i have a mastectomy could that mean i won't need other treatment after surgery?
a mastectomy might reduce the need for radiation treatment but if the cancer is very close to the edges of the removed breast or if there are many lymph nodes involved with cancer then radiation would still be recommended. the decision to use chemotherapy or hormonal therapy after mastectomy is strongly influenced by the type of breast cancer so can be complicated.
if cancer comes back in the same breast after having a breast-sparing surgery will i need a mastectomy then? will i be able to have breast reconstruction even though i have had radiation?
recurrence after radiation most often means mastectomy. unfortunately after radiation for breast cancer the tissue is changed in a way that limits the options for reconstruction. ordinarily the simplest method uses a tissue expander followed by an implant but radiated tissue doesn't expand well and capsular contracture is common. flaps such as diep or tram are preferable in that instance.
if cancer comes back in the same breast after having a breast-sparing surgery will i need a mastectomy then? will i be able to have breast reconstruction even though i have had radiation?
most women that suffer a recurrence of their breast cancer in the same breast after breast conservation (lumpectomy and radiation) go on to have a mastectomy. it is certainly possible to have breast reconstruction even though you have had previous radiation.
i have breast cancer in my family. should i choose the most aggressive treatment? should i have surgery to remove my healthy breast to keep from getting breast cancer in it? should i have genetic testing?
take a deep breath. you have time to decide these things. if your mother sister or daughter had breast cancer you have a higher risk of having a brca mutation. see a genetic counselor. if genetic testing is recommended do that right away. those results will help you make decisions about surgery and chemotherapy. my best advice: don't make decisions based on fear!
i have breast cancer in my family. should i choose the most aggressive treatment? should i have surgery to remove my healthy breast to keep from getting breast cancer in it? should i have genetic testing?
one of the most difficult situations my breast cancer patients face is when they are diagnosed with a cancer that could otherwise be treated by lumpectomy but a strong family history warrants consideration of double mastectomy. if this decision does not come easily to you i suggest having the lumpectomy and stage the cancer; if chemo is needed you will have months to decide re: double mast-x.
i have breast cancer in my family. should i choose the most aggressive treatment? should i have surgery to remove my healthy breast to keep from getting breast cancer in it? should i have genetic testing?
talk to your physician or a genetic counselor to decide if your family history suggests you have a > 10% chance of carrying a breast cancer gene. if so you should be tested. the results may help guide you as to how aggressive you should be with the management of your breasts and your ovaries.
i have breast cancer in my family. should i choose the most aggressive treatment? should i have surgery to remove my healthy breast to keep from getting breast cancer in it? should i have genetic testing?
hi as a doc who had triple negative breat cancer i am a bit less independent with my thinking. we don't know that much about breast cancer. get more than one opinion. do you have a breast cancer diagnosis? brca i and ii are genetic tests that can be done to indicate the likehood of certain types of breast cancer but these tests are not perfect indicators. consider genetic tesing.
i have breast cancer in my family. should i choose the most aggressive treatment? should i have surgery to remove my healthy breast to keep from getting breast cancer in it? should i have genetic testing?
being faced with a new cancer diagnosis can be overwhelming. pts are presented with lots of info and difficult options to consider. there are medical recs physicians can make but peace of mind on the pt's part plays an important role too. most importantly focus on optimum treatment for the cancer that has been diagnosed. preventing something that may (or more likely won't) later occur is 2nd.
i have large breasts and i've been having a strange pain in one of them. am i at increased risk of having breast cancer?
breast pain also called mastalgia is a common problem. women with large breasts sometimes have strain on the ligaments supporting the breasts which can cause pain. a more supportive bra sometimes helps. if pain persists or your breast becomes red or swollen you should see a healthcare provider.
i have large breasts and i've been having a strange pain in one of them. am i at increased risk of having breast cancer?
pain is not a common symptom of breast cancer. you risk depends on family history personal history estrogen replacements and other factors. you should discuss your concerns with your friend primary care physician.
i have large breasts and i've been having a strange pain in one of them. am i at increased risk of having breast cancer?
any new abnormal felling or lump should be evaluated. in general pain is related to noncancerous conditions but in some case there can be a cancer present. contact your pcp or gynecologist who can refer you to a breast surgeon general surgeon or a breast center.
is breast implant removal a must if i was diagnosed with breast cancer? i am having a very hard time dealing with my diagnosis of breast cancer. on top of that my doctor mentioned something about breast implant removal being necessary. i am not sure i wi
i wonder why your surgeon has recommended this. certainly you are entitled to obtain a second opinion. while i understand your reluctance for removal please take this into perspective and do not let the decision to retain your implant interfere with management of the tumor.

breast implant removal is not always necessary when surgery is being performed to treat breast cancer. whether or not breast implant removal will be indicated will depend on exactly what is planned in your breast cancer treatment. concerns that may come into play include size of the tumor location of the tumor in proximity to the position of the breast implant need for radiation therapy etc.
is breast implant removal a must if i was diagnosed with breast cancer? i am having a very hard time dealing with my diagnosis of breast cancer. on top of that my doctor mentioned something about breast implant removal being necessary. i am not sure i wi
i'm sorry about your new breast cancer diagnosis. the answer to your question is very dependent on the treatment plan for your cancer. having breast implants in place is not a big deal if mastectomy will be used as the primary treatment for the breast cancer. breast reconstruction can be performed at the time of the mastectomy. a large number of patients chose to undergo implant based reconstruction (vs flap surgery with your own tissue). reconstruction is a surgical process which means that patients will typically need more than 1 operation to complete the reconstruction. typically a tissue expander is placed at the time of mastectomy. the breast skin is expanded to a size that the patient is satisfied with. at a second operation the expander is then replaced with a long-term breast implant. the final result is similar to a natural breast. the goal is to make patients feel comfortable in their clothes. after your reconstruction is complete other people are unlikely to know that you ever had a mastectomy.

removal of a breast implant is not usually necessary for breast cancer treatment. when it is the reason should be made clear to you. ask you doctor why. i would assume that it is to provide you with the best care available. if they cannot provide a good reason seek another opinion. i recently removed a breast implant for cancer treatment using heat with chemotherapy. it was replaced afterward.

the reason for the production of breast milk can be attributed to the hormone therapy. however the production of breast milk can also be attributed to stress and other medications. seeing as your body underwent the stress of surgery and is on hormone therapy this side effect can be expected.
is it possible that 14 year old girls can develop breast cancer?
although it's pretty rare it is possible for a 14-year-old to have an invasive carcinoma of the breast; it's also possible for there to be a mistake or confusion in diagnosis.
is it possible that 14 year old girls can develop breast cancer?
while possible it would be extremely rare.
is it possible for men to get breast cancer?
male breast cancer is rare in contrast to female breast cancer. in the united states approximately 2140 new cases of mbc are diagnosed annually and 450 deaths occur. the median age of onset of male breast cancer is 65 to 67 approximately 5 to 10 years older than in women.
is it possible for men to get breast cancer?
men with a mother sister or daughter with breast or ovarian cancer or any male relatives with breast cancer especially with ashkenazi jewish heritage have a high risk of carrying a brca mutation. men with this mutation can get breast cancer in their 60s or later. they are at risk for other cancers as well. rarely men without a brca mutation get breast cancer usually at a later age.
is it possible for men to get breast cancer?
unfortunately most men don't do breast self-exam. in addition when the do find a lump they often wait a long time before seeking help hoping it will go away. for these reasons plus simple embarrassment they often present with more advanced disease than the cancers we see in females.
is it possible for men to get breast cancer?
1% of all breast cancers are male.
is it possible for men to get breast cancer?
because men have a small amount of breast tissue which can grow cancer.
is it possible for men to get breast cancer?
about 1% breast cancers occur in men.
is it possible for men to get breast cancer?
men can get breast cancer especially if they have an increased genetic risk. they can also transmit this increased risk to their offspring including both daughters and sons.
is it possible for men to get breast cancer?
men also get breast cancer but the incidence is much lower than women's.
is it possible for men to get breast cancer?
although breast cancer is not common in men it can happen. any new or changing lumps or bumps in the male breast should be evaluated by a healthcare provider.
is it possible for men to get breast cancer?
as a breast cancer specialist i see only 4 men per year with breast cancer i see many more with metastatic prostate lung lymphoma melanoma to the breast as a secondary site. therefore all lumps ulcerations bleeding and nipple discharge has to be explained even if they have to be dragged in by their significant other - otherwise they usually come in late with advanced stage.
is it possible for men to get breast cancer?
men get breast cnacer 10%as often as woman.
is it possible for men to get breast cancer?
it is fairly rare but does happen. it is more common in families who have the brca gene mutations.
i have silicone breast implants. is a mammogram just as good as an mri to check for breast cancer?
mri may be used in the detection of leaks in persons with silicone breast implants; however mammogram is the place to start for screening for breast ca. if indicated the radiologist or breast specialist may then order additional tests such as ultrasound or mri.
i have silicone breast implants. is a mammogram just as good as an mri to check for breast cancer?
with or without implants an mri is a more sensitive test for cancer than a mammogram. the problem is that mris are over 20x the cost of a mammogram. unless you are in a high risk category for breast cancer or there is a suspicion that your implants may be ruptured most insurers will not cover this expense.
i have silicone breast implants. is a mammogram just as good as an mri to check for breast cancer?
an mri is the best non-invasive test to check for cancer but a biopsy is the best way to check for cancer. however most physicians recommend that you begin with a stepwise approach starting with regular self examinations followed by routine mammograms and ultrasound if necessary than mri and/or guided biopsy to check for cancer.
i have silicone breast implants. is a mammogram just as good as an mri to check for breast cancer?
mammos are still the gold standard screening test for breast ca and implants don't change this. mris are more sensitive but have sensitivity issues (false positives). mris won't show microcalcifications which may be the 1st sign of malignancy. mris as a screening test is presently limited to high risk patients. mris for implant eval (? rupture) is done differently (no iv contrast).
i have silicone breast implants. is a mammogram just as good as an mri to check for breast cancer?
mammograms can reveal a certain amount of information about your breast tissue. there are limitations to what mammograms can show however with or without breast implants. mri is better to evaluate the entire breast chest wall lymph nodes and integrity of the implants. it is recommended that you have a breast mri every two years to evaluate the implants.
i have silicone breast implants. is a mammogram just as good as an mri to check for breast cancer?
breast mri with contrast has superior sensitivity to mammography. if you are talking about breast mri for implant assessment that is performed differently and it is not good for cancer detection. if you are getting mris for your implants you still need to get mammograms.
if my breast cancer has been completely removed after lumpectomy do i still need radiation therapy?
yes. when performing a lumpectomy our goal is to remove all of the tumor and a rim of normal breast tissue; the pathologist will describe this as "clear margins". however if radiation therapy(rt) is not given cancer may grow back in that area of the breast as often as 25% of the time. following rt the local recurrence rate is below 5%.
if my breast cancer has been completely removed after lumpectomy do i still need radiation therapy?
after lumpectomy it is standard treatment to receive radiation to the breast followed by a boost(few extra treatments) to the site of surgery. a tried and true recipe for the last 40 years. the local control rate is exceptional and the ladies keep their breasts! we all know the surgeons always "get it all"but we know from the trials that the role for radiation is still major <positive_smiley>.
if my breast cancer has been completely removed after lumpectomy do i still need radiation therapy?
the degree of residual disease in the breast after lumpectomy alone is significant. compared with surgery alone the addition of rt resulted a significant reduction in the 10-year risk of recurrence by nearly half and a significant reduction in the 15-year risk of breast cancer death by almost 20%. woman older than 70 with small (<2cm)er+ node negative breast ca adjuvant radiation is optional.
i am a breast cancer survivor since 2007. i had clear test results clear margins clear lymphnodes and bone scan in 2007. now i am having pain in hips. why could it be?
breast cancer survivors should alert their treating physicians as to any new bone pain.
i am a breast cancer survivor since 2007. i had clear test results clear margins clear lymphnodes and bone scan in 2007. now i am having pain in hips. why could it be?
if you are having pain in both hips it is unlikely that this pain is related to bone metastases from your breast cancer you had more than 6 years ago. hip arthritis or arthrosis is a possible explanation and an x-ray or a control radionuclide bone scan would be helpful to evaluate the cause of your bilateral hip pain.
i am a breast cancer survivor since 2007. i had clear test results clear margins clear lymphnodes and bone scan in 2007. now i am having pain in hips. why could it be?
if the pain is persistent and especially if it is worse at night with weight bearing or radiates from your back to your hips or your hips to your knees you should get checked out by your physician. if it is as simple as arthritis he or she may be able to help you feel better and you will likely be reassured having someone double check that the pain is not cancer related.
is alloderm with a tissue expander recommended at the time that my breast cancer tumor is removed? i am a 40-year-old woman diagnosed with right breast cancer. i do want to have the same size breasts again after treatment for breast cancer. is preparation
there are a lot of reconstructive options available to you and you should understand what each option entails before finalizing your decision regarding how to be reconstructed. what is your best option will be different from another patient and depends upon your overall health your body weight and the nature of your opposite breast.
is alloderm with a tissue expander recommended at the time that my breast cancer tumor is removed? i am a 40-year-old woman diagnosed with right breast cancer. i do want to have the same size breasts again after treatment for breast cancer. is preparation
it sounds like you have decided to have a mastectomy (removal of the entire breast) rather than a lumpectomy with radiation. this is a reasonable choice as both work just as well for curing most early breast cancers. if you have a mastectomy an immediate reconstruction at the time of the cancer operation can be done. often this is accomplished by placing a tissue expander that is slowy increased in size to stretch the skin and tissues over the chest and make enough space to put in a new artificial breast implant a few months later. many plastic surgeons are now using some alloderm over the tissue expander as well to provide a surface for the new skin to grow in and also help get the area to the correct size more easily. i have seen many patients with excellent cosmetic outcomes with this procedure. there is really no special preparation that needs to be done before the operation. the main considerations in deciding whether to proceed with this type of reconstruction or not are: 1) what is the chance that radiation therapy will be needed after surgery? if it is likely that radiation will be necessary the tissue expander reconstruction route can still be done but you need to discuss the implications of the radiation on the reconstruction with all your doctors. 2) what is the chance that you have a breast cancer susceptibiilty gene that would predispose you to getting a cancer on the other side? sometimes genetic testing should be done before surgery to help you decide if you should have both breasts removed and get both reconstructed at the same time.
im sixteen years old and have found a lump in my breastcould it be breast cancer?
eventhough it is possible your age is too young for typical presentation. other non-malignant conditions are more likely the cause. see a doctor.
im sixteen years old and have found a lump in my breastcould it be breast cancer?
while this is a possibility it is highly unlikely. benign breast masses are very common in young women. in particularly thin women normal breast tissue can feel like a mass. pay close attention and do not ignore and discuss with your primary care physician. call sooner for a changing or growing mass or one associated with discharge
im sixteen years old and have found a lump in my breastcould it be breast cancer?
an overwhelming majority of breast lumps in teenagers are benign tumors called fibroadenomas. i recommend that you tell your parents what you have found so that they can schedule an appointment with your pediatrician. they will likely order a painless test (an ultrasound) and refer you to a breast specialist to seek out their opinion.
is it advisable not to get involved with a girl who has had breast cancer before for health reasons?
1 in 8 women get breast cancer. if your partner has had breast cancer there is no health risk to you. women who have had breast cancer have strength insight and perspective that other women may not have. but if you are not ready to love someone in sickness and in health and support that person through something like cancer you aren't ready for a serious relationship.
is it advisable not to get involved with a girl who has had breast cancer before for health reasons?
one misconception is that cancer is contagious. this is false. there are no health related reasons one can not have a meaningful and serious relationship with a cancer survivor.
is it advisable not to get involved with a girl who has had breast cancer before for health reasons?
following treatment the chance of breast cancer returning is quite variable but always a risk. many of my cancer patients tell me that living with this risk is more difficult than the treatment they endured. cancer survivors need a very strong support system; if you are not up to that challenge it is best to answer that now.
i want to know what is the difference between mammogram and ultrasound when it comes to breast cancer detection?
mammograms are images obtained by compressing the breast and exposing the breast tissue to x rays from several directions. various findings on these x ray images could be a sign of cancer. ultrasound images are obtained by sending high frequency sound waves into (breast) tissue and capturing reflected sound waves back. these are then used to generate an image. breast cancer can often be detected.
i want to know what is the difference between mammogram and ultrasound when it comes to breast cancer detection?
rely on difference between tumor and tissue (not there in the 15% with inv lobular ca until quite large) requires compression (universally hated) and leads to u/s for biopsy direction and sometimes mr. 3 tests: one relatively insensitive one not reliably reproducible 1 fraught with false positive.
i want to know what is the difference between mammogram and ultrasound when it comes to breast cancer detection?
a mammogram is an excellent (and inexpensive) screening test meaning that it is designed to find cancers too small to detect by palpation. in contrast ultrasounds are diagnostic tests meaning they are helpful to determine whether an abnormality seen on a mammogram (or exam) is worthy of a biopsy. for example one can only distinguish a cyst from a tumor by ultrasound.
if you had breast cancer and took chemo can you tan in a tanning bed without harming yourself?
due to skin cancer risks of tanning beds i am in agreement with ben ferguson who states that there is no exposure to tanning beds that is safe or harmless chemo or no chemo.
if you had breast cancer and took chemo can you tan in a tanning bed without harming yourself?
tanning is not safe and is not recommended for anyone. it increases the risk of skin cancer and accelerates facial and body aging. sunscreen with titanium and zinc can help protect you from uva and uvb rays but avoiding sun exposure is best. spray tanning and tanning lotions are a reasonable alternative to achieve a bronzed look but they may not be safe for pregnant/ lactating women.
if you had breast cancer and took chemo can you tan in a tanning bed without harming yourself?
cancer doctors do not recommend tanning booths or sun tanning because there is the risk of causing skin cancer many years later. the worst one being melanoma. most chemo drugs would allow you to tan if you wanted however there are some that sensitize the skin and you need to ask your medical oncologist. i don't recommend tanning for anybody.
i'm just wondering if you were diagnosed with breast cancer is the chance of you getting ovarian cancer high?
there are rare genetic syndromes that increase your chances of getting both breast and ovarian cancers (the best known are mutations in the brca genes). however these mutations account for only about 10% of the cases of breast or ovarian cancer.
i'm just wondering if you were diagnosed with breast cancer is the chance of you getting ovarian cancer high?
individuals of european jewish descent have a much higher risk of brca 1 & 2 mutations than the general population and having relatives or family members with breast cancer or ovarian cancer especially under the age of 50 should consider genetic testing. this should be discussed with your gynecologist. yes men in these families can be at risk as well.
if mri better of mammogram? what procedures do the least damage?
mri and mammography are complementary exams. a screening mammogram is and should be a woman's first exam. if there is a need for additional workup as determined by the radiologist who interprets the screening study then you may be sent for an additional test (ultrasound mri bsgi depending on the suspected finding). an mri if requested by the mammogram findings can help better characterize a breast abnormality. it can better evaluate a woman with dense breasts. and it can evaluate the other breast in a woman with a known breast cancer in one breast. a mammogram exposes a woman to a tiny amount of ionizing radiation. an mri is obtained using magnetic fields also a type of radiation but not the kind that we see discussed so often in conjunction with cancer potential.
i had lymph nodes taken out after i had breast cancer in my left breast. why can't my blood pressure be taken on that side?
the theory is you could cause lymphedema by squeezing the lymph channels with a blood pressure cuff. however there has never been a study to actually see if this happens and i think it's more myth than fact. i tell patients with bilateral mastectomies it's ok to have their blood pressure taken and no one has ever developed lymphedema from it. if you already have lymphedema i would avoid.
i had lymph nodes taken out after i had breast cancer in my left breast. why can't my blood pressure be taken on that side?
sometimes after surgery it's harder for lymph fluid to drain out of your arm. if the fluid builds up your arm swells ["lymphedema"]. measuring blood pressure on your right arm can help prevent this swelling. here's to your healing! other ways to prevent lymphedema can be found here: <link>
i had lymph nodes taken out after i had breast cancer in my left breast. why can't my blood pressure be taken on that side?
the risk of clinically significant lymphedema after full axillary node dissection is 20-25%. with the more common sentinel node biopsy procedure less surgery and fewer nodes removed = significantly less risk but not 0. nodal surgery and scarring may affect lymph channels draining fluid from the arm. the bp cuff increases pressure in the lymph channels causing stress to the system increasing le risk.
i had lymph nodes taken out after i had breast cancer in my left breast. why can't my blood pressure be taken on that side?
you are at increased chance of developing lymphedema ( arm swelling since your lymphatics are not draining well). taking blood pressure increases the pressure in adjacent vessels that can cause fluid built up in tissue. take good care of your skin to avoid infections. avoid getting iv or injections in that arm as well.
i had lymph nodes taken out after i had breast cancer in my left breast. why can't my blood pressure be taken on that side?
image the lymph system as a lacy network of canals that help drain fluid out of the arm. lymph node biopsy interferes with the drainage system. anything that causes swelling in your arm including 'back pressure' of a blood pressure cuff can cause swelling in the lymph system in the armpit- and increase chance of chronic-permanent swelling in entire arm. doesn't always happen but it is possible.
i had lymph nodes taken out after i had breast cancer in my left breast. why can't my blood pressure be taken on that side?
because of possibly accentuating lymphedema.
is it ever recommended to "take a break" from the 5 years of tamoxifen if it might be causing depression?
i think there are 2 issues. 1) optimal breast cancer adjuvant hormone treatment. at 5 yrs of tam it might (if post menopausal) be a good time to switch to an aromatase inhibitor (ai) or the absolute benefit of >5yrs of tam or ai may be limited (depends on cancer characteristics). 2) is it depression or something else. if depression is it from tam or? . it could be that counseling +/- rx is needed.
is it ever recommended to "take a break" from the 5 years of tamoxifen if it might be causing depression?
depression as a side effect can be easily and successfully treated. a breast cancer recurrence is a lot tougher to deal with.
if a breast cancer patient undergoes neo-adjuvant chemotherapy how will she ever know her true nodal status?
it is somewhat controversial when to perform sentinel lymph node (ln) biopsy in this setting: some advocate performing this prior to chemo so as to determine an accurate stage; others believe that the status of the ln after chemo is most pertinent. in my practice i will perform a needle-biopsy of any abnormal ln prior to chemo. if none are evident i wait until after chemo.
if a breast cancer patient undergoes neo-adjuvant chemotherapy how will she ever know her true nodal status?
i used to always ask surgeons to do a sentinel node biopsy before neoadjuvant chemotherapy for that very reason. however newer data show the lymph node status after chemotherapy may be more important. newer data also show that women don't always need a full axillary dissection with a few positive nodes so i'm ok with either approach if the lymph nodes aren't enlarged to start.
if a breast cancer patient undergoes neo-adjuvant chemotherapy how will she ever know her true nodal status?
with neoadj therapy prognostic infor of staging after therapy is likely the more telling. studies show slnbx after chemo still accurately predicts axillary nodal status. with current chemo a 20-25% pcr is not unexpected and would include clearing previously pos nodes (found clinically or on prechemo ax u/s & fna). delaying the slnbx can thus spare these patients additional axillary surgery.
if i am still having regular menstrual cycles while on tamoxifen is there a chance the tamoxifen isn't really doing it's job?
tamoxifen is an estrogen receptor modulator and is not intended to suppress the ovaries. it is intended to block the estrogen receptors so that estrogen cannot bind and stimulate that particular tissue - usually tamoxifen is used to block stimulation of breast tissue in patients with estrogen receptor positive breast cancer. tamoxifen is not intended to stop you from having normal cycles.
i have had a mammogram and it is not cancer but i have a lump in my left breast that feels like a pin sticking me. i am a 59 year old male they said it is like i am growing breast.
men can grow breast tissue is some circumstances. this condition is called gynecomastia. it warrants investigation not because it's breast cancer or makes you more likely to get breast cancer but because it can indicate an underlying medical problem. liver disease for instance will frequently cause gynecomastia. i would suggest that you discuss this with your regular doctor who will probably want to do a few blood tests.
i am experiencing pain under my armpits down to the breasts. i hear if there is pain then i shouldn't worry about breast cancer so what could that be?
several questions must be answered before diagnosis can be made [exam also necesssary]: what initiates the pain? what makes it better? is it throbbing constant intermittent stabbing? how intense on a scale of 1-10? how long does it last each time? how often occurring? any lumps in armpits? any back trouble? is the skin normal? age of the patient? any health issues? any medicines prescribed?
i am experiencing pain under my armpits down to the breasts. i hear if there is pain then i shouldn't worry about breast cancer so what could that be?
since you have symptoms on both sides i'm not worried about breast cancer. have you been exercising your arms/chest? if so you could have a muscle strain. women with large breasts can also develop a strain of cooper's ligaments which causes pain in the armpits to chest/breasts. if this sounds like you try wearing a more supportive bra. see your doctor if things don't improve.
i am experiencing pain under my armpits down to the breasts. i hear if there is pain then i shouldn't worry about breast cancer so what could that be?
breast tissue extends into the armpit. it is common to experience pain here as fibrocystic change (fcc). fcc is the most common cause of breast pain. it is less common for breast cancer to cause pain-but not impossible. you should get evaluated by your doctor to be certain.
if my father himself had a male form of breast cancer his mom and sister both also do i have a high risk?
the pattern of breast cancer incidence in your family points towards the hereditary form of breast cancer. in general we advise doing a braca analysis for one of the members of your family who had breast ca. if your father has the mutation there is a 50% chance that you inherited this.
if my father himself had a male form of breast cancer his mom and sister both also do i have a high risk?
a strong family history especially one that includes a male breast cancer is a red flag for a possible gene mutation like brca 1 or 2 that is associated with a very high risk of breast cancer. your father should have genetic testing. if his test is positive you have a 50% chance of inheriting it from him. if he is positive and you are negative then your risk isonly the same as any woman.
if my father himself had a male form of breast cancer his mom and sister both also do i have a high risk?
a family history of breast cancer is a very high risk factor for developing it or other cancers yourself. the fact that there is a male case in a 1st degree relative makes it even more likely that a particular gene(brca) for the disease is in your family. your family doctor can discuss with you a plan to monitor you and discuss if you need genetic testing/counseling.
i have finished treatment for stages 3 breast cancer. how often should i be tested to ensure the cancer hasn't returned?
talk to your oncologist. i tend to see patients every 3 months for physical and labs. sooner if any concern arises.
i have finished treatment for stages 3 breast cancer. how often should i be tested to ensure the cancer hasn't returned?
the follow up plan for breast cancer is a good history and physical every 3-6 months for the first 2 years then every 6 months until 5 years then yearly. it is not recommended to do a lot of scans as survival is equivalent for patients we routinely scan versus those that we follow as recommend above. a mammogram is recommended on affected breast 6 months after radiation then yearly.
i have finished treatment for stages 3 breast cancer. how often should i be tested to ensure the cancer hasn't returned?
your oncologist will lay out your follow up schedule.
it's it okay for me to take spironolactone if i have a family history of breast cancer? i know it affects hormone levels.
spironolactone increases free estrogen levels in the blood and decreases androgen effects and in men can cause breast growth. there are no studies that have looked at this question. my best answer is that theoretically it may increase your risk as estrogen plays a role in breast cancer development. but if you need spironolactone you should probably take it.
it's it okay for me to take spironolactone if i have a family history of breast cancer? i know it affects hormone levels.
while spironolactone can cause development of breast tissue in males i am not aware of any special concern in somebody with a family history of breast cancer. let us see if any one else has a different opinion.
if your parent had breast cancer what are my chances of getting cancer?
the risk solely from a 1st degree relative is about 2. 5-4x's. the gail model is a validated calculator that was used for the largest prevention trials (p-1 p-2) and is available on the nci website which gives a 5 year and life time (through age 90) risk looking at various factors (age menstrual history findings on prior biopsies and 1st degree relatives) and normals for comparison.
if your parent had breast cancer what are my chances of getting cancer?
the age that your parent developed breast cancer as well as the number of their relatives with cancer is important. in general a younger age at diagnosis makes it more likely that you might develop breast cancer. in addition if your mother and especially your father had breast cancer and tested positive for a brca gene mutation you have a 50% risk of having that mutation and should be tested.
if your parent had breast cancer what are my chances of getting cancer?
agree with dr. attai. see if anyone else in family has had breast ovarian cervical uterine prostate colon gallbladder pancreatic transitional cell (ureter some kidney) especially if multiple family members across generations and/or if cancers were at early ages. risk factors? several studies show that alcohol intake (any type) can be an aggravating risk factor. u may want to limit it.
if my breast cancer feed off estrogen bein a female how can i reduce it in my body?
if you have been diagnosed with hormone-receptor positive breast cancer you should be on a medication to either block estrogen (tamoxifen) or if you are post-menopausal to decrease the level of estrogen in your body (letrozole anastrazole or exemestane). you can lose weight if you are obese which will also decrease the estrogen in your body. however anti-estrogen drugs are very important!
if my breast cancer feed off estrogen bein a female how can i reduce it in my body?
breast cancer is associated with prolonged high estrogen levels (early menarche late menopause children later in life estrogen replacement rx) not caused meaning it's not a simple relationship. if you are trying to prevent breast cancer a low-fat diet is advisable which may keep estrogen levels down. for ca rx anti-estrogens such as tamoxifen may counteract the estrogen.
if my breast cancer feed off estrogen bein a female how can i reduce it in my body?
i agree with the other docs: you should be taking anti-estrogens. but it also helps to avoid xenoestrogens which come in many forms. phytoestrogens are in soy and other plant foods; hormone-treated dairy products contain estrogens and "female" supplements like evening primrose oil are potent sources. bpas from plastics mimic estrogen in the body; get a metal water bottle!
if my breast cancer feed off estrogen bein a female how can i reduce it in my body?
iodine blocks estrogen receptors - take orally 13. 8 mg per day available as iodozyme with biotics need 2pills comes as 6. 25mg.
is vaginal bleeding after intercourse normal? i've been bleeding profusely afte intercourse (about 36 hours) with no pain. history of pcos last pap (normal) 7 months ago gave birth vaginally 19 months ago family history of breast cancer
i would advise you to go see a gynecologist and be examined and make sure there is no other cause for vaginal bleeding such as a benign or malignant lesion in the vagina or on the cervix.
is vaginal bleeding after intercourse normal? i've been bleeding profusely afte intercourse (about 36 hours) with no pain. history of pcos last pap (normal) 7 months ago gave birth vaginally 19 months ago family history of breast cancer
the source of vaginal bleeding after sex is most commonly from the cervix - the part of the uterus that hangs into your vagina. it is most likely just cervical irritation from the friction of sex. as long as you are premenopausal (which you are) the bleeding is infrequent and you have normal regular pap smears then you don't have to see your doctor for it. if you are postmenopausal have bleeding that is heavy or every time you have sex or if you have had abnormal paps smears in the past you should see your doctor to rule out more serious causes such as cervical cancer.
i am currently doing radiation therapy for breast cancer. what kind of deodorant can i use?
ask your radiation oncologist or the therapist. they get this question a lot. it depends on where the radiation fields are located your reaction to the radiation and the doc's personal preferences. you want to avoid irritation.
i am currently doing radiation therapy for breast cancer. what kind of deodorant can i use?
the effects of radiation alter the skin. the skin can become irritated itself by the radiation. today there is much less likelihood of "burns". but still washing yourself with a mild antibacterial soap and gently drying the area is the most you can do; unless the radiation oncologist tells you a different method. the skin is sensitive.
i have always heard that sleeping with a bra on can cause breast cancer is this true?
sleeping with a bra on will not cause breast cancer.
i have always heard that sleeping with a bra on can cause breast cancer is this true?
it is not true that sleeping with a bra on causes breast cancer. it's good for your breasts to have good circulation like all parts of your body so wear a bra that fits well and does not bind you anywhere.
i have always heard that sleeping with a bra on can cause breast cancer is this true?
this was invented by a lone anti-brassiere crackpot in the mid-1990's. it's now all over the internet. it's simply made up. ignore it.
i have always heard that sleeping with a bra on can cause breast cancer is this true?
whether you wear a bra all the time or none of the time or anything in between - has nothing tyo do with developing breast cancer.
i have always heard that sleeping with a bra on can cause breast cancer is this true?
there has been no scientific evidence that sleeping with a bra on causes cancer of any kind including breast cancer.
is there a generally recommended age for a post menopausal woman with no family history of breast cancer to stop hrt?
usually 5 years.
is there a generally recommended age for a post menopausal woman with no family history of breast cancer to stop hrt?
the current recommendations are to stop hormone replacement therapy in 5 years depending on symptoms and circumstances.
is there a generally recommended age for a post menopausal woman with no family history of breast cancer to stop hrt?
there is no recommended age. the american colllege of ob-gyn recommends using hrt as short of a time as needed to control symptoms. this will be different for every woman. a recent study came out showing that the average length if time from menopause onset to the end of hot flushes is about 10 years but again there is much variance between people.
if i don't have children till after 30 does that increase my cancer rates for breast cancer?
20 percent lower if the first birth was at age 20 10 percent lower for first birth at age 25 and 5 percent higher if the first birth was at age 35. the risk for a nulliparous woman is similar to that of a woman with a first full term birth at age 30.
if i don't have children till after 30 does that increase my cancer rates for breast cancer?
the most important risk factors for breast cancer are being female and being older. breast cancer is relatively common in women over 60 and very rare in women less than 30 for example. the other important risk factor is having one or more immediate family members with bc. not having children or having them late in life increases your risk a little bit. check out the gail model online.
is paget's disease of breast curable?
like other types of breast cancer with prompt and appropriate treatment there is a good likelihood that paget's disease can be successfully treated.
is the radical mastectomy a risky thing to do?
yes but not having a radical mastectomy when it's called for would be far riskier. any surgery carries risk and a mastectomy is no different but those risks are far smaller than the risk of a spreading breast cancer. by the way if you're concerned that a radical mastectomy is more than you need for your cancer you can and should always seek a second opinion.
if you get breast carcinoma how do you feel?
a breast cancer can grow for about 8 to 10 years before it reaches 1 centimeter in diameter - about 3/8's of an inch. a breast cancer that size would likely have no symptoms at all and would be unlikely to be detected on a breast exam by you or your doctor. however a breast cancer could show up on a mammogram years before it reaches even 1 centimeter in size. do your mammograms as recommended.
if you get breast carcinoma how do you feel?
most women with early-stage breast cancer have no symptoms at all. if the cancer has spread to other organs and is not treated it can eventually cause symptoms in the affected organ (bone pain breathing problems etc). chemotherapy and radiation therapy have their own side effects such as hair loss lethargy etc but the benefit of cure outweighs the short-term side effects.
i always forget to ask my doctor about how to prevent breast carcinoma. are there some steps i should be taking?
low fat diet and keeping your weight down may help. avoid a lot of alcohol. probably should not take estrogen replacement continually for many years. remember that 1 in 7 women get breast cancer - and most can't be prevented. get your mammograms. in this case early detection is a reality and prevention is only a hope.
i always forget to ask my doctor about how to prevent breast carcinoma. are there some steps i should be taking?
about 1 in 8 women will develope breast cancer. there is probably little that you can do to decrease that risk. however besides family history as a risk factor fo breast cancer - there is some increased risk in smokers drinkers and overweight women - factors you can modify to effect some decrease in your risk for breast cancer. for early detection do you mammograms as recommended.
i wanted to know your opinion about breast enhancement pills serums and creams. esp triactol breast actives and beauti-full i'm eighteen years old and i'm super self-conscious about my bust and have really considered using an natural enhancers. i want
the use of hormones for male to female trangenders is well accepted. there use in women is considerably more controversial due to the potential risk of promoting breast cancer. in fact hormone blocking drugs are commonly used to treat women with breast cancer to limit growth. other homeopathic drugs have been used but their effectiveness and safety is not accepted nor verified.
if you have chemo for breast cancer do you lose your hair?
chemotherapy generally affects growing cells. cells of the hair follicle are continuously growing and thus generally adversely affected by chemotherapy.
if you have chemo for breast cancer do you lose your hair?
it depends on type of chemotherapeutic agent used.
is tamoxifen safe and can i take it? i am a 67-year-old white female living alone. last year i had early catch stage-1 breast cancer. i next had a lumpectomy and only one treatment of chemotherapy. i was scheduled for four treatments. the side affects
if your breast cancer was estrogen receptor-negative then you will not benefit from hormonal adjuvant therapy like tamoxifen (actually women who are past their menopause should be on arimidex (anastrozole) not tamoxifen) either way you will not benefit from those since your mass is estrogen receptor negative. at 67 you should probably still get radiation as you still have a long life ahead of you. especially with stage 1 cancer. you have to discuss these options with a breast surgeon.
is tamoxifen safe and can i take it? i am a 67-year-old white female living alone. last year i had early catch stage-1 breast cancer. i next had a lumpectomy and only one treatment of chemotherapy. i was scheduled for four treatments. the side affects
it sounds as if your cancer was hormonally sensitive which is a good thing since it has a more favorable prognosis long term at least in part because of your ability to take some of these hormone manipulating drugs. it is unusual for an oncologist to reccomend tamoxifen though in someone who has likely gone through menopause. after menopause it is recommended to take an aromatase inhibitor.
is tamoxifen safe and can i take it? i am a 67-year-old white female living alone. last year i had early catch stage-1 breast cancer. i next had a lumpectomy and only one treatment of chemotherapy. i was scheduled for four treatments. the side affects
tamoxifen is one of the safest medicines to take. it does a lot of good to keep breast cancer under control.
is tamoxifen safe and can i take it? i am a 67-year-old white female living alone. last year i had early catch stage-1 breast cancer. i next had a lumpectomy and only one treatment of chemotherapy. i was scheduled for four treatments. the side affects
if you are postmenopause aromatase inhibitors are recommended. tamoxifen is occasionally used under case-specific circumstances in post-menopausal women. regardless of age if the tumor is er - no antihormone treatment is recommended.
i always have pain with mammograms. should i ask for a sonogram instead?
mammograghy is still the best procedure we have for detecting early breast cancer in our population. ultrasound and breast mri are very useful in the appropriate setting but are not the best for screening and cannot "replace" an annual mammogram. unfortunately compression of the breast is necessary for optimum images and can be uncomfortable for some.
is it a sign of breast cancer? my left breast occasionally leaks a sticky like clearish substance that looks yellow and crusty when it dries. occasionalyy it bleeds only slightly. and leaves flakes. on the nipple. i do have severe ezcema. this has been lea
nipple discharge can be caused by a malignant lesion if it is spontaneous ie comes out on its own or is bloody if the discharge is milky and only comes out with stimulation then it is benign and i would not be concerned it usually will stop on ts own mention t to your gyn at your next visit.

the possibilities of what this could be are wide. you need a breast exam by a specialist.
if a woman has unequal breast sizes does the larger breast have a higher chance of getting breast cancer (just because it's bigger)?
there is no correlation between the risk of breast cancer and the size of one's breast.
if a woman has unequal breast sizes does the larger breast have a higher chance of getting breast cancer (just because it's bigger)?
the answer to my knowledge is no. size of breast has nothing to do the chances of getting cancer in the breast.
if a woman has unequal breast sizes does the larger breast have a higher chance of getting breast cancer (just because it's bigger)?
many women will have asymmetric breasts- one would be smaller or bigger than the other. it is normal by the way. just because the size is bigger does not mean the risk is higher. size does not have anything to do with the risk for developing breast cancer.
i know that breast cancer in men is rare but do men with manboobs have a higher rate of breast cancer than men with no manboobs?
men can have prominent breast tissue due to obesity (lipomastia) or a condition where there is increased glandular tissue--gynecomastia. it is often stated that gynecomastia is associated with increased risks of breast cancer but no study has ever proven this. we do know however that high estrogen states can increase the risk of breast cancer in men (or women) and can be a cause of gynecomastia.
i know that breast cancer in men is rare but do men with manboobs have a higher rate of breast cancer than men with no manboobs?
the size does not have anything to do with the risk for developing cancer.
if a man gets breast cancer does he first have to have a lump of non-cancerours breast gland material under the nipple (that later turns cancerous? )?
all men have breast tissue yet this tissue may not be palpable as a defined lump under the nipple. breast cancer begins at a microscopic level and does not require palpable breast tissue in order to form. some men have a condition where there is pathologic enlargement of their breast tissue--gynecomastia. although controversial this does seem to predispose one to breast cancer.
if a man gets breast cancer does he first have to have a lump of non-cancerours breast gland material under the nipple (that later turns cancerous? )?
man can have a mass that is cancerous as his initial presentation - does not have to have a benign nodule first.
if mammogram suggests cancer at 85 will most women die from it or with it?
generally speaking breast cancer at older age tends to be less aggressive. if mammogram shows suspicious disease regardless of age it has to be biopsied to confirm. if it's early stage cancer paritial mastectomy may be adequate and depending on the pathology she may just need some oral antiestrogen pill. radiation may not be necessary but again it depdends on a lot of factors. very treatable.
im 16 years old do i have breast cancer? mom did
even with family history it would extremely rare for a 16 year-old to have breast cancer. please consult with your doctor to ascertain your risk for breast cancer and learn self examination.
im 16 years old do i have breast cancer? mom did
the odds of getting breast cancer as a teen is less than 1 in a million. have you spoken to your mom about your fears? hopefully she has a large support group that can also help educate you about this disease and alleviate some of your concerns.
im 16 years old do i have breast cancer? mom did
you are only 16 years enjoy do what you want to do with your life talk to your family about your fears worry 30 years from now then their will be cure.
i'm taking diane-35 for acne but i'm worried about side effects can it really cause breast cancer? and do you recommend this pill overall?
i always offer ocps (oral contraceptive pills) as therapy for women with acne. there is always risk with any medicine but i don't think ocps cause breast cancer. if you have family risk you should consult with your doctor before taking it.
i'm taking diane-35 for acne but i'm worried about side effects can it really cause breast cancer? and do you recommend this pill overall?
hi smileyface. it would be difficult for a physician to recommend or not recommend a certain treatment in a forum such as this. diane-35 is a hormone treatment that may increase your risk of breast cancer.
i am 71. at age 62 i had her2 positive and er positive breast cancer with 6 positive nodes out of 16 . what are the odds of return of breast cancer?
you are in pretty good territory 9 years after the diagnosis and treatment of breast cancer. you should have been on antiestrogen therapy for a minimum of 5 years and probably for a full 10 years. although breast cancer is known to occur more than 20 years after it is first diagnosed this is unusual.
i am 71. at age 62 i had her2 positive and er positive breast cancer with 6 positive nodes out of 16 . what are the odds of return of breast cancer?
it is hard to give you a number under any circumstance but especially without the knowledge of your treatment. as you probably learned 9 years ago women with 4 or more lns involved and her2/neu(+) disease are at high risk for recurrence. nevertheless recurrences in her2/neu patients tend to occur within the first 5-10 years. so at 9yrs we should be optimistic that you will continue to do well.
i am a 26 year old male and i have a lump in my breast. can it be breast cancer or gynecomastia?
probably gynecomastia. but a biopsy with review by a pathologist would help solidify the diagnosis.
i am a 26 year old male and i have a lump in my breast. can it be breast cancer or gynecomastia?
best way to tell is by a mammogram and biopsy (needle vs open ) see a plastic surgeon or general surgeon for consultation.
i am a 26 year old male and i have a lump in my breast. can it be breast cancer or gynecomastia?
a lump in the male breast is usually breast tissue and is then called gynecomastia. the vast majority of these lumps are benign or non-cancerous. rarely a lump could be a cancer so have it examined by your physician.
i am a 26 year old male and i have a lump in my breast. can it be breast cancer or gynecomastia?
gynecomastia is common in infancy adolescence and in middle-aged to older adult males. pseudogynecomastia is also common and related to the heavy weight. gynecomastia must be differentiated from breast carcinoma which is far less common. there are a lot of cause of gynecomastia including drug puberty endocrine problems liver/kidney problems etc. see your doctor and have your self checked.
i had dreams that more lumps developed in my breasts. what should i do? mammogram?
you need a mammogram if you or your doctor feels a lump in your breasts or you are over 40. if you have a 1st degree relative such as mother or sister with breast cancer you can choose to start your mammograms when you are 10 years younger than the age your relative was diagnosed or at age 40 whatever comes first. i once had a dream i could fly so should i jump off the grand canyon?
i'm having acute pain from my radical mastectomy surgery wednesday. normal? i have high risk breast cancer
it is normal to have some level of pain for the next few weeks after your sugery. i recommend you contact your surgeon and be evaluated.
i'm having acute pain from my radical mastectomy surgery wednesday. normal? i have high risk breast cancer
you r expected to have some pain often worse 2-3 days following the procedure because of inflammation of the traumatized tissues. if if the pain is too severe you should contact your surgeon for instruction. possible increase of pain meds or re-eval for possible infection etc. i wish you well on your course to recovery! good luck.
i'm having acute pain from my radical mastectomy surgery wednesday. normal? i have high risk breast cancer
acute pain post-surgery is not normal. contact your doctor. "high risk" breast cancer is no reason for acute pain.
is it likely that this is breast cancer if they call you back for x-rays after a mammogram?
it is more likely that you are fine. depending on the center you are seen at recall rates vary from 1 in 20 to 1 in 10. of those recalled approximately 15% will need biopsy and of those biopsied 20% will be cancer. these numbers are from research studies and may not reflect the performance of your local mammography center.
is it likely that this is breast cancer if they call you back for x-rays after a mammogram?
screening mmgs involve 2 quick views - one from the top and one from the side. depending on how hard they pull or squeeze or position the breast tissue can overlap and look more dense. with additional compression this spreads out and disappears thus benign. if its a true mass the surrounding tissue thins and the mass becomes more obvious. characteristics of calcs are better seen on mag views.
is it likely that this is breast cancer if they call you back for x-rays after a mammogram?
often they need to change the compression/ include areas they missed to get it perfect -that should be done while you are still in the mammo. room -sometimes they bring you back for mag views for calcifications to assess their number/shape or compress an area of distortion/overlapping shadows - vessels- ducts -cooper's ligaments or do an ultrasound to see if a mass is a cyst. 1st call is? bx needed.
is it likely that this is breast cancer if they call you back for x-rays after a mammogram?
sometimes we need a second more detailed look at a "spot" or calcification in the breast with different xray views. this helps us decide if you need to do nothing more tests a biopsy or 6 month repeat mammogram. also if you have any mammograms performed at a different imaging center please try to get those films for the radiologist to compare and see any changes over time in your breasts.
is it likely that this is breast cancer if they call you back for x-rays after a mammogram?
the opposite. at least 80% of the time these recalls turn out to be nothing of concern.
if a man has breast cancer at 60 does he get plastic surgery on the other side also?
a patient with breast cancer can have plastic surgery to reconstruct the breasts regardless of gender or age insofar as their is no medical contraindication not to perform such surgery. this includes cancer on the breast without cancer to achieve symmetry.
if a man has breast cancer at 60 does he get plastic surgery on the other side also?
so this question reflects on the language of the 1998 women's health rights act which mandates the private insurance companies cover the cost of breast reconstruction after mastectomy as well as symmetry procedures on the opposite breast. it doesn't cover males and it doesn't cover lumpectomy reconstruction. there are currently multiple pieces of legislation to help make up for these shortcomings.
if a man has breast cancer at 60 does he get plastic surgery on the other side also?
most do not opt for that or need it - that is mastopexy but they will cover it.
if a man has breast cancer at 60 does he get plastic surgery on the other side also?
regardless of sex or age anyone who is left with a cosmetic deformity after any cancer operation can be offered the option of reconstructive surgery. the few men that i have treated for breast cancer have not desired any reconstructive procedure for either the affected or unaffected side but this is an individual decision.
i have a pectus excavadum and my mammogram is always incomplete. what can they do for a thorough evaluation?
you could consider doing a bilateral breast mri if for some anatomical reason they are unable to perform a mamogram. it is more expenisve and dose appear to be a more sensitive test but has a higher rate of false positive. most insurers will deny this test for screening in patients who are not at a hightened risk of breast cancer but it may be worth a try.
if i had breast cancer mastectomy and implant on left side will mammograms be able to pick up new tumor in leftover tissue?
mastectomies by definition involve removal of (almost) all of the breat tissue present. while it is true that microscopic amounts of breast tissue can be left behind this is not amenable to mammographic evaluation regardless of whether a reconstruction was done. careful physical examination remains the best way to screen for local cancer recurrence following a mastectomy.
if i had breast cancer mastectomy and implant on left side will mammograms be able to pick up new tumor in leftover tissue?
mammography would be useful. if questions arise mri would be best but ultrasound would be useful.
if i had breast cancer mastectomy and implant on left side will mammograms be able to pick up new tumor in leftover tissue?
i agree with both of the answers posted. i would say that it is difficult because each breast is different and the fat plan decreases as you get closer to the nipple are polar complex. if any event a mammogram is not needed after mastectomy and implant recon but can be used to evaluate the remaining tissue. physical exam by the doctor is very important help guide any studies needed.
i never met a man with breast cancer. are they ashamed to tell?
breast cancer in men is about 1% of the rate in women and you may not have met a man who suffered from the disease.
i never met a man with breast cancer. are they ashamed to tell?
breast cancer is much less common in men so you may not have met anyone close enough. many may feel a stigma for having a "woman's disease" as men are not thought of as having breasts (they are undeveloped but present). some though are vocal in spreading awareness.
i never met a man with breast cancer. are they ashamed to tell?
1 in 100 breast cancers diagnosed are in men. maybe you just haven't met one yet.
is breast augmentation ever covered by insurance? are there any circumstances in which insurance would pay for breast augmentation? .
breast augmentation can be covered in some situations where there is significant asymmetry in breast volume or shape due to breast underdevelopment unilaterally some syndromes with underdeveloped chest muscle and breast etc. . obviously they are covered in women following breast cancer.
is breast augmentation ever covered by insurance? are there any circumstances in which insurance would pay for breast augmentation? .
breast augmentation is almost always considered a cosmetic procedure meaning that it is done to improve appearance and not to treat a medical condition. circumstances where breast implants might be covered by insurance are those in which the procedure is considered reconstructive such as following removal of breast tissue for breast cancer or to treat abnormal breast development (total absence of one breast or abnormal constriction of the breast skin and tissue). all the best dr. skourtis.
if i had breast cancer can i take estrogen in menopause?
you should speak with your oncologist however estrogens are usually not recommended if you have had breast cancer.
if i had breast cancer can i take estrogen in menopause?
if your breast cancer responded to estrogen you have a higher risk of problems. you should talk to your oncologist about the risks of taking estrogen.
i was diaganosed with invasive in situ breast cancer. what is the in situ about?
it is not uncommon to have in situ cancer next to invasive breast cancer. we stage the cancer based upon the size of the invasive component. however the extent of in situ disease may impact our ability to do a lumpectomy vs. mastectomy and may influence the type of radiation therapy that can be offered. i suggest you meet with your surgeon to review these details.
i was diaganosed with invasive in situ breast cancer. what is the in situ about?
' in situ' means with in the confinement ' ductal carcinoma in situ' means the cancer cell are confined to inside of ducts cells are dormant ( sleepy ) not spreading confined to within basement membrane of the duct. if one area cells penetrate the membrane of the duct and seen out side the duct means invasive will be ready to spread still a very early stage. same for lobular carcinom.
i was diaganosed with invasive in situ breast cancer. what is the in situ about?
carcinoma in situ means pre-cancer condition- non invasive lesions that contains in the ducts or lobules of the breast. on the other hand cancer is invasive neoplastic lesion of the breast. i am not clear to what you wrote- invasive in situ breast cancer?
i was diaganosed with invasive in situ breast cancer. what is the in situ about?
you are describing two different things. an in situ breast cancer means it is non-invasive. there can be ductal and lobular types of in situ (non-invasive) breast cancer. an invasive breast caner is something different meaning there is microscopic spread into the local breast tissue. in situ and invasive breast cancers may be treated differently. review with your doctor.
if a patient has breast cancer and breastfeeds her child do the stray cancer cells in the milk have any effect on her child?
studies cancer cell will not pass into milk and will not give cancer to the child even in later part of life. however doctors will not recommend breast feeding the medication radio isotopes will pass into milk and effect the child.
if a patient has breast cancer and breastfeeds her child do the stray cancer cells in the milk have any effect on her child?
the stray cancer cells in breast milk of a woman with breast cancer are not likely to be viable. even if viable such cells are likely to get digested in the stomach. however it is probably not a good idea to feed a baby on the breast that is known to have cancer as cancer tissues often release products that are not healthful and may be harmful.
is there any interaction between tamoxin and graviola?
graviola has not been studied in humans so what happens when taken with tamoxifen is not known. there is evidence from mouse experiments that it may help with breast cancer by downregulating epidermal growth factor however very little is known about it's effect in humans. there is some concern that it may cause a parkinson's like syndrome. i'd stay away from this until more is know about it.
is having a prophylactic mastectomy a good idea? what are all the ramifications?
only if you have a very high risk of breast cancer should you consider this operation. having the breast cancer gene is a frequent indication. the ramifications well how do you view life without breasts? there aren't really any physiologic problems afterwards and you can either wear prosthetics or have reconstruction but it is definitely not the same. big decision. get lots of advice.
is it a good idea to obtain a genetic test using 23andme? it would be good to know what major diseases such as breast cancer i am vulnerable to.
a person should not undertake such testing without thinking about the impact now and in the future. i refer patients considering obtaining special testing or their genome to a genetic counselor or medical geneticist. either can determine optimal testing for most patients and discuss details of what where when and how much to do. nb: through rock health there's a connection between our founders.
is it a good idea to obtain a genetic test using 23andme? it would be good to know what major diseases such as breast cancer i am vulnerable to.
your question is a very important one. a person should not undertake such testing without thinking about the impact on family members also. i highly recommend that my patients considering obtaining special testing or their genome speak with a genetic counselor or medical geneticist. we have some prominent physicians on healthtap who have board certification in genetics. i will refer this to them.
is it a good idea to obtain a genetic test using 23andme? it would be good to know what major diseases such as breast cancer i am vulnerable to.
this is a company that seems to have been created for this purpose. having said that i don't think they have the experience of interpretation that medical services like karyotyping in cytogenetics provide. these are done only when warranted by sickness. it is also important to know that genetic discrimination can occur from this which might lead to problems. more planning may be needed.
is it a good idea to obtain a genetic test using 23andme? it would be good to know what major diseases such as breast cancer i am vulnerable to.
i believe genetic testing will be an extremely important and standard tool in the future. there is evidence that tests like this can tell whether you are more or less susceptible to many diseases. that said genetics alone do not determine health risks; diet and lifestyle often play a larger role; fortunately 23andme acknowledges this & discusses what is known about this. please see my comment:.
in what conditions mustn't i use hormone supplements? breast cancer?
hormone replacement therapy (hrt) which generally refers to estrogen and progesterone replacement after a women has reached menopause has been shown to increase the risk of breast cancer if taken in combination for more than 5 years. if you are already diagnosed with a hormone positive breast cancer we do recommend discontinuing hrt.
if you get on birth control pills before you have a child does that raise your chance of getting breast cancer?
no.
if you get on birth control pills before you have a child does that raise your chance of getting breast cancer?
oral contraceptives have little or no effect on breast cancer risk.
i am taking homeopathic medicine for the lump in my right breast. i haven't taken any sort of exam for breast cancer. is it safe?
i suggest that the tooth be re-evaluated to see if there is damage to the nerve. if so a root canal will be needed. if not a permanent crown may be required to repair the tooth despite the age of the patient.
i am taking homeopathic medicine for the lump in my right breast. i haven't taken any sort of exam for breast cancer. is it safe?
how long ago did he chip the tooth? a day? a week? a month? was the chip bonded? is that what keeps coming off? it may be difficult for your dentist to restore that tooth depending on his bite and the extent of the fracture but he should not be in pain for more than a few days after the trauma. if he is in pain for longer than that have your dentist determine why the tooth still hurts. it is possible that the nerve has somehow been affected.
i am taking homeopathic medicine for the lump in my right breast. i haven't taken any sort of exam for breast cancer. is it safe?
it is better to wait to restore a tooth until the patient is a little older. 8 year old boy has a lot of growing to do. in the meantime you may have to continue bonding the teeth until he is almost full grown and then you can either crown or veneer the tooth. not much else to suggest. the 8 year old needs to be careful with the area for the time being.
i am taking homeopathic medicine for the lump in my right breast. i haven't taken any sort of exam for breast cancer. is it safe?
the longer we can wait to do anything with the tooth the better in many ways. perhaps the most significant is the experience of the child as negative experiences at a young age can have a long lasting effect. gumline pain on a tooth that is chipped is normally due to trauma. the bone around the tooth has been "bruised" and needs time to heal. to help make sure it can heal the bite gets adjusted to make sure the tooth isn't getting bit on very much. if the pain continues or becomes excruciating then something more should be done but the odds are that all will be fine.
is ductal carcinoma in situ really breast cancer? can lifestyle nutrition or supplements affect its course or occurrence?
carcinoma in-situ is just one step short of cancer. there is no scientific evidence for or against life style changes altering the course of in-situ lesions. you may engage in life style changes that promote a healthy life style but should not omit conventional treatment. steve jobs low grade cancer became fatal while he tried to treat it by alternative methods. see your doctor.
is ductal carcinoma in situ really breast cancer? can lifestyle nutrition or supplements affect its course or occurrence?
we dont consider dcis as an invasive breast cancer- rather we consider this as a precancer condition. / a non-invasive breast cancer- localized only on the duct or stage t0. you are right -there are a lot of factors that perhaps can contribute to development of cancer- like lifestyle/habits ( smoking/alcohol lack of exercise) nutrition/diet ( certain food/amino acids that is carcinogenic) etc.
is ductal carcinoma in situ really breast cancer? can lifestyle nutrition or supplements affect its course or occurrence?
in addition to all of the other answers there are some new ideas about this problem. the danger with this disease is that you are more likely to get invasive cancers. there is a recently developed test that can give a much better idea of who will get invasive cancer and who benefits from radiation.
is ductal carcinoma in situ really breast cancer? can lifestyle nutrition or supplements affect its course or occurrence?
ductal carcinoma in situ is basically a cancer which has not yet become invasive. the only way to treat this is to get rid of it before it turns into an invasive cancer. because it is detected early surgery provides a high rate of cure.
is ductal carcinoma in situ really breast cancer? can lifestyle nutrition or supplements affect its course or occurrence?
ductal carcinoma in situ means that the cancer is there in the duct but it has not invaded into the surrounding tissues of the breast. this means it was found early. can living a healthy lifestyle help? yes it can but it cannot fix it. get this removed before it becomes a more progressive invasive cancer.
i was diagnosed with invasive carcinoma breast cancer stage 2/ what's prognosis?
this stage has at least 65% 5 year survival for stage iib which is where the tumor is >5cm and has metastasis to movable ipsilateral lymph nodes. in stage iia the tumor is <= 5 cm with up to the same lymph node situation and has an 82% 5 year survival.
is having your 1st baby when you are young give you prevention against breast cancer?
studies have shown that women who have children at an early age have lower breast cancer risks. for example women who have their first child by age 20 have half the risk of estrogen-sensitive breast ca as a woman who had her first child after age 30. this risk may be further decreased by breastfeeding. while we don't know the mechanism we assume it has to do with less estrogen exposure.
is having your 1st baby when you are young give you prevention against breast cancer?
having a baby and breast feeding provide some protection against breast cancer. however this should not be a reason to have a baby.
is having your 1st baby when you are young give you prevention against breast cancer?
epidemiologic data suggests yes but in most societies having children in the late teens/early 20s is not the norm.
if the breast tumor is shrinking with chemotherapy is there a chance not needing surgery?
chemo given after the biopsy and before surgery has been found to help shrink some women's breast cancers. it will often allow the surgeon to take less tissue at the time of surgery. it is not a replacement for surgery. even if there appears by exam to be nothing left pathologically there will be a tremendous number of cancer cells left. have faith in your doctors. if you don't find ones you can!
if malignant breast tumor how fast does it grow?
tumors are different for everyone. some grow fast and some grow slow. age genetic factors and ethnicity can contribute. if you are diagnosed with breast cancer it is important to take time to explore and understand the treatments and options. in general it can take 2-4 weeks from the time of diagnosis until the first treatment intervention. be sure you get your questions answered by your dr.
if malignant breast tumor how fast does it grow?
doubling time of breast cancers is 100 days so if you believe cancer starts as one cell ie. maybe a stem cell transformation and that cell divides to begin cancer growth then::::one cell to 2 cells 2 to 4 4 to 8 8 to 16cells etc it takes 6 years to get to a 1 cm size that is 3/8 of a inch. and that is the threshold of what i can feel mammogram may show it earlier.
is it better to be her 2 positive or her2 negative?
breast cancer is broken into 4 types - each involves the presence or absence of estrogen progesterone and her 2 receptors: luminal a (er/pr positive her 2 negative) luminal b (er/pr positive her 2 positive) her 2 (er/pr negative her 2 positive) triple-negative (er/pr negative her 2 negative). patients who are her 2 positive herceptin (trastuzumab) a powerful drug that greatly improves survival.
is it better to be her 2 positive or her2 negative?
her2 positive breast cancer used to be the worst type and now it is probably the best type. that's because there are several excellent targeted therapies to effectively treat her2 positive cancer if it comes back. my patients with metastatic breast cancer who are her2 positive have the longest lifespans. and i'm happy when their cancer is her2 positive.
is it better to be her 2 positive or her2 negative?
her2 (+) cancers tend to be more aggressive. although targeted therapy w herceptin (trastuzumab) given along w chemotherapy then on its own for one year has improved survival it is still a more aggressive sub-type of breast cancer.
i get pain in my underarm/ upper breast area. any idea of whether it could be breast tumor?
pain under your arm and in your upper breast is probably not a breast cancer. pain in the breast is very common. if it comes and goes with your periods i'm reassured. if it is constant or worsening you should see a doctor. there is a rare type of breast cancer called inflammatory breast cancer that causes severe pain redness swelling and skin dimpling but your symptoms sound more mild.
i had scc on face bowens on leg & now diagnosis breast cancer (focal scc also) is there a link having skin cancer & breast cancer?
no correlation between squamous cell cancer of the skin with breast cancer. scc of the skin- including bowen's disease which is squamous carcinoma in situ of the skin- are related to uv exposures. breast cancer with a focal scc- is suspicious for metaplastic carcinoma of the breast- a very rare type of breast cancer. there is a relation between metaplastic cancer with brca 1 mutation.
i had scc on face bowens on leg & now diagnosis breast cancer (focal scc also) is there a link having skin cancer & breast cancer?
not usually linked specifically but if you have genetic abnormality that predisposes you to cancer it could show up this way. your age and family history are important. brca testing may be appropriate. (www myriad. com).
i had scc on face bowens on leg & now diagnosis breast cancer (focal scc also) is there a link having skin cancer & breast cancer?
there is no clear link that we know of today. however in the future we discover the link.
is axiliary breast tissue a symptom for breast cancer?
some women have breast tissue under their arms that enlarges when they become pregnant or occasionally during the menstrual cycle. cancer is unusual but not unheard of. if a lump persists have it checked.
is axiliary breast tissue a symptom for breast cancer?
normal breast has an extension into the axilla axillary tail. while cancer can develop in the axillary tail as it can elsewhere the axillary tail is not a symptom of cancer.
is docetaxel-120 inj. available in india for chemotherapy (breast cancer) patients?
docetaxel is widely available in india.
is docetaxel-120 inj. available in india for chemotherapy (breast cancer) patients?
i think docetaxel should be available in india. however for sure check with your local hospital/ oncologist in india.
is it possible to get breast cancer metastases after 15 yrs?
time to recurrence curves have two peaks - one at 3-5 years and a second longer tail. er- tumors if they recur are almost all in the first peak. er+ tumors can recur more distantly in the future. after 10 years (or sooner if er-) one must asses if it is a recurrence of the original tumor or a new second primary.
is it possible to get breast cancer metastases after 15 yrs?
not common but i have seen one patient with a metastasis 25 years after surgery!
is radiation therapy necessary when i have early stage of breast cancer with all clear margins?
there is nothing that makes a surgeon more uncomfortable after a lumpectomy than hearing the question: "did you get it all? " cancer is very humbling and it's growth is not completely predictable. while our margins may be "clear" we know many women will return with cancer at this lumpectomy site within 2-3 years unless radiation therapy is given. with rare exception radiation rx is necessary.
is radiation therapy necessary when i have early stage of breast cancer with all clear margins?
i do agree with dr. ho with the exception of triple negative breast cancertnbc is neg for estrogen progesterone her2 receptors because of this there is not a direct chemo treatment. also this type of breast ca -about 15% of breast cancers-is usually not very sensitive to radiation therapy it is quite responsive to chemotherapy (non-hormonal). if you are "autoimmune" rads may not work well.
is radiation therapy necessary when i have early stage of breast cancer with all clear margins?
for early stage of breast cancer-when a breast sparing surgery-i. e. lumpectomy is able to be done with clear margins- postsurgical radiation therapy is recommended to reduce risk for local recurrence to the affected breast. so the asnwer is yes it is necessary.
if a metastatic breast cancer sufferer has severe ascites how long can they live like that?
your situation sounds serious. if the cause of ascites is also cancer you are likely at stage 4. your longevity will be affected by your decisions to continue treatment and at what level. your quality of live and your relationships remain of primary importance.
if a metastatic breast cancer sufferer has severe ascites how long can they live like that?
this is usually a poor prognostic sign and survival is short. but a few people respond to treatment and live a little longer.
i got surgically treated 4 br abscess. i am non lactating. what are my chances of having breast cancer in future.?
simple breast abscess does not usually associated with breast cancer. however some breast cancer can get infected and cause abscess. any concern should address with ur surgeon.
i got surgically treated 4 br abscess. i am non lactating. what are my chances of having breast cancer in future.?
having an abscess will not increase your risks of having breast cancer. you still have about one chance in 9 of getting breast cancer. things like family history and history of previous breast lesions may increase your risk.
i got surgically treated 4 br abscess. i am non lactating. what are my chances of having breast cancer in future.?
breast abscess has no significant impact on your risk of breast cancer. for all practical intents and purposes your risk of breast cancer is the same as it was before the diagnosis of your breast abscess. only if the breast abscess became chronic would it significantly impact your risk of breast cancer by a small amount.
is it normal to have nipple discharge?
reasons for nipple discharge can include stimulation of the breast pregnancy medications galactorrhea (secretion of milk or similar substance) an abscess or other breast infection hormonal imbalances (like hypothyroidism) fibrocystic breasts (breasts are very fibrous) blocked mammary duct breast cancer and intraductal papilloma (non cancerous mass) use of marijuana anise and fennel.
is it better to be her 2 positive or negative for breast cancer?
i think it's best to play with the cards that you are dealt: if one is her2(-) this usually reflects a less aggressive cancer (although this is only one piece of the puzzle); if one is her2(+) there is a very effective chemotherapeutic agent that can only be used in this setting herceptin (trastuzumab). either way we have many very effective options for breast cancer rx and the odds are in our favor.
is it better to be her 2 positive or negative for breast cancer?
is growth factor carrying adverse prognosis but also affords a treatment option herceptin (trastuzumab) the her-2-neu + patients get. triple negative is worse in prognosis than er/pr- but her-2-neu positive. being erudite about prognosis does not eliver psycho/emotional comfort. you can survive with poor prognostic signs and you can proress and die despite all positive factors. seek peace/accept.
is pain in a breast tumor a cancer symptom?
pain associate with breast cancer is a late sign. however there are more patient with breast pain that is not associate with breast cancer. please check with your doctor.
if the breast tumor is shrinking with chemotherapy is there a need for surgery?
congratulations for responding to chemotherapy! this will make it easier for your surgeon to get clear margins. it is important to get the entire tumor removed. if not once the chemo is stopped the tumor may grow back and become more aggressive (i. e. spread to other parts of body). for the best outcome (i. e. avoid death) please adhere to the treatment by your breast cancer team.
if you have a family history of breast cancer can you still avoid it?
1st-a family history does not mean its a predetermined fact for you but influences risk. options include 1)increased screening incl. bmri 2)chemo prevention such as tamoxifen/raloxifene which reduce the risk of er+ tumors by 40-50% 3)prophylactic ic surgery which is usually reserved for known brcamutation carriers where the lifetime risk may approach 70-90%.
if you have a family history of breast cancer can you still avoid it?
pedigree you will see that all the women (and men) in previous generations did not develop breast cancer so your genes *may* carry risk but do not determine your fate. if you are tested for brca 1/2 and are positive your risk is quite high that you will devlope breast and or ovarian cancer but this is where genetic esting and counseling can delier answers and peace of mind. go!
is combined tamoxifen plus hormonal therapy better for breast cancer in pre or postmenopausal women?
in general aromatase inhibitor is only indicated for postmenopausal women ;not for premenopausal; while on the other hand tamoxifen can be given either in pre or postmenopausal. only thing is that tamoxifen can cause a little bit higher risk for complication -i. e. risk for blood clots and risk for develping uterine cancer- when used in older population- age of -65 y. o. or above.
is combined tamoxifen plus hormonal therapy better for breast cancer in pre or postmenopausal women?
in general tamoxifen is used for premenopausal women and aromatase inhibitors are used for postmenopausal women.
is combined tamoxifen plus hormonal therapy better for breast cancer in pre or postmenopausal women?
er/pr receptor status on resected tumor as if these are negative no role for hormone therapy. post orpre-menopausal er+ patients are treated with the effective cheap low adverse effect tamoxifen a useful drug for more than 30 years. but ovarain function precluses use of anastrazome or the newer more expensive letrozole. these all work; toxiicty and cost vary.
is breast reconstruction done the same way as a cosmetic job?
breast reconstruction surgery is a common surgical practice to help restore and recreate a woman's breasts following a mastectomy for breast cancer. surgical techniques may use implants or a patient's own tissue to recreate the breast. also most women don't realize that breast reconstruction is covered by health insurance rather than being a cosmetic operation you would have to pay for.
is breast reconstruction done the same way as a cosmetic job?
breast cancer and reconstruction from cancer are much different procedures compared to breast augmentation for instance. reconstruction is necessary when the majority if tissue is removed after mastectomy. this is covered by insurance thanks to the 1998 women's health right act. implant based reconstruction is the closest to augmentation but it is far more difficult to to mimic the shape of breast.
i'm er+ pr- and her2+ but been told i have triple negative breast cancer. what is that?
triple negative breast cancer refers to breast cancers that have tested negative for estrogen receptor protein (er) progesterone receptor protein (pr) and her-2/neu. they tend to be more aggressive tumors. from your description your tumor is positive for er and her2 which opens up several treatment options that "triple negative" patients don't have. clarify your status with your oncologist.
if a woman has larger breasts does that increase her chance for breast cancer? what about a taller larger woman?
breast size does not increase the risk for breast cancer. it is important to become familiar with your breasts by performing breast self exams every month. get to know your normal lumpiness so an abnormality can be detected. you may have to push a little harder to feel the deep tissues. being overweight does put one at increased risk but not height.
if a woman has larger breasts does that increase her chance for breast cancer? what about a taller larger woman?
large breasts will not increase the chance of developing breast cancer. it may make it harder for a woman to feel a lump if she should have one. it would be a good idea to have regular breast exams and screening mammography as is appropriate for every woman. tall larger women won't increase breast cancer either.
is there an effective substitue for tamoxifen as post cancer treatment?
is used for patients with er+/pr+ breast cancer. it can be used pre- or post menopausal patients. aromatase inhibitors (anastrazole. letrozole) can only be used in post-menopausal patients or those that have had oopherectomy or leuprolide to stop ovarian production of estrogens.
i'worried as my sister got breast cancer. is there a bad risk of breast cancer for me just because she got it?
you could be at higher risk for developing breast cancer but there are many questions that need to be answered: how old is your sister? are there other family members affected? is there ovarian cancer in your family? how old are you? age at first period? how many pregnancies and at what age of first full term delivery? to name a few. i recommend you seek out a breast surgeon or genetic counselor.
i'worried as my sister got breast cancer. is there a bad risk of breast cancer for me just because she got it?
your sister can have the genetic testing to evaluate the risk for the family. according to this you can get tested. most cancers however are not genetic but related to other controllable factors such as keeping a healthy weight being plant based less fat less alcohol (less than 7 per week) exercising vitamin d levels smoking and balancing any hormonal problems.
if paget's breast cancer spreads to the bones then does that person have paget's bone disease?
paget's disease of the breast is a particular type of breast cancer that starts under the nipple. most are very treatable but like any other breast cancer - advanced cases may metastasize. paget's disease of the bone is a chronic problem that is not realted to cancer.
if paget's breast cancer spreads to the bones then does that person have paget's bone disease?
despite similarity in names paget disease of the bone is very different from metastatic breast cancer. paget disease of the bone is generally localized bone malformation though is may cause bony deformity fracture pain and in rare cases lead to bone cancer.
if a woman gets breastcancer and had to have her breast removed would breast implants look natural enough?
after mastectomy for breast cancer breast reconstruction with implants is the most common type of approach. typically a tissue expander is placed first to stretch the chest wall tissue to accomodate an implant later although less commonly it can be placed right away. although a very satisfactory option the breasts may not appear "natural". other options involve using body tissue.
is it possible to get a referral from your doctor to get a breast enlargment/lift after childbirth?
but that is not the same as getting your insurance to pay for the procedure. breast enlargement in the us is always considered a cosmetic procedure not covered by insurance. breast lift will only be covered if it is being used to try and make a normal saggy breast match a reconstructed breast most comonly seen after treatment for breast cancer.
is it possible to get breast cancer from something hitting your boobs?
what usually happens is that one would pay more attentions to the breast and examine it frequently due to the trauma ( got hit by something) and she then accidentally finds a lump or mass on the breast. the lump most likely has been there for a while and not related to the trauma.
is it possible to get breast cancer from something hitting your boobs?
no an isolated breast trauma has not been linked to breast cancer but if you have concerns about a bruised area or a lump it is best to have it looked at by your pcp or our breast surgeon. they will likely order an ultrasound and mammogram to get baseline information and ruling out tumors.
is it possible to get breast cancer from something hitting your boobs?
"wives' tale" completely unfounded. there is the possibiliy that n established cancer when traumatized could bleed and enlarge but "cause" is stuff of stories.
is breast enhancement cream or tablet safe?
any pill or cream that stimulates breast growth has the risk of stimulating breast cancer.
is it possible for a 23yo woman that does not have any family history of breast cancer get it?
not common but can occur. i have personally treated about 1500 women with breast cancer. the youngest was only 21 and at least 6 or 7 were less than 30.
is it possible for a 23yo woman that does not have any family history of breast cancer get it?

is there such thing as natural breast enhancement?
there are many products that make these claims. however the safety and effectiveness is not fully understood. concerns with stimulating breast cancer when stimulating breast growth are one of the issues raised with these products.
is there anyone offering to give free breast cancer exams as a regular program anywhere in the u. s.?
contact your local american cancer society office. they ususally support free screening mammograms at health fares and other opportunities. additionally your local health department may advise you on free screening locations.
is there anyone offering to give free breast cancer exams as a regular program anywhere in the u. s.?
there are some federally supported programs sponsored in different states. here in nevada there is a free annual screening program for uninsured women over age 40 to have free breast and cervical cancer screening. but it does not include treatment if a condition is identified.
is there anyone offering to give free breast cancer exams as a regular program anywhere in the u. s.?
florida also has free exams at times.
is zometa used to prevent bone-loss in postmenopausal women with breast cancer?
it is usually used to control/treat bony metastases in breast cancer but it also decreases bone loss.
is zometa used to prevent bone-loss in postmenopausal women with breast cancer?
it is approved for aromatase induced bone loss. there has also been data but in my opinion still inconclusive on preventing recurrence but some data suggest it may.

yes that is the goal of this therapy.
is 21 years old too young for my daughter to get screened for breast cancer?
mammography screening does not begin until age 40 unless you were diagnosed with breast cancer at a young age (before 35). at 21 the breasts are too dense to show anything on mammogram. if she has a abnormal lump then she should see her doctor for evaluation. in some cases an ultrasound can be used.
is 21 years old too young for my daughter to get screened for breast cancer?
21 years old is too early for a screening mammogram. however it is a good idea to do monthly self examinations and yearly clinical breast exams. in special circumstances such as strong family history or positive brca test screening mammogram starts sooner than the usual 35-40 years of age. in these circumstances make sure to discuss the issue with your physician.
is breast enhancement cream and tablets safe?
any herbal supplements possesing estrogen like properties have the potential to promote breast growth. for example marijuana is known to stimulate the growth of breasts in men. similarly. excessive intake of certain soy products may also simulate estrogen like side effects. in addition to those mentioned. however the potential for stimulating breast cancer growth and other side effects is unknown.
is there any proof that radiation from mammograms can cause breast cancer? is there any legitimate alternative to screen for breast cancer?
the radiation exposure of a digital mammogram is 3. 7mgy. this is associated with a lifetime-attributable risk of breast cancer of 1. 3 cases per 100 000. mammography is a safe proven technique for finding cancers well before they are palpable and there is no controversy about its use after age 50. thermograms are 25% as sensitive as mammograms and not suitable for screening.
is there any proof that radiation from mammograms can cause breast cancer? is there any legitimate alternative to screen for breast cancer?
there is some other technologies like breast mri and ultrasound but the gold standard test is mammography.
is there any proof that radiation from mammograms can cause breast cancer? is there any legitimate alternative to screen for breast cancer?
there was a trial done in high risk women at the national cancer institute. it took young women and randomized them to yearly mammograms starting at age 30 or one at 30 35 and then yearly at 40. those that had yearly mammograms starting at 30 had a higher risk. now this was prior to digital mammograms (which have less radiation). hence the risk is very small and benefits outweigh the risks.
is there any proof that radiation from mammograms can cause breast cancer? is there any legitimate alternative to screen for breast cancer?
there is no doubt that mammograms can cause breast cancer but we are not sure how often; conservative estimates say about 1 in 1000 will get cancer from mammograms while others say they can increase risk up to 20% & nobel prize winner john gofman believes up to half of cancers are caused by x-rays! thermography is one alternative. see my comment for links & further discussion of a complex issue.
is there any proof that radiation from mammograms can cause breast cancer? is there any legitimate alternative to screen for breast cancer?
there is still no definite proof that mammograms cause breast cancer. the concern for increasing cancers is based on projections from data originally obtained from the atomic bomb results in japan in 1945. but everyone should be cautious and conservative when it comes to possibly causing cancer. the alternatives for mammograms include mri and ultrasound. discuss options with your doctor.
is there any proof that radiation from mammograms can cause breast cancer? is there any legitimate alternative to screen for breast cancer?
there's still disagreement about the value of mamography in the scientific community but it centers on the cost and problems of false-positives rather than causing cancer. back when i was in med school i was the only person who took a few minutes with each women to discuss and teach breast self-exam. i'm skeptical about the more recent studies that question its value since it's often done poorly.
is there any proof that radiation from mammograms can cause breast cancer? is there any legitimate alternative to screen for breast cancer?
proof that mammograms cause cancer. risk calculations are based on data extrapolated from radiation induced cancers from much higher doses. see xrayrisk. com for risk calculations. currently mammography is the standard of care for screening: the consensus is that the benefits far outweigh the minimal theoretical risks. the alternatives such as ultrasound and mri have their own drawbacks.
is it true that breast implants increase your chances of breast cancer?
breast implants do not affect the rate of breast cancer according to the most recent plastic surgery research. there is a slightly increased risk of alcl in women with silicone implants.
is it true that breast implants increase your chances of breast cancer?
there is no evidence to date that breast implants increase the risk of breast cancer.
is it true that breast implants increase your chances of breast cancer?
this question has been studied extensively. there is actually a suggestion that the presence of implants may allow earlier detection of breast cancer by self exam because the implants push the breast tissue out against the examiner's fingers. i am not aware of any evidence that implants increase the risk of breast cancer.
is it true that breast implants increase your chances of breast cancer?
statistically women with breast implants have a lower incidence of breast cancer. this is thought to be more related to the fact that these women have less breast tissue rather than something as a result of the implant itself.
is it true that breast implants increase your chances of breast cancer?
breast implants do not increase your risk of cancer <link> drschulmanplasticsurgery. com/breast/breast-augmentation/.
is it true that breast implants increase your chances of breast cancer?
you still need to do self breast examination and annual mammograms (after age 40) but there is no link between implants and breast cancer.
is it true that breast implants increase your chances of breast cancer?
when large groups of women with breast implants are compared with large groups of women without breast implants there is no difference in the number size or types of breast cancer seen. when evaluating these studies it is important to be certain the groups are matched for age and other known risk factors. breast implants are used to reconstruct breasts after breast cancer.
is it possible for a 16 year old get breast cancer?
incredibly unlikely. if you have any concerns please get your 16 year old checked by her doc. good luck.
if my mom had breast cancer does that mean i will have breast cancer?
but your risk is increased especially if she had it when she was young had it in both breasts or if you have a family history of ovarian colon or uterine cancer. you might see a specialist who counsels women at higher risk - typically a breast surgeon genetic counselor or medical oncologist.
if my mom had breast cancer does that mean i will have breast cancer?
your mom's cancer is very important for your risk assessment. but jut because she had it does not mean you do. you need to be checked and taught to perform self breast exams and talk to your obgyn about when to start screening mammograms. good luck.
is paget's disease cancerous in all cases?
paget's dz represents less than 5% of all breast cancers; cancer cells are found involving the skin of the nipple resembling eczema. over 95% of the time an underlying cancer is found elsewhere in the breast more commonly in-situ rather than invasive. traditional rx was mastectomy however central lumpectomy (removal of nipple and areola) followed by radiation therapy is an acceptable alternative.
is there any difference between breast cancer and a milk allergy?
not related.

it would be rare but it is possible.
in what cases would a person get breast reconstruction surgery?
breast reconstruction is most commonly done after mastectomy or lumpectomy and radiation for breast cancer. breast reconstruction may also be required after trauma burns severe infection and congenital disorders such as poland's syndrome.
in what cases would a person get breast reconstruction surgery?
breast reconstruction is the rebuilding of a breast usually after surgery for breast cancer (mastectomy or lumpectomy) or surgery to prevent breast cancer ("prophylactic mastectomy"). non-cancer related reasons to need breast reconstruction include congenital breast absence (eg poland's syndrome) and to reconstruct after mastectomy performed for severe infection or tumors like phyllodes.
in what cases would a person get breast reconstruction surgery?
despite many advances in breast cancer rx some women still require mastectomy. reconstruction is an option for most women either immediately or delayed. some women opt for lesser forms of (onco)plastic surgery even after lumpectomies. while these operations are performed by plastic surgeons they are not 'cosmetic'--they are part of the cancer care and are covered by insurance.
is it possible to have breast cancer cells in lung cancer?
it means the origin of the tumor is from the breast. it is a primary breast cancer that has spread or metastasized to the lung.
is it possible to have breast cancer cells in lung cancer?
physicians do speak a "foreign tongue" at times. many patients ask me when the have spread of cancer to a bone if they have bone cancer. breast cancer cells in lung cancer are more likely breast cancer cells that have spread to the lung. there would be a cancerous mass in the lung and a biopsy would show breast cancer cells. this would be metastatic cancer to the lung. i think that is your issue.
is it possible to have breast cancer cells in lung cancer?
lung cancer - as in other organs where cancer is found include primary ( from within) and secondary ( as the result of cancer spread) cancers. breast cancer can spread to brain bone lung and liver.
if my right breast aches is that indicative of breast cancer?
very common and non-specific symptom. it can be associated with many conditions. see you doctor to be evaluated.
if my right breast aches is that indicative of breast cancer?
pain is not a usual symptom of cancer. most pain issues are benign and are easily treated. talk to your primary doc about this.
if my right breast aches is that indicative of breast cancer?
but get checked. pain is not a common presenting sign of breast ca.
if one has slow-growing metastatic breast cancer will the anti-cancer drugs make the cancer more aggressive?
does not alter biologic behavior. mets are never good. some argue to re-biopsy to recheck re-ceptors (er pr her-2-neu): the cells that metastasize may be different from those at outset. best gauge is time from dx to relapse for "slow". bony only and er+ usually fit this pattern. cytotoxic chemo does not change growth or met potential but cancers themselves can mutate to more aggressive type.
if one has slow-growing metastatic breast cancer will the anti-cancer drugs make the cancer more aggressive?
chemotherapy or anti-cancer medications are used to kill cancer cells. it is important to complete your prescribed regimen according to your medical oncologist.
if you remove the breast tissue and replace it with saline implants. will this take away the risk of getting breast cancer that is genetic?
mastectomy almost always leaves breast tissue behind and reduces but does not eliminate risk of cancer. i large expensive procedure for an incomplete guarantee unproven by evidence and not covered by insurance.
if you remove the breast tissue and replace it with saline implants. will this take away the risk of getting breast cancer that is genetic?
if you mean having your breasts removed entirely and having reconstruction with implants then yes - you eliminate the breast cancer risk if there is no more breast tissue. good luck.
im a her2 breast cancer patient stage 3. due to financial constraint i finished 12 sessions of herceptin instead of 17 is there any medicine i could take as a replacement of the herceptin? i'm from the philippines and herceptin is very expensive.
there is not a less expensive substitute. the manufacturer might have some support programs but i am not sure if it is available in your case. you still have gotten benefit from your treatment. check with your oncologist to see if a support through genentech is available.
im a her2 breast cancer patient stage 3. due to financial constraint i finished 12 sessions of herceptin instead of 17 is there any medicine i could take as a replacement of the herceptin? i'm from the philippines and herceptin is very expensive.
in the us the studies of herceptin (trastuzumab) looked at a full year of treatment for patients like you with curable breast cancer. herceptin (trastuzumab) is given every three weeks for 17 doses. but why a year? it was chosen at random. in finland a similar study gave only 9 weeks of herceptin (trastuzumab). and patients did just as well! so i think you should feel reassured that you've had plenty. no worries!
im a her2 breast cancer patient stage 3. due to financial constraint i finished 12 sessions of herceptin instead of 17 is there any medicine i could take as a replacement of the herceptin? i'm from the philippines and herceptin is very expensive.
i think you have had adequate amount of herceptin(a few missed doses are not a major concern). there are a couple of new drugs which are increasingly used with or without herceptin (trastuzumab) but they are expensive and just coming on the market. some of the alternative drugs are : lapatinib(pill) pertuzumab(perjeta) and tdm1(kadcyla).
i had a hysterectomy 5 years ago and my breast hurt very bad?

is it safe to wear a bra 24 hours a day? i heard it is a factor contributing to breast cancer is thst true?
there is no objective scientific evidence linking the use of bras to breast cancer.
is it safe to wear a bra 24 hours a day? i heard it is a factor contributing to breast cancer is thst true?
this claim was made up in the 1990's with no basis by a single anti-brassiere militant. ignore it.
is it safe to wear a bra 24 hours a day? i heard it is a factor contributing to breast cancer is thst true?
bras nor underwire do not contribute to breast cancer. i'm not aware of any harm of wearing a bra on a regular basis. the question is why do you need to? are you having pain/discomfort? do you have droopy breasts and it is more comfortable? are you lactating and it's more comfortable? the important thing is to get properly fitted by a bra specialist to be sure you are wearing the right bra
is there a possibilty of cancer metastases while herceptin (trastuzumab) session is still on going?
to start with her 2 positive breast cancers are very aggressive tumors due to over expression of her 2 gene ( makes her 2 protein causing uncontrollable growth ) herceptin (trastuzumab) a monoclonal antibody controls that growth it is possible tumor can spread simultaneously during course of treatment.
is there a possibilty of cancer metastases while herceptin (trastuzumab) session is still on going?
herceptin (trastuzumab) is used to treat breast cancers that have her2/neu receptors. while this drug is very effective it will not eradicate all breast cancer cells 100% of the time. therefore it is possible to be diagnosed with metastatic disease despite ongoing treatment (although we certainly hope not). of course every case is unique & the best dr. to talk to is the treating physician. good luck!
i need breast implants. should i insist on them for 19th bday?
breast implants are it a need even in the event of breast cancer. they are an elective surgical option that carries risks serious ones that should be fully understood. you need to know the potential complications and outcomes and alternatives. yu should insist that your surgeon discuss these with you. this is a lifelong undertaking and should not be decided on a whim as a birthday gift you can return.
i need breast implants. should i insist on them for 19th bday?
breast implants are never a need. they are a want and should go with a certain level of social and emotional maturity. they cost money. the surgery has risks you need to be well aware and accepting of and there are ongoing maintanence costs associated with having them. unless you have breast cancer insurance doesn't cover their placement or replacement.
is there a connection between alcohol use and breast cancer?
epidemiology generates all sorts of ever-changing correlations. the review in jama nov '11 reinforced what most of us think; if there's a relationship it's weak and i suspect it has more to do with some other correlating lifestyle factor or the drinker's low folate (folic acid) levels. the relationship is anything but obvious clinically.
is there a connection between alcohol use and breast cancer?
many studies have confirmed an association between alcohol intake & breast cancer though the degree of risk varies. in general a woman who drinks 3 mixed drinks a week has a 15% higher risk of breast ca as a non drinker; this risk may go up by ~10% for each extra drink a day. this increase is most pronounced for estrogen-sensitive tumors; it is believed that alcohol may boost estrogen levels.
is there a connection between alcohol use and breast cancer?
alcohol can compromise immune system but i am not aware of direct correlation with cancer except in women since it may increase estrogen levels.
is there a connection between alcohol use and breast cancer?
2 causes of breast cancer: ionizing radiation and estrogen/progesterone combo products.
is mastectomy really necessary for a cancer patient?
as much as possible most surgeons do not recommend complete mastectomy surgery for breast cancer unless there is no other surgical option. lumpectomy or partial mastectomy can be done for some patients. reasons for mastectomy may be large cancers ulcerating cancer inflammatory cancer multiple sites of cancers extensive dcis cancer already metastatic. ask your oncologist for opinion too.
im a her 2 stage 3 breast cancer patient my dr advice me to have zometa every 6 mos. is zometa can help prevent bone metastasize? is it helpful to avoid bone cancer?
zometa is uses to prevent osteoporosis and it is not a chemotherapeutic agent. its uses along with stranded chemotherapy 41 % time it prevents or delays skeletal related events ( sre ) and 17 % of risk of development of metastasis.
im a her 2 stage 3 breast cancer patient my dr advice me to have zometa every 6 mos. is zometa can help prevent bone metastasize? is it helpful to avoid bone cancer?
there is some suggestion that zometa may prevent development of bone metastases. but it is still not a standard of care because one study suggested a benefit which has not been confirmed in further studies. i will leave it up to the judgment of your oncologist and you
im a her2 stage 3 breast cancer parient. i have already finished my herceptin (trastuzumab) what would be the next medication would i take as maintenance medicine?
there are many medicines used to treat breast cancer. besides herceptin (trastuzumab) your doctor may prescribe chemotherapy or hormonal therpy depending on the subtype of breast cancer that you have. hormonal therpies are used for er+ cancers. so check if your tumor wass er+ or er-. ask you oncologist to address this question.
im a her2 stage 3 breast cancer parient. i have already finished my herceptin (trastuzumab) what would be the next medication would i take as maintenance medicine?
oncologists always keep up with current trends make sure you follow their advise advisable to take zometa it will help osteoporosis even menopausal woman will have this problem. zometa found to be helpful in preventing sre ( skeletal related events fracture muscle joint problems ) also prevent risk of bone metastasis in 17 %.
i had a full histerectomy ten years ago and now im suffering from severe pain in my breast is this cancer or what could it be?
the most common cause of breast pain after menopause is actually chest wall pain which feels as if it's coming from the breast. nevertheless breast cancer can cause breast pain. your safest bet is to make an appointment with your primary care doctor. they can order the appropriate tests or refer you to a breast specialist. good luck!
is mammogram or ultrasound best for early breast cancer detection?
mammograms are generally better at screening for breast cancer. ultrasound is used more for a focus evaluation of an area of the breast that might be suspicious or appear abnormal.
is mammogram or ultrasound best for early breast cancer detection?
mammo is the standard of care for screening. mammo is approximately 80% sensitive for detecting breast cancer and detects 3-5 cancers per 1000 patients. sensitivity decreases in women with dense breasts. ultrasound detects approximately 2-3 cancers per 1000 patients. ultrasound performs better in dense breasts mammo performs better in fatty breasts.
i get breast pain the 2 weeks before my period worse pain in the right one plus it itches sometimes. does that mean breast cancer?
painful & sometimes swollen or lumpy breasts worse around the menstrual cycle is most often a benign fibrocystic condition. however a firm breast lump that persists would be concerning. see a doctor for a breast examination.
i get breast pain the 2 weeks before my period worse pain in the right one plus it itches sometimes. does that mean breast cancer?
this is most likely physiologic. your breasts are responding to the hormones in your body. you should discuss your concerns with your friendly primary care physician.
i get breast pain the 2 weeks before my period worse pain in the right one plus it itches sometimes. does that mean breast cancer?
these are changes and symptoms that occur normally in reaction to hormonal changes. the breasts can also feel lumpier too. if you have lumps that do not feel normal to you then i recommend you get evaluated by your doctor.
i get breast pain the 2 weeks before my period worse pain in the right one plus it itches sometimes. does that mean breast cancer?
the menstrual period represents the effect of hormone activity and changes on the uterus. thus two weeks before period when estrogen secretion is highest and before progesterone appears the hormone has effects on many tissues including breast. at that point maximum secretion of fluid and dilatation of milk ducts occur to cause your symptoms. no ca involved.
i have and parenchymal disease is this the sign of breast cancer?
"parenchyma" is a generic term and does not necessarily refer to a specific disease entity or any specific associated risk. ask your physician for more information and clarification.
i have and parenchymal disease is this the sign of breast cancer?
the term "parenchymal disease" has meaning only in context. breast parenchymal diseases encompass a host of benign and malignant entities. we'll need to get tissue to decide.
i was diagnosed with breast cancer in 2000 i had radical bilateral mastectomy chemo and radiation i had metastasis to the rib in 2006 and 2010 recent biopsy of lymph nodes on the left upper chest near my clavicle and neck showed adenocarcinoma what treatm
your case is too complicated for a simple answer. you need to be in a cancer center where your treatment can be tailored to what your specific case requires. sorry i can't provide more info.
i was diagnosed with breast cancer in 2000 i had radical bilateral mastectomy chemo and radiation i had metastasis to the rib in 2006 and 2010 recent biopsy of lymph nodes on the left upper chest near my clavicle and neck showed adenocarcinoma what treatm
i agree with the other answer: need more information. you may need hormonal chemo and/or biologic treatment. many good chances to get better. good luck!
i have the result of ultra sound of my right breast. and it shows features of fibroadenosis of right breast and multiple small well defined isoechoeic masses-fibro adenomas. what is mean of this. is this the sign of breast cancer?
but why did you get it? the proper followup or continued workup requires understanding of the full situation to make sure. please discuss these results with the doctor who ordered the ultrasound.
is it common that breast cancer metastisize in the skin? what are signs of skin cancer?
most of the skin metastasis in local area of breast as set lite metastasis in advanced breast cancer out side breast skin metastasis is rare and unusual. primary skin cancers like melanoma from pig. mole or squamous cell or basal cell all have their own futures for any suspicious non healing lesion should seek help of a professionals for early detection and cure.
is it common that breast cancer metastisize in the skin? what are signs of skin cancer?
breast cancer spread to the skin is uncommon but there are two scenarios worth discussing. sometimes after breast cancer has been surgically removed it can regrow near the incision. the second situation is called inflammatory breast cancer. here the skin is involved with cancer by direct extension of the breast cancer.
is it common that breast cancer metastisize in the skin? what are signs of skin cancer?
while no common it does happen.
i have the result of my right breast ultra sound and it shows. features of fibroadenosis of right breast and multiple small well defined isoechoeic masses-fibro adenomas. what its mean; is this the sign of breast cancer? pls i need your concerned.
your doctor will surly want to get blopsies or remove the fibroadenomas but they are not cancerous. it is a little unusual to have several and i'd ask your doctor why.
i have a light white spot on my arms and legs and its a little bit itchy. im a breast cancer patient and presently taking up herceptin (trastuzumab). is this an allergy pr fungal?
rashes are hard to describe in words so a primary care doctor or a dermatologist can look at it and evaluate. a light colored spot that is a bit itchy could be just eczema (a dry spot of sensitive skin that gets a bit itchy a bit flaky a bit crackly etc. ). it could be fungal such as tinea versicolor (but that usually is a bunch of spots). other rashes are possible so an exam will help.
is herceptin (trastuzumab) still effective if i stop for 2 mos then continue it because of unavoidable circumstances?
in the us the studies of herceptin (trastuzumab) looked at a full year of treatment for patients with curable breast cancer. herceptin (trastuzumab) is given every three weeks for 17 doses. but why a year? it was chosen at random. in finland a similar study gave only 9 weeks of herceptin (trastuzumab). and patients did just as well! so i think you should feel reassured that you will still have a positive effect from the drug!
if breasts are removed due to breast cancer can a woman get new breasts via an implant?
yes. typically a bag will be put in under the muscle at the time of the breast removal (mastectomy) and then salt water put into the breast every week until you get to the size you want. then the bag (expander) is taken out and a saline or silicone implant is put in.
if breasts are removed due to breast cancer can a woman get new breasts via an implant?
yes they can. there are also other techniques where tissue from different parts of the body are used to reconstruct the breasts.
if breasts are removed due to breast cancer can a woman get new breasts via an implant?
implant reconstruction is commonly done for breast cancer. it is sometimes done at the time of mastectomy. not sure what you mean by new breasts. once removed you will not have breast function (lactation nipple changes. ) even with the best reconstruction.
i have a large lump on my left breast scheduled for a mam on friday tonight i had sharp stinging pains radiating across my breast and nipple?
some breast anormalities on mammogram can remain and be seen on future mammograms. if they remain stable there is less concern over them. some abnormal findings may subside. every mammogram should be compared to previous ones to assess any new changes or its stability. please also remember that about 10% of breast cancers may not be detected by mammogram. a clinical exam is also needed since some breast abnormalities can be detected by your physician and not the mammogram.
in japan what is number of people diagnosed with breast cancer each year?
i did not see any recent numbers but in general women in japan develop breast cancer at a lower rate than american women. this is mainly due to diet and lifestyle. see this article for more information: <link>
i had breast cancer a year ago and had a right mastecnomy. now they have found pleural nodules in right and left lower lobes 5mm 4 8mm 2 4mm 4. 5mm should i be worried about lung cancer.?
quite tiny this appears ominous. it would help to know the facts at dx: tumor size nodal status; er pr her-2-neu status. these would influence probabilities. some treatment particularly taxanes can cause pulmonary findings. go over this with you team primarily medical oncologist.
i had breast cancer a year ago and had a right mastecnomy. now they have found pleural nodules in right and left lower lobes 5mm 4 8mm 2 4mm 4. 5mm should i be worried about lung cancer.?
rather than worry get right to your surgeon or other physician you trust and get a definitive diagnosis for the bumps. they may be something as simple as histoplasmosis (the pesky fungus all of us get in kansas) or they may be one of the common ways in which breast cancer spreads. if the latter it should still be manageable often for many more good years but act now.
i am 45 i had a diagnostic mammo along with a ultrasound which determined i have a 1 cm lymph node on my left breast/arm pit do go for a 2nd opinion?
if you have a lymph node that you can feel or you have a family history of breast cancer you should get an evaluation by a surgeon. this sounds like something benign and noncancerous but being proactive is important. at the very least you should have your mammo and ultrasound repeated in 6 months.
is breast cancer risk increased with suspicious bilateral microcalcification clusters and large thickened nodule w/neg. us? how much?
breast microcalcifications are very common some of which may be associated with cancer. radiologists will deem those suspicious enough to warrant biopsy as "birads 4 or 5". if so the next step is to have a (nonsurgical) biopsy for definitive diagnosis. a nodule seen on mammography but not on ultrasound will also be categorized as above. your next step is to speak w/the dr. who ordered the mamm.
is breast cancer risk increased with suspicious bilateral microcalcification clusters and large thickened nodule w/neg. us? how much?
when you state that you have "suspicious" microcalcifications the radiologist means suspicious for cancer or a disease called dcis which is precancerous you should receive a birads number after a mammogram and a sono. it sounds like your birads number is a 4 which means a biopsy is advised you should definitely discuss the findings with your physician.
is there any oral maintenance medicine fot her2 breast cancer after finishing the herceptin (trastuzumab)?
if the cancer is er positive then tamoxifen or an aromatase inhibitor would be beneficial to reduce the risk of recurrence.
is there any oral maintenance medicine fot her2 breast cancer after finishing the herceptin (trastuzumab)?
first very close follow up by the oncologist preventing osteoporosis zometa will help ske ( skeletal related events like fractures joint and muscle problems ) in 40% risk of metastasis in 14 % speak to your oncologist.
is there any oral maintenance medicine fot her2 breast cancer after finishing the herceptin (trastuzumab)?
usually once done we observe.
is a mammogram the most effective way to detect breast cancer?
it is the most effective way to screen for breast cancer. it is easy to do it is cheap it can be done anywhere. it is not the most sensitive nor the perfect tool however. thus it is always advised to combine modalities- breast exam mammogram-and if there is a suspicion- combining mammo and sono and/or mri will be more sensitive to detect breast cancer. ultimately biopsy is to confirm of cance.
is a mammogram the most effective way to detect breast cancer?
it is currently the most cost effective and scientifically validated method we have to screen large populations. in particular situations mri and/or ultrasound may be useful. mri is the most sensitive modality for detecting cancer but long term outcome data is not available it suffers from too many false positives it is expensive time consuming and not widely available.
is a mammogram the most effective way to detect breast cancer?
mammogram is effective but there are other procedures may give a better results such as mri.
is a mammogram the most effective way to detect breast cancer?
it can detect @80% of breast cancers so it is effective but not 100%.
i am pregnant and my husbands mom is on raditation 5 days a week for breast cancer is it safe for me to be around her?
radiation is given in a shielded room. when your mother in law gets radiation it's only in the radiation center and when the machine is off there is no more radiation left in her. these x-ray s just go through the breast and don't stay in the breast. you and any child or baby is 100% safe.
i am pregnant and my husbands mom is on raditation 5 days a week for breast cancer is it safe for me to be around her?
your family member is not dangerous to you or your baby it would be reasonable since you are pregnant to minimize contact with her though.

is breast cancer genetic or caused by the environment or both?
app. 10-15% of all breast cancers are believed to be related to hereditary risks; therefore in a sense the other 85-90% are related to "environmental" factors. unfortunately we don't know what specific triggers are responsible for breast cancer development; but we do know that breast cancer occurs much more frequently in developed countries. this regrettably is a disease of modern life.
is breast cancer genetic or caused by the environment or both?
only 10-20% of breast cancers are genetically related. we are not sure what causes the remainder but environmental factors (such as the organochloride pesticides that were sprayed 30-50 years ago) are potentially responsible. estrogen replacement is contributing to some and the fact that women are living to be older with each generation increases the number of elderly breast cancer.
i got a scar tissue in lung after radiation therapy for breast cancer. no one told me it could happen. what should i do?
well-recognized complication of breast radiation therapy (of course when you are that "one in a million" that doesn't help). modern techniques are designed to maximize rx to the breast & minimize effects on the heart and lungs. your radiation oncologist certainly should have discussed this with you pre-treatment--informed consent is a necessary part of any rx regimen.
i got a scar tissue in lung after radiation therapy for breast cancer. no one told me it could happen. what should i do?
radiation therapy causes a type of burn resulting in injury. hopefully cancer cells are killed but normal tissue heals with some effects of tissue scarring.
i got a scar tissue in lung after radiation therapy for breast cancer. no one told me it could happen. what should i do?
to get some scar tissue in the upper part of the lung just below the ribs. this is often best appreciated on a ct scan. most patients have no change in their breathing function and the risk of developing a temporary inflammation (pneumonitis) is very low but treatable with steroids. this risk is probably lower with modern radiation techniques such as imrt.

radiation therapy (rt) is never a primary treatment for breast cancer but rather a supplement to surgery for the local treatment of breast cancer. rt is mandatory following breast conserving surgery: local recurrence rates are decreased from >25% to <5% with rt. rt is also used after mastectomy for patients that are at high risk for local recurrence.
is radiation effective for breast cancer?
radiation is effective after lumpectomy in reducing the risk of local and regional recurrence. other times it can be given in an advanced breast cancer to slow the growth of the cancer.
is radiation effective for breast cancer?
after lumpectomy radiation cuts local recurrence (recurrence in the breast) from 40% to less than 10%. it is also helpful after mastectomy if the lymph nodes are involved.
is it possible for a 11 year old to develop breast cancer?
it is exceedingly rare but possible.
i'm 20 years old and have a family history of breast cancer. when should i start getting mammograms?
than the age of diagnosis of any close relative with breast cancer or at age 40 (whichever age is lower). as an aside you may want to clarify with a breast doctor just how high your risk is for breast cancer. most cases of breast ca are environmental not hereditary. people have a tendency to assume more risk than may actually be present.
i'm 20 years old and have a family history of breast cancer. when should i start getting mammograms?
depends on the number of family members and their exact relationship to you (grandmothers and aunts don't count as much as mothers or sisters in terms of increased risk). also family history of ovarian cancer raises a major red flag and may warrant genetic testing. family history of uterine and/or colon cancer is also worrisome. best to discuss all of this with someone knowledgable in high risk.
is it possible to have breast cancer without lumps? can other things factor into it such as indentation nipple changes etc.?
yes lumps do not have to be present. all of the things you mentioned are possible signs or symptoms of breast cancer or other changes in the breast.
is it possible to have breast cancer without lumps? can other things factor into it such as indentation nipple changes etc.?
dimpling of the skin and/or nipple inversion are both breast changes that can be associated with breast cancer therefore i recommend that you see your primary care doctor for a referral to a breast specialist. depending on your age and examination findings they may want to get a mammogram +/- ultrasound. of course there are many false alarms but it's better to prove that it's not a cancer.
i read that taking progesterone pills stimulate breast growth. does that mean topical progesterone massaged into the breast will have the same effect?
both estrogen and progesterone affect the breasts. typically estrogen leads to more breast growth but not usually after the breasts have matured. there are associations between progesterone and possible breast cancer if used chronically. any way that progesterone is absorbed with affect the breast.
if i stop ert will breast cancer tumor shrink? also will a benign mass get smaller and less tender?
this problem mandates a real-time (face-to-face) meeting with a doctor. a history has to be taken along with a examination as well as labs and other tests. only after all this will your doctor be in a position to tell you what's wrong and what needs to be done to help you.
if i stop ert will breast cancer tumor shrink? also will a benign mass get smaller and less tender?
stopping ert may help the pain of benign breast lumps but typically will not shrink an established lump. see your doctor - all lumps need to be evaluated thoroughly if they persist more than a couple of weeks.
im 24 years can i get breast cancer?
though uncommon young women (and men) can develop breast cancer. it is more common with certain family histories of breast cancer and there are genetic-related breast cancers. see your md for a breast exam and ask how to do them yourself. do once a month a week after your period. if you have a lump now have it checked out. many benign lumps exist but you don't want to miss an early cancer!
im 24 years can i get breast cancer?
if you have a strong family history of it or if you have found a breast lump you should seek medical advice because early stages may be curable.
im 24 years can i get breast cancer?
you should speak to your doctor about risk factors including family history and genetic screening as well as have regular breast exams.
im 24 years can i get breast cancer?
most breast cancers occur after age 40 but rarely a young woman can get breast cancer. see a doctor for an examination.
i am 24 i have no family history of breast cancer but can i be the first?
the incidence of breast cancer lifetime is 1 in 8 for someone with no risk factors. you could be the first in your family but you have a 7 out 8 chance of not being that"first". breast cancer is very rare in your age group so i would advise not to worry. monthly breast self exam with annual md breast exam is all you need. mammography at age 40.
i am 24 i have no family history of breast cancer but can i be the first?
the vast majority of women with breast cancer have no family history of breast cancer.
i am 24 i have no family history of breast cancer but can i be the first?
not all breast cancer or cancer in general is inherited. so yes you could be the first. if so i am sorry.
i want to know whether radio surgery (cyber knife or gamma knife) is applicable in metastatic breast cancer to liver?
if someone had just one met cyberknife rfa nano knife cryo ablation or surgical resection any of them can be considered. it would be important to biopsy it and make sure what the pathology is as there is a 20% chance of having different pathology compared to the primary breast cancer. that can make a difference in systemic therapy we choose.
i want to know whether radio surgery (cyber knife or gamma knife) is applicable in metastatic breast cancer to liver?
works ok and will reduce tumor burden.
is it common for people who are using herceptin (trastuzumab) as a breast cancer treatment to have raised liver blood test readings?
herceptin (trastuzumab) is a pretty safe drug. as far as i know it does not affect liver functions. but many other drugs including chemotherapy can increase the liver enzymes. you should ask you oncologist to confirm it with the drug manufacturer or from a drug information source.
is it common for people who are using herceptin (trastuzumab) as a breast cancer treatment to have raised liver blood test readings?
liver toxicity is not a common side effect of treatment with herceptin (trastuzumab). it does happen but more frequent causes of abnormal liver tests might be other chemo drugs given with herceptin (trastuzumab).
is there a way to check if i have breast cancer by myself?
although many people recommend self breast exams there is not scientific evidence to support doing self breast exams.
is there a way to check if i have breast cancer by myself?
you can perform breast self examinations but you would only be able to feel a sizeable mass that had already formed. need to combine self examinations with yearly physical examination with your doctor and yearly mammogram after age 40.
i had cancerous calcification on my right breasts. i also had a lumpectomy and radiation but why is the cancer coming back?
there is nothing more frustrating than cancer recurrence especially when one is given a "clean bill of health" after treatment. unfortunately some breast cancers can recur--if its in the breast alone a mastectomy may be necessary; if its elsewhere in the body this requires chemotherapy. if you are unclear about this please discuss at length with your cancer doctor. good luck!
is it possible for a benign breast tumor become cancerous?
most benign breast lesions do not become cancerous. some benign cell types like atypical hyperplasia or lobular neoplasua can indicate increased future risks of breast cancer. need to know more about the cell type you are describing.
is there a type of breast cancer that has more chance of recurrance with time?
stage for stage - triple negative (er- pr- her2-) has the highest recurrence rate. in general hormonally responsive (er+) tumors have lower recurrence rates.
is there a type of breast cancer that has more chance of recurrance with time?
estrogen positive cancer is a felt to be a chronic disease as we are seeing recurrences years later. estrogen negative cancer has a high risk for recurrence up front. meaning if left untreated the risk of recurrence is high. in addition in estrogen negative cancers all we have is chemo and radiation. estrogen positive we have hormone as well. hope this helps.
i am a breast cancer survival - do i need to do the tumour markers blood test -ca153 ca19. 9 ca12. 5 cea afp?
standards of care in the us do not recommend routine tumor marker testing in cancer survivors (we usually do ca 27. 29 for breast cancer). markers are mostly useful to assess response to therapy in patients with advanced cancer. that said many oncologists (myself included) will sometimes order routine markers in cancer survivors depending on the circumstances.
i am a breast cancer survival - do i need to do the tumour markers blood test -ca153 ca19. 9 ca12. 5 cea afp?
although some medical oncologists follow tumor markers there is no proof that aggressive followup for early stage breast cancer extends survival or improves quality of life. they may be useful if you have metastatic breast ca and are being treated with chemo as a way of assessing response. btw afp is for primary liver cancer ca 19-9 for gi malignancies ca-125 ovarian ca - none of these forbreast.
i am a breast cancer survival - do i need to do the tumour markers blood test -ca153 ca19. 9 ca12. 5 cea afp?
tumor marker like 27. 29 can be use in conjunction with physical exam and xray/mammogram to detect cancer recurrent.
i have a red blotch on my breast next to my ariola. is this a sign of breast cancer?
you should bring this to the attention of your friendly primary care physician.
i have a red blotch on my breast next to my ariola. is this a sign of breast cancer?
there's a form of breast cancer called "inflammatory cancer" which presents as red swollen skin on the breast. another type of breast ca is padget's disease but that is usually seen on the areola. both are rare fortunately. if the lesion has been there for a while you should get it checked out. a skin biopsy is the only way to know for certain.
i have a red blotch on my breast next to my ariola. is this a sign of breast cancer?
it sure doesn't sound like it but symptoms like these deserve a full evaluation in person by your health care provider especially when you are concerned about a potentially fatal disease.
i had breast cancer 7yrs ago and my periods stopped due to the treatment but now i think there starting again is that normal?
menses can stop due to chemotherapy and often resume again after some length of time which can be several years later. but if you were over 45 years of age when you began taking chemotherapy then the periods typically stop permanently. base don your age of 52 years now i would advise you to consult your gynecologist so that you can be checked for any other cause of vaginal bleeding.
i had breast cancer 7yrs ago and my periods stopped due to the treatment but now i think there starting again is that normal?
to see your gynecologist and your oncologist.
i'm a 22 year old woman and i've had a sharp painful lump in my breast for weeks. what could be the causes?
breast cysts are common and may be painful. however there are also other types of lumps in the breast. breast cancers are very rare in your age but are not unheard of. i suggest to have a breast evaluation. if you have a painful cyst it can be easily aspirated to alleviate your pain. if the lump is not a cyst it may need a needle biopsy to verify its pathology.
is doederante (anti presperante) causing breast cancer?
not that i know of. we ask breast cancer patients not to use aluminum containing deoderants during radiotherapy to minimize skin reaction (but not because we think it has an impact on oncologic outcome).
is doederante (anti presperante) causing breast cancer?
there is no evidence to support this claim.
is doederante (anti presperante) causing breast cancer?
there is no conclusive research linking the use of underarm antiperspirants or deodorants and the subsequent development of breast cancer. research studies of underarm antiperspirants or deodorants and breast cancer have been completed and provide conflicting results.
i have lymph in my right breast i have no pain in it and it is not moveable. can u call this breast cancer
a fixed mass or nodule in the breast is concerning for a neoplasm (a benign or malignant tumor). the most common breast cancer is invasive ductal carcinoma. however this cannot be diagnosed without an appropriate biopsy of the lesion. it is also recommended that you have breast imaging to further quantify the lesion and if there are any other lesions in either breast. see your physician.
i have lymph in my right breast i have no pain in it and it is not moveable. can u call this breast cancer
a number of things can cause a lump in the breast most are not cancer. a fixed or non- mobile lump is of significantly greater concern and should be checked asap. breast cancer carries a much better prognosis than in the past but time to treatment is crucial.
im 40 year old female started with right breast pain today has had total hysteroctmy what could this be?
are you on hormonal replacement therapy? if yes then that explains. however be careful with hrt and risk of breast cancer. please discuss with your doctor.
i am taking homeopathic medicine for the lump in my right breast. i haven't taken any sort of exam for breast cancer. is it safe?
do you have a history of cancer? i would discuss this treatment with your friendly primary care physician.
i am taking homeopathic medicine for the lump in my right breast. i haven't taken any sort of exam for breast cancer. is it safe?
i am a homeopath. what kind of "homeo medicine" has been prescribed and by whom? please do get a good examination by a physician if you have a breast lump. even breast cancers have a high rate of remission and cure when found early -- but can advance if you wait. not all homeopaths are physicians. a competent one will definitely refer you to a physician for a physical exam!
i am taking homeopathic medicine for the lump in my right breast. i haven't taken any sort of exam for breast cancer. is it safe?
that if you have any specific problems or concerns about your breast that you have this medically assessed. it is best to know what you are dealing with before developing any form of treatment plan.
i am taking homeopathic medicine for the lump in my right breast. i haven't taken any sort of exam for breast cancer. is it safe?
there may be a very simple answer to the lump but it should be checked out. taking any kind of remedy without knowing the cause of the problem is not a helpful approach.
i am presently on herceptin (trastuzumab) taxotere carboplatin. what sort of online support groups are there?
the komen foundation has several sites. asco has cancer information. breast cancer. org is also a great place to look.
i am presently on herceptin (trastuzumab) taxotere carboplatin. what sort of online support groups are there?
www. her2support. org was developed by a woman with metastatic her2 positive breast cancer. it is a great community with a ton of helpful information from the people who know. the patients!
i have lumps in my armpits that don't seem to go away. i am only 19 and feel like breast cancer only happens to older people. what could it be?
breast cancer is quite rare in young women. if you are feeling something that has been there for an extended period of time then you should probably be examined by your personal physician.
i have lumps in my armpits that don't seem to go away. i am only 19 and feel like breast cancer only happens to older people. what could it be?
arm pit lump could be either a cyst hydradenitis or lymph node. if it is a lymph node it is least likely to be cancer in your age group. it is most likely secondary to an upper extremity wound or infection.
i have lumps in my armpits that don't seem to go away. i am only 19 and feel like breast cancer only happens to older people. what could it be?
i agree with dr. dugan that beast cancer is a very unlikely cause for axillary "lumps " especially at your age. best to see a doctor for an examination. could be skin gland issues. ingrown hair irritation lymph nodes etc. have it examined to be able to get better information.
i have been prescribed by urologist estrace (estradiol) 0. 01% cream for vaginal discomfort? i've had breast cancer. doctor knows it but says it would be safe.
the systemic absorption from vaginal estrogen is very minimal and should not be an issue however i would like you run it by your oncologist too.
i have been prescribed by urologist estrace (estradiol) 0. 01% cream for vaginal discomfort? i've had breast cancer. doctor knows it but says it would be safe.
in general vaginal estrogen is very minimally absorbed. we as oncologists use it frequently. if you are worried then don't use it.
i had ultra sound they found few nodules about 4 measuring 1cm i had dull pain at my back and abdomen finished tx for breast ca 4 months ago?
these are likely fibroids and are small; won't be related to breast cancer but they are looking at your ovaries. you may be at higher risk of ovarian cancer if you have the brca 1 or 2 gene. if you get your ovaries removed the hot flashes can be a nightmare. in this case i am good at using non hormones to improve those sx's but the ovaries still produce estrogen which has many good effects.
i had lumpectomy for breast cancer then had to have chemo now drs want me to have radiotherapy i don't want to have anymore treatment should i?
discuss your concerns with your radiation oncologist. not have the radiation will increase the chances the cancer will come back.
i had lumpectomy for breast cancer then had to have chemo now drs want me to have radiotherapy i don't want to have anymore treatment should i?
after lumpectomy radiation plays a key role in decreasing the risk of local recurrence in the breast after lumpectomy. this is a seperate effect than that of chemotherapy. without radiation your local recurrence could be 3-4 times higher. if you fail locally because of foregoing radiation this may put you at risk for metastatic disease as well. please talk to your oncologist and finish treatment.
i had lumpectomy for breast cancer then had to have chemo now drs want me to have radiotherapy i don't want to have anymore treatment should i?
as a patient you have the right to refuse any therapy as long as you are aware of the consequencies of your decision. now radiation therapy will be needed if you only had a lumpectomy- to reduce your recurrence risk to the same breast. that is for your own benefit. you are young which means your risk for cancer recurrence will be quite significant- so you want to reduce it as much as possible.
is it true that estrogen increases the risk of breast cancer?
the use of hormone replacement therapy (hrt) for menopause has been shown to increase the risk for breast cancer when used longer than 5 years. oral contraceptives do not have any relation nor increase in risk of breast cancer.
is it true that estrogen increases the risk of breast cancer?
estrogens are normal to have in the female body. but some women can develop breast cancer particularly due to hormone replacement therapy in older years. most breast cancers are promoted due to estrogens especailly taking them as suplemnts for more than 5 years.
i have a big family history of breast cancer. is there anything i can do to lower the chances of getting it?
it is important to know which members of your family are affected. this will determine if brca genetic testing is needed. i recommend you find a high risk program at a breast center to get a full evaluation and follow up. once they have obtained all the info they can recommend specific risk reducing measures.
i have a big family history of breast cancer. is there anything i can do to lower the chances of getting it?
app. 10-15% of breast cas are of the hereditary type; the best way to determine if this runs in your family is to have an affected member tested for brca mutations. if any are found it's best for you to meet w/a genetic counselor to understand the ramifications of testing. if brca+ the options for prevention include tamoxifen (50% risk-redux) or "prophylactic" mastectomy (95-99% risk-redux).
i had my period when i was 7 years old. now im 23. my question is will i most likely have breast cancer?
early menarche is a risk factor in breast cancer but by itself does not greatly increase risk. other risks include age child bearing history obesity possibly diet and alcohol intake race and family history. keep in mind that the average risk in the us is 1 in 7-8 women will develop breat cancer in their life time. being vigilant and following your docs advice on screening is key.
i had my period when i was 7 years old. now im 23. my question is will i most likely have breast cancer?
the fact that you had early onset menarche does slightly increase the risk of breast cancer. it doesn't mean that you will get it. there are many other variables most important is any family history of breast cancer in mother/sister/grandmother who were premenopausal when diagnosed with breast ca. ultimately ask your gynecologist for some wisdom.
i had my period when i was 7 years old. now im 23. my question is will i most likely have breast cancer?
early onset of menarche is associated with a slightly increased risk of breast cancer however it is but one of many factors. overall women in the us have a 1 in 8 lifetime risk of breast cancer so there is reason enough to be cautious.
i had my period when i was 7 years old. now im 23. my question is will i most likely have breast cancer?
the odds are that you still will not get breast cancer but you are at higher risk than someone who had puberty at a later age.
i had my period when i was 7 years old. now im 23. my question is will i most likely have breast cancer?
although we would need to see more information having a period at seven years of age is early. i would suggest that you get a workup by an endocrinologist. in terms of cancer early onset period increases the chance but it is still only a chance.
if breast cancer reccurs after having had a masectomy will the new growth be benign?
by definition a recurrence of breast cancer is malignant and potentially serious. recurrence can be localized to the breast or chest wall and could potentially be treated by surgical resection or radiation @/or chemotherapy or hormonal therapy. spread to other organs is more serious and is usually beyond surgical control so chemo or hormonal therapy is used.
if breast cancer reccurs after having had a masectomy will the new growth be benign?
medically a "recurrence" after any cancer removal is by definition a cancer- therefore not benign. a new growth must be biopsied or excised and tested to prove if it is benign or malignant.
if breast cancer reccurs after having had a masectomy will the new growth be benign?
if breast cancer recurs someplace else in the body the recurrence is still a cancer (malignant not benign).
is it possible for a breast abscess to lead to breast cancer?
pure abscess is infection not cancer. however a cancerous lump can have "dead" cells within it because it is fast growing overgrowing so necrotic or dead tissue in it can have what looks like "pus".
is it possible for a breast abscess to lead to breast cancer?
in general a breast abscess does not lead to breast cancer but some breast cancers can present as a breast abscess. when being treated for a breast abscess a mass in the breast should be ruled out.
is tamoxifen effective only if the cancer has not spread outside of the breast?
tamoxifen is a very effective drug for the treatment of hormone-sensitive (estrogen receptor +) breast cancers that has spread outside the breast. it may be used alone or in combination with traditional iv chemotherapy depending on the cancer stage. furthermore tamoxifen has been shown to be effective reducing the chance of developing breast cancer in high-risk women ("chemoprevention").
is tamoxifen effective only if the cancer has not spread outside of the breast?
tamoxifen affects cells throughout your whole body so it can treat breast cancer cells that are located anywhere in your body. it does not penetrate your brain very well but works all other places. additionally it can prevent your unaffected breast tissue from developing into a new breast cancer.
i had a lumpectomy for breast cancer and also had chemotherapy as it was grade 3. now the doctors want me to have radiations and take tamoxifen but i'm fed up with the treatment. what should i do?
you are half way done need radiation after lumpectomy for sure. if cancer was estrogen/ progesterone receptors (er/pr) positive you need tamoxifen for added protection to block it from coming back!
i had a lumpectomy for breast cancer and also had chemotherapy as it was grade 3. now the doctors want me to have radiations and take tamoxifen but i'm fed up with the treatment. what should i do?
the purpose of all the treatment is to reduce your risk of recurrence. you are fortunate to have a chance at cure. if it recurs it is deadly. the hardest part is behind you (chemotherapy) yet the most important treatment that lowers your risk the most is what's left. talk to your doctors and counselors! good luck.
i had a lumpectomy for breast cancer and also had chemotherapy as it was grade 3. now the doctors want me to have radiations and take tamoxifen but i'm fed up with the treatment. what should i do?
you must feel understandably tired and worn out after chemo but since you had a lumpectomy (and i assume your cancer was er+) it would be unwise not to complete the recommended treatment. don't be overwhelmed by this. take it one day at a time.
i had a lumpectomy for breast cancer and also had chemotherapy as it was grade 3. now the doctors want me to have radiations and take tamoxifen but i'm fed up with the treatment. what should i do?
congrats for finishing chemo! please do not stop now. if you had a lumpectomy then you need to get radiation to help decrease your chance of the cancer coming back in the lumpectony area. if you skip rad you recurrence rate is 30%. if you do not want to get the rad then you should get a mastectomy. the rad is not as bad as chemo and only takes 7-8 weeks. good luck!
i'm almost two months past chemo for treatment of breast cancer and noticed recently that i'm bruising a little easier than i had before. any insight?
platelet count causes tiny petechiae bruising could be a cause. you need counts and an inr best done by your oncologist.
i'm almost two months past chemo for treatment of breast cancer and noticed recently that i'm bruising a little easier than i had before. any insight?
some patients can bruise easy during or after chemo. u need to call ur pcp or oncologist to check platelet count and coagulation numbers ( pt inr and ptt).
i am 4 years out from breast cancer and still taking tamoxifen a mass was found in the edometrial lining after annual exam biopsy has been your thoug?
while tamoxifen does decrease the recurrence rate of certain breast cancers there is a small but real increase in cancer of the uterine lining. for this reason a biopsy should be performed at any sign of changes in this area. it can usually be done via brushings i. e. without incisions in the gynecologists office.
i am 4 years out from breast cancer and still taking tamoxifen a mass was found in the edometrial lining after annual exam biopsy has been your thoug?
await for endometrial biopsy result. there is a risk to develop endometrial hyperplasia and endometrial cancer while on tamoxifen- the risk will be higher if you are older than 65 years old. how old are you? do you still have your period? if you do not have any more period/post menopausal. - your oncologist can switch you to aromatase inhibitor and stay on the aromatase inh for 5 years. d/w md.
i have lobular neoplasia. is it a likely that i will develop breast cancer in the future?
there is a slightly increased risk of breast cancer with lobular neoplasia but the majority of women with this diagnosis do not get breast cancer. some sites describe a 7 to 11 times increased risk for future breast cancer. tamoxifen may be a consideration for breast cancer prevention. see a breast specialist and consider genetic testing for breast cancer risk analysis.
i have lobular neoplasia. is it a likely that i will develop breast cancer in the future?
lobular neoplasia applies to a range of pathologic changes such as atypical lobular hyperplasia (alh) to lobular carcinoma in situ (lcis). these changes are considered a marker for increased risk for breast cancer of about 30-40% over your life time (average risk is about 12. 5%). there are risk reduction strategies that you can employ. it is best to discuss with a breast care specialist to explore these options. please also check the following link for more info: <link>

this sounds like reflux. i would seek attention from a gastrointestinal doctor.
i have regular attacks of severe right chest and upper back pain. worsen with deep breaths eased temporarily by anti acid. breast cancer history r.
lots of causes of right sided chest pain and back pain. with antacid relief gastric reflux - where stomach acids move backwards up the esophagus - moves up the list. but this could be pneumonia pleurisy gall bladder liver kidney stone and others. you should get it checked out by your doctor.
is it ok to use sauna suit or slimming support when i do my walking exercise? i'm a breast cancer stage 3 patient?
after surgery wearing a sports bra to prevent movement will help with the pain. once you have healed you may wear whatever is comfortable for you.
is it ok to use sauna suit or slimming support when i do my walking exercise? i'm a breast cancer stage 3 patient?
best to check in with your surgeon. the timing of surgery ext of surgery +/- the method of reconstruction and your healing status all need to be considered. if your have need released by your surgeon after postop check and cleared to exercise just make sure you stay well-hydrated.
is it ok to use sauna suit or slimming support when i do my walking exercise? i'm a breast cancer stage 3 patient?
just make sure they are clean and appropriately fitted to your specific body contour. exercise is great!

your question does not appear complete as printed here. please restate the question for a potential answer.
i asked about a lump in my breast. i wasn't specific enough. it is slightly bigger than a pea and is sort of cone shaped. it is almost rock hard but can be moved slightly. it is near the areola. what could it be?
while the majority of breast lumps are benign i strongly recommend that you have this evaluated now. after an exam your doctor will likely recommend a "diagnostic mammogram " which is a mammogram and ultrasound of the breast with the lump. unless the tests show a benign appearing cyst you will likely be advised to have a biopsy to be sure it isn't cancer. breast cancer is treatable; check now!
i am a 43 year old female. i had breast cancer 14 years ago. i have had a knot in the middle of my chest for years. now it has gotten red hard and painful. why could it be?
it is unlikely that this is breast cancer recurrence since it was unchanged for several years and you are 14 years out since diagnosis. however any change in a cancer survivor warrants further evaluation. i would recommend you follow up with your physicians and have them evaluate it.
i am a 43 year old female. i had breast cancer 14 years ago. i have had a knot in the middle of my chest for years. now it has gotten red hard and painful. why could it be?
this scenario needs medical attention. the lesion could be as harmless as an infected hair follicle but could also be your breast cancer returning. it needs immediate biopsy secondary to your history.
i am a 43 year old female. i had breast cancer 14 years ago. i have had a knot in the middle of my chest for years. now it has gotten red hard and painful. why could it be?
have your doctor examine it.
is it okay for an oncologist to do breast cancer treatment without tamoxifen?
tamoxifen is only useful in breast cancers which are estrogen receptor positive(er+). so tamoxifen is of no use if the tumor is er negative. check your tumor's hormone receptor status and you will have the answer to your question>.
is it okay for an oncologist to do breast cancer treatment without tamoxifen?
tamoxifen is a very effective drug for the treatment of hormone-sensitive (estrogen receptor +) breast cancers. it may be used alone or in combination with traditional iv chemotherapy depending on the cancer stage. it has no role in rx of estrogen (-) breast ca. furthermore aromatase inhibitors are an effective alternative to tamoxifen for estrogen (+) breast cancer after menopause.
if i have had 4 breast mass removals but none cancerous (fibroadenomas) could i just get all breast tissue removed so it doesn't happen again?
to have a total mastectomy for benign process might be too much. i offer prophylactic mastectomies to women that are a high risk of breast due to family history personal history or who have positive genetic testing. having fibroadenomas does not increase your risk of developing breast cancer.
if i have had 4 breast mass removals but none cancerous (fibroadenomas) could i just get all breast tissue removed so it doesn't happen again?
yes. history of multiple breast biopsies is a risk factor for the development of breast cancer. if there is a family history- it is even more compelling to do a prophylactic mastectomy. most insurance companies allow for this.
is xeloda (capecitabine) effective for breast cancer?

the tissue transferred in to perform breast reconstruction is not breast tissue and should not have the ability to develop breast cancer. a breast surgeon removes between 96 to 98% of the breast tissue during mastectomy. this is due to the relationship between the skin fat and breast tissue especially when operating around the nipple areolar complex.
is there a chance of getting cancer in the tissue of the breast reconstruction?
breast cancer can come back even after a mastectomy. the risk is very low and is the same whether you have breast reconstruction or not. breast reconstruction does not increase cancer recurrence. it cannot cause a new cancer since no breast tissue is used in the reconstruction. however recurrent breast cancer can grow into surrounding tissues including the chest tissues and reconstructed breast.

no it represents early budding or breast development.
i found a lump on my 9 year old daughters breast. there is no rubor swelling or heat present. is there anyway this could be breast cancer?
highly unlikely. there are some rare instances of breast carcinomas and sarcomas occurring in the pediatric population- however this is rare. most likely - it's a benign (non cancerous process) lump. these benign lumps can occasionally be locally destructive (over taking the normal breast tissue) and need to be surgically removed. see your pediatrician to start. you may need to see a surgeon.
i stopped taking evista (raloxifene) after taking it for 10 years. any consequences?
the primary trial of raloxifene for breast chemoprevention was limited to 5 years of use to match the standard of 5 years of tamoxifen. recent data suggest a benefit of 10y of tam over 5 years for treatment of invasive er+ breast cancer. however the benefit of the extra five years is not seen until after year 10. that suggests that the benefit of that drug holds for 5 years after it is stopped.

im a breast cancer patient but half way through my heceptin. my doctor stopped my treatment because my heart is only working at 42 percent?
that chemo agent can cause weakness of the heart muscle and if your ejection fraction is only 42% then your doctor is being appropriately cautious.
im a breast cancer patient but half way through my heceptin. my doctor stopped my treatment because my heart is only working at 42 percent?
cardiotoxicity occurs in 2-4% of cases with terceptin. this means the drug can cause your heart to weaken. a normal ejection fraction is 50% or greater. if yours is down to 42% it's time to stop the drug.
im a breast cancer patient but half way through my heceptin. my doctor stopped my treatment because my heart is only working at 42 percent?
most pts whose cardiac function declines while on herceptin (trastuzumab) will have the function return to baseline if the drug is dropped. interestingly once the drug is again resumed most don't have a relapse of this cardiac decline. repeat the scan of the heart in a month and see where the cardiac function stands.
im a breast cancer patient but half way through my heceptin. my doctor stopped my treatment because my heart is only working at 42 percent?
herceptin (trastuzumab) has effects on the heart and can lower its pumping function(ejection fraction(ef)). normal value is 50-55%; so 42% is not too bad. it will recover by the time they check it again in 3-4 wks so it is a good idea to stop herceptin (trastuzumab) unless you have not yet had at least 6 months of therapy with herceptin(in which case the oncologist can go back and complete it provided the ef has recovered.
is it true that stage 1 breast cancer patients with no lymph node involvement recommended to take chemo?
typically it depends on the receptor status (estrogen/progesterone/her2) and the size of the tumor. tumors greater than a centimeter are generally prescribed chemotherapy although er/pr+ patients may just get hormonal therapy. the oncotype assay is sometimes used to decide on equivocal cases on when to give chemo. you might want to ask your doctors if this is right for you.
i'm wondering why are tumors still growing after masectomy?

i'm at the age where i need to have mamagram but i have breast implants is there a better method at detecting problems as mamagrams can't show enough?
you should have no problems getting a mammogram with breast implants. they are still be standard screening tool for breast cancer in people with implants. mri is an alternative and can also give you better information about the status of the implant. mri are recommended by implant companies every two years although not a practical recommendation. best to you!
i'm at the age where i need to have mamagram but i have breast implants is there a better method at detecting problems as mamagrams can't show enough?
self exam and mammograms are still the best initial approaches to detecting breast cancer. having breast implants does not change this. properly done and interpreted a mammogram is just as reliable whether there is an implant or not. if there is a question on the mammogram then the patient will be referred for further evaluation.

that means you likely have blood disorder- that is likely completely separate- to the breast cancer diagnosis. you would need to have further evaluation to figure out what kind of blood disorder that is related to the igg lambda. differential diagnosis will include plasma cell disorder vs other lymphoproliferative disorder. go to see your hematologist/oncologist and discuss further with your doctor.
if a woman is diagnosed with breast cancer - would she have the choice to get treatment or not?

i had a stage 1 mic breast cancer clear nodes estpr positive 5 years ago would it have been necessary to remove 13 lymph nodes?
it is now standard to do a sentinel node biopsy first and if a pathologist finds it is negative not to go after other nodes. however it was less clear 5 years ago that this was safe and so many surgeons at that time did full axillary node dissections when removing a breast cancer. one can't say now that that was "wrong" as it was within the standards of care then.
i had a stage 1 mic breast cancer clear nodes estpr positive 5 years ago would it have been necessary to remove 13 lymph nodes?
the standards are changing as to what to do with the nodes. the one agreement is taking the sentinel nodes. the remaining nodes can be left alone depending on circumstances. you can ask your doctor. a wise surgeon told me "the older i get the less i do and the better my results". he was right. sometimes less is more.
i had a stage 1 mic breast cancer clear nodes estpr positive 5 years ago would it have been necessary to remove 13 lymph nodes?
did you have a sentinel lymph node biopsy? or evidence of cancer in your lymph nodes prior to the operation?
i had a stage 1 mic breast cancer clear nodes estpr positive 5 years ago would it have been necessary to remove 13 lymph nodes?
removal of lymph nodes is part of staging procedure for breast cancer. this typically includes taking a sample of what is called a sentinel lymph node(sln). if the sln is negative for cancer cells then no more nodes need to be removed. if the sln shows cancer cells then a complete lymph node removal is recommended. there is recent data that if the tumor in the sln is <2mm one could avoid it.
i had a stage 1 mic breast cancer clear nodes estpr positive 5 years ago would it have been necessary to remove 13 lymph nodes?
you said you hgad clear nodes. removal of 5 or less nodes(sentinal nodes) mean that if negative for tumor the other nodes are also negative. have not heard of a "magic" 13 nodes.
is it really the case that thousands more women die every year of heart disease than breast cancer?

i thought breast cancer also followed paternal lineage. my paternal grandmother and aunt both died in 50's and my cousin is fighting a second occurrence (my age - 50's). i got myself checked but breast center only asked about mom's side.
most inherited breast cancers are associated to mutations in the genes brca 1 and 2. these mutations can indeed come from your father's side. people with suspicious family history like yours should visit a professional with expertise in inherited cancers. good for you for being aware of this.
i thought breast cancer also followed paternal lineage. my paternal grandmother and aunt both died in 50's and my cousin is fighting a second occurrence (my age - 50's). i got myself checked but breast center only asked about mom's side.
either of your parents can transfer cancer genes (i. e. brca1/2) including breast cancer genes.
i thought breast cancer also followed paternal lineage. my paternal grandmother and aunt both died in 50's and my cousin is fighting a second occurrence (my age - 50's). i got myself checked but breast center only asked about mom's side.
the breast cancer genes which have been identified so far are called "autosomal" meaning that they can be passed on through either the maternal or paternal lineages.
i thought breast cancer also followed paternal lineage. my paternal grandmother and aunt both died in 50's and my cousin is fighting a second occurrence (my age - 50's). i got myself checked but breast center only asked about mom's side.
perhaps they keep asking you about your mother's history because you already have told them so much information about your father's family.
i thought breast cancer also followed paternal lineage. my paternal grandmother and aunt both died in 50's and my cousin is fighting a second occurrence (my age - 50's). i got myself checked but breast center only asked about mom's side.
statistically it is only the maternal side of the family and probably only first-degree relatives (mothers sisters aunties) whose history of breast cancer affects a woman's genetic risk.
i have symptoms of what's probably mastitis but worried about inflamatory breast cancer. ?
mastitis is due to an infection. this is usually accompanied with other signs of infection-- fever chills. the appearance of both can be similar. both conditions warrant medical evaluation and treatment. please see a qualified physician soon.
i have symptoms of what's probably mastitis but worried about inflamatory breast cancer. ?
both conditions can be treated. you are worried about the worst possible scenario: inflammatory breast cancer. it is a low liklihood that this is the case. the good news is that we are doing a better job at treating inflammatory breast cancer. neither of these can be diagnosed in this forum. find a breast surgeon or general surgeon in your area to get evaluated and treated if necessary.
i have symptoms of what's probably mastitis but worried about inflamatory breast cancer. ?
a simple skin biopsy will give you the diagnosis.
i have blood discharge from my lright nipple yesterday and a few pin dot sized today. i had a mammogram and ultra sound january 2013 something was found but it was not maligant i don't know medical term?
bloody nipple discharge is never normal. most of the time it is caused by a ductal papilloma. you need a ductogram and possible excisional biopsy to ensure that this is not an early sign of breast cancer. please see a breast surgeon.

i have est/prog + breast cancer fixing to start chemo. what is a recommended birth control?
the chemotherapy itself will probably turn your ovaries off either temporarily or permanently but it is too variable to know for sure. you should not add birth control pills or progesterone iud during chemo for an estrogen sensitive cancer. therefore your best choices are condoms or a copper iud.
i have est/prog + breast cancer fixing to start chemo. what is a recommended birth control?
in your case i would choose a birth control method completely without any hormones until you have finished with your cancer treatment. i recommend the paragard iud. it is extremely effective. the main side effect for most of my patients is heavier menstrual bleeding and some spotting as well. good luck with your cancer treatment!
i have est/prog + breast cancer fixing to start chemo. what is a recommended birth control?
since your cancer is estrogen-sensitive you should never use birth control pills. furthermore your oncologist will be prescribing tamoxifen after you complete ctx and rtx which can cause birth defects. therefore you need an effective non hormonal birth control option. please discuss all options with your ob. btw-have you had brca testing? at your age this is advisable. good luck!

are you taking an antiestrogen such as tamoxifen anastrozole letrozole or exemestane? these medications can lead to joint pains.
i completed chemo in sept radiation in dec. for breast cancer now have deep bone pain in elbows & wrists pain under right upper rib cage. normal?
you would certainly want to let your doctor know. but because many drugs used in chemotherapy affect rapidly dividing cells it is not uncommon for many of them to be associated with some degree of bone pain. thank you for the question.
i completed chemo in sept radiation in dec. for breast cancer now have deep bone pain in elbows & wrists pain under right upper rib cage. normal?
may be related to your doc or could be a symptom of other disease. you should always alert your doctor of new bone pain with a history of breast cancer.

what do you mean by natural? non-surgical? mechanical? weight gain? bio-identical hormones? garments? vacuum devices? duct tape? "chicken-cutlets"? pads? exercises? few of these provide sustained desirable results. hormones may stimulate early breast cancers. expanders may increase breast by vacuum. fat injections are another natural method. see <link>
is a high neutrophil band count normal if you've been diagnosed with breast cancer?
high neutrophil counts are typically associated with acute inflammatory conditions such as infections or post-surgery. they will also be elevated after receiving a hematopoietic growth factor to strengthen the immune system after post-chemotherapy neutropenia (decreased neutrophil count). breast cancer does not directly affect the count.
is a high neutrophil band count normal if you've been diagnosed with breast cancer?
especially if you are taking chemotherapy.
is a high neutrophil band count normal if you've been diagnosed with breast cancer?
bandemia- can be seen in different conditions such as in serious infection or due to certain medication like gcsf- given to support your white blood cell while receiving chemo; or in separate primary bone marrow/ blood problems- like in chronic leukemia for instance. if you are receiving gcsf ( neupogen/neulasta) after your chemo- you could see bands on your blood count -and it is okay. d/w md.
is a high neutrophil band count normal if you've been diagnosed with breast cancer?
these are probably unrelated.
i have a new tiny lump in scar from breast cancer surgery is this a recurrence?
when surgery is performed many hair follicles in the area are disrupted in the area and new cysts can form. cysts are not a problem. however in the area of previous breast cancer we would be concerned about a recurrence so any new lesions must be seen by a dermatologist or the breast surgeon.
i have a new tiny lump in scar from breast cancer surgery is this a recurrence?
it could be a number of things but being new it needs to be evaluated as soon as possible.
i have a new tiny lump in scar from breast cancer surgery is this a recurrence?

thick gray or slightly green pus like nipple discharge is most often secretions from duct ectasia. often seen after late 30"s. see an experienced breast or general surgeon for a thorough exam and counseling. surgery may be required.
is breast cancer that has spread to the lymph nodes cureable?
lymph node (ln) involvement implies the presence of cancer cells "elsewhere" in the body. therefore the chance for cure is dependent on one's ability to kill these cancer cells thru a combination of chemotherapy & one's immune system. fortunately we have many effective drugs to rx breast ca leading to improved cure rates as compared to even a decade ago. ln involvement is not a death sentence.
i have a lump on my brest is it breast cancer?

call back rates vary from site to site but can be 12% or more. your radiologist is just being careful. he or she will review this additional films and let you know if further investigation is necessary. even if you were to have breast cancer remember that only 8-9% of patients with breast cancer die of breast cancer. don't waste your energy worrying. really. good luck.
i had a routine mammogram last week and they want me to come in this week for more umages. im scared to death its cancer.
the majority of things found on mamogram are beign (not cancer). and if it is a cancer this would be the best way to find it . when it is too small to have symptoms and it is only visible on a mamogram. this means that you are finding it very early. women who treat a very early breast cancer have an excellent chance of being cancer free 20 years from now.

lymphedema can be seen after both node dissection and sentinel node biopsy and having a mastectomy or lumpectomy doesn't make a difference. ways to improve this includes (1) compression sleeves (2) arm exercises / physical therapy and (3) weight reduction if overweight or obese. would recommend going to a lymphedema clinic if there is one in your area.
is there a cure yet for secondary lymphadema after breast cancer. i am stage 2 now.
we just performed a combination or procedure this past week for a breast cancer survivor. we performed a total breast reconstruction with a diep flap with vascularized lymph node transfer as well as lymphatic mapping and lymphatic surgery on the effected arm to improve her lymphedema. contact us information.
is there a cure yet for secondary lymphadema after breast cancer. i am stage 2 now.
if you had a mastectomy they probably removed the lymph nodes to determine spread. in doing so the drainage system is disrupted. you will develop edema and swelling more easily. i don't know of any cure however.
i know abnormal lumps on the breast but are there any somewhat clear mental breast cancer symptoms?
early breast cancer has no symptoms. breast cancer may later present as a painless firm breast lump. rarely changes in color of the skin sometimes nipple will get retracted or breast skin pulled inward. best is to have yearly physical examination and mammogram after age 40 before these symptoms occur. any breast lump painful or not should be examined by your doctor.

transaminases (ast and alt) are liver enzymes that if elevated can suggest liver injury. that level is not concerning. continue taking your tamoxifen and follow your treatment plan as discussed.
i am 2 years out from breast cancer diagnosis; idc. tamoxifen. bloodwork shows alt level of 74. my pcp just says to retest 6 mo. should i do more?
the alt is a liver enzyme that can be elevated from liver metastasis. these can be reliably diagnosed with liver ultrasound or ct scan your medical oncologist would give your good advice.
i am 2 years out from breast cancer diagnosis; idc. tamoxifen. bloodwork shows alt level of 74. my pcp just says to retest 6 mo. should i do more?
consider repeat in 3 months.
i have considered evista (raloxifene) comparable to tamoxifen in post er-positive breast ca and the star trial data show fewer side-effects. what do you think?
in the preventive star trial both tamoxifen and raloxifine (evista) were found to be effective in preventing breast cancer. statistically tamoxifen is more effective but also have more side effects. evista (raloxifene) is only approved in post menopausal female while tamoxifen is approved in pre and post menopausal groups. evista (raloxifene) is better if there is an osteopenia or osteoporosis present.
is it actually ok for a girl to be taking birth control pills if her mother had breast cancer?
not all breast cancers are hereditary or with receptors to hormones. because you are younger the risk is smaller. but keep in mind your risk for breast ca is higher than the population. my suggestion is cont with the pill but do monthly self breast checks and do your mammogram every 2 yrs if the history is birads 1 or 2.
i was pillow fighitng with my friend and his knee accidently hit my breast i am worry because i am breastfeeding can hit cause me a breast cancer?
nope.
i was pillow fighitng with my friend and his knee accidently hit my breast i am worry because i am breastfeeding can hit cause me a breast cancer?
enjoy your day.
i was pillow fighitng with my friend and his knee accidently hit my breast i am worry because i am breastfeeding can hit cause me a breast cancer?
there have been some studies that propsed that trauma and the chronic inflamatory state that can follow from blood in the tissues etc. may lead to carcinogenesis (new cancer growth) but at this point i think it is far from proven. there is excellent info on risk factors at <link> i would say it is very unlikely a knee to the breast would cause cancer.
i've been feeling pain under my arm and my nipple not a severe pain. i'm 37. family history of breast cancer (grand mother and mother) should i worry?
while breast cancer is not a common symptom of breast cancer you should discuss your concerns with your friendly primary care physician. in addition ask whether genetic testing is appropriate for you.
i've been feeling pain under my arm and my nipple not a severe pain. i'm 37. family history of breast cancer (grand mother and mother) should i worry?
with 2 immediate family members with history of breast ca you should definitely get it checked out by mri instead of just a mammogram.

i wanted to know when you have breast cancer does the lump hurt when you touch it?
pain is not a common presenting symptom in patients with breast cancer. though it can be it is not common. a tender lump could be a cyst or (also uncommon) an infection (more common in breastfeeding patients). definitely a good idea to see your dr and have an exam find out if you need any imaging done .
is it possible that a breast is it possible thatcer lump be on the armpit or is it possible that it only be on breasts?
but not commonly. if a breast cancer became advanced enough that it spread to enlarged axillary lymph nodes then yes that is possible but not common. see your doctor for an exam to see what it is that you are feeling.

garments have not been shown to cause breast cancer. in a large breast early detection could be a problem however. so have your screening tests performed according to prescribed schedule.
i recently start checking for breast cancer but it's confusing because i always have lumps. how do you know when the lumps are cancerous?
the best way to check for breast cancer is a screening mammogram. it's safe inexpensive and noninvasive; it is most effective after menopause; most recommend starting at age 40. self-examination is not as highly-endorsed but i think it can be a very effective way to find cancers when done often. lastly having a yearly physician exam is important as well.
i recently start checking for breast cancer but it's confusing because i always have lumps. how do you know when the lumps are cancerous?
first you are at the age that you need yearly mammograms. second make sure to do your breast exam at the same time every month. if you do this as routine you will become familiar with your "lumps and bumps" and then you will know if anything changes.
i am 28 and i have been diagnosed with breast cancer. any good idea on how i should spend the rest of my life?
right now your focus should be on assembling a team of doctors that will help you fight this disease. be sure and choose a medical oncologist & surgeon that you are very comfortable with; it may help to see a psychologist as well esp. when you try to deal w/these issues. while the word "cancer" has a tendency to be a life-changer our cure rates are quite high--i hope that's the case for you.
i am 28 and i have been diagnosed with breast cancer. any good idea on how i should spend the rest of my life?
i could say live like there's no tomorrow but given the advances in cancer treatment and not knowing how severe your disease you may have decades of more tomorrows! listen to your doctor make health care decisions that are best for you and spend time with the people you love.
i started my period at 11 (month before my 12th birthday) am i at an increased risk for breast cancer? no family history no births/birth pills?
you are describing only one statistical measurement used in the gsil risk model for breast cancer risk assessment. one minor risk factor by itself does not increase your breast cancer risks. eat healthy don't smoke maintain a healthy weight exercise.
i started my period at 11 (month before my 12th birthday) am i at an increased risk for breast cancer? no family history no births/birth pills?
the gail breast cancer risk model only applies to women 35 years or older. even at age 35 the increased chance from having had early periods rather than unusually late periods is only 0. 1% absolute increased risk over five years. in short early onset of periods alone should be of minimal concern. see <link>
i have scattered fibroglandular densities and 3-4 lumps axillary. should i be worried. breast cancer history on mom's side.
you should be seen and examined by a breast surgeon or a general surgeon with breast surgery experience. they will guide you care and explain other indicated studies such as an ultrasound.
i have scattered fibroglandular densities and 3-4 lumps axillary. should i be worried. breast cancer history on mom's side.
if the physicians treating you were suspicious they could perform a biopsy of the suspicious areas in the breast. lymph nodes are swollen for a lot of reasons and rarely do you palpate or find a very large lymph node even when there is metastatic cancer.

i hav cysts and doctor ask me 4 biopsy and result was good but coz mum had cancer doctor ask me also for mammogram and im 25years whts ur advice 4me?
in women with increased risk because of maternal history of breast cancer mammography starting no later than ten years prior to the age of of the mother at the time of discovery of breast cancer (but not earlier than age 25 and not later than age 40) is advised. bottom line starting now with annual mammograms is a very reasonable approach.
i'm experiencing fibrocystic breast disease for years. i am now after menopause (age 77) is this a risk factor 4 breast cancer?
fibrocystic changes can make it more difficult to examine breasts and therefore may delay diagnosis in pre menopausal women but as a rule there's minimal evidence to suggest that fibrocystic changes increases your risk of breast cancer. just continue self breast exams annual mammography and physician exams yearly. now go and enjoy life. good luck.
i'm experiencing fibrocystic breast disease for years. i am now after menopause (age 77) is this a risk factor 4 breast cancer?
yes in younger women we monitor those with this condition for a slightly higher risk of breast cancer. but as in your case more than 90% of women will never develop this complication. at your age i would not worry about it other than have an annual clinical breast examination done by your family doc or gynecologist for any obvious lumps in your breasts. that is all you need to do.
i am on tamoxifen after breast cancer treatment and bilateral mastectomy and now a complete hysterectomy. how much soy in my diet is safe?
we don't have great data on the effects of soy (and phytoestrogens) on breast cancer. we believe that they act like weak estrogens and may mimic the effects of tamoxifen (thus reducing risk) but in high doses could have negative effects. so it should be safe to eat some soy but avoid large amounts like in supplements or shakes etc.
i am on tamoxifen after breast cancer treatment and bilateral mastectomy and now a complete hysterectomy. how much soy in my diet is safe?
it is better to avoid any soy concentrates or it's products in u r situation !

i'm a 49 year old chinese menopausal woman. i got a lumpectomy done for a dcis interme grade. it was noninvasive. i have completed 6 weeks of radiation therapy. i have no previous history of breast cancer. is tamoxifenrequired?
it is an option. it can help reduce the chance of the dcis coming back as well as the risk of a new second cancer in the future. but these risks are low and tamoxifen has its own risks and side effects. you should discuss the pros and cons with a medical oncologist.
i'm a 49 year old chinese menopausal woman. i got a lumpectomy done for a dcis interme grade. it was noninvasive. i have completed 6 weeks of radiation therapy. i have no previous history of breast cancer. is tamoxifenrequired?
if your dcis was estrogen receptor positive 5 years of tamoxifen is an acceptable (but not obligatory) option. it's main effect though will be to reduce the odds of getting another cancer in the opposite breast. you need to discuss this well with your med onc and be sure that potential toxicity does not outweigh potential benefits. hope you get good news every time you visit your doc.

how can breast cancer occur?
abnormal cells in different parts of breast usually get killed by cells we naturally have in our body--call them "killer cells"one of the theories is these cells don't do their job for some reason and the bad cancer cells keep on multiplying-killing a persons normal cells- sometimes spreading the ca cells to other parts of the body sometimes there is an inherited reason--most we don't know.
how does breast cancer develop?
one normal cell inside your breast mutates (becomes abnormal) and begins to grow. the normal "stop" signal that tell a cell to stop dividing doesn't work so the cells keep dividing. one cell becomes two two become four four become eight etc. it takes millions of cancer cells to form a tumor you can feel.
how does breast cancer develop?
genetics and programmed change or environmental hit of some kind - radiation chemicals food or more likely both ie. two hits with resultant alteration of single cell - we guess---- does it have to be a special cell -stem cell that changes? i do not know the mega millions is only 460 million friday this answer is worth more.

i am 47yrs good health. i never get spots but 2/3 weeks ago ulcer appeared under left breast is it almost certainly breast cancer? straight answer pse
you need to get a biopsy. there is no plan without a diagnosis. you need the tissue diagnosis.
i am 47yrs good health. i never get spots but 2/3 weeks ago ulcer appeared under left breast is it almost certainly breast cancer? straight answer pse
developing a rash is more common than an ulcer. and usually breast cancers will start as a lump in the breast tissue and not as an ulcer on the skin. as we are essentially guessing without the benefit of a proper history or an examination therefore the likely diagnosis would be benign but please go and see our pcp or breast surgeon soon so that they can assess you and give you appropriate advice.
inflammation leftface salivary glands & lymph nodes-no bacterial viralfungal & immune-spinal tap high protein-hx metastatic breast cancer w bone mets?
there is a type of breast cancer called lobular breast cancer that tends to metastasize to lymph nodes and salivary glands. her2 positive breast cancer can also behave this way. i think your swollen salivary glands and lymph nodes are due to metastatic breast cancer. make sure your doctor considers this possibility.
inflammation leftface salivary glands & lymph nodes-no bacterial viralfungal & immune-spinal tap high protein-hx metastatic breast cancer w bone mets?
possible metastasis needs to be ruled out with appropriate biopsies in the area first.
is raloxefene the only breast cancer treatment that helps the bones against osteoporosis and does it build new bone & prevent hip and spine fractures?
evista (raloxifene) or raloxifene is a selective estrogen modulating drug used in post menopausal breast cancers is slightly better than tomaxifen in certain aspects like reducing osteoporoses reduce the incidence of fractures has to be used with caution in presence of vascular renal & heart diseases may cause lethal thromboembolism. speak to your oncologist.
is raloxefene the only breast cancer treatment that helps the bones against osteoporosis and does it build new bone & prevent hip and spine fractures?
ralox. is for high risk patients not a cancer treatment. with hormone (endocrine) treatment for breast cancer bone density should be monitored. calcium and vitamin d as well as sunshine help build strong bones.
is raloxefene the only breast cancer treatment that helps the bones against osteoporosis and does it build new bone & prevent hip and spine fractures?
no raloxifene is not the only drug in its class. another example of a drug with similar efficacy is arzoxifene. they all work the same and have the same side effects. yes raloxifene seems to increase bone mineral density and prevent spinal fractures (there isn't enough data to say on hip fractures however). tamoxifen is the oldest drug in this class and has similar effects on bone.
i feel lumps in my breast should i be worried about breast cancer or cyst?
ask your doctor to check them for you or refer you to a general surgeon who can provide expert help with that issue.
i feel lumps in my breast should i be worried about breast cancer or cyst?
the most likely cause of breast lumps in a teenager are fibrocystic nodules. but please see a doctor for an examination to be sure.
i hav pimple like bump on my left breast n its bin there 4 3years i had no problem but 2day it was hurting n i waited n popped it. is it breast cancer?
some skin lesions on the breast can be cancer but these usually happen to older patients and they have nothing to "pop". this is probably a small skin lesion often called an inclusion cyst. they can get infected or irritated. it may come back but a surgeon can easily remove it if it does.
i hav pimple like bump on my left breast n its bin there 4 3years i had no problem but 2day it was hurting n i waited n popped it. is it breast cancer?
it may have been a benign growth called a sebaceous cyst. just watch and make sure it doesn't get infected from your treatment and you will be fine.
if i test positive for brac gene mutation i get mastectomy with breast implantsin same surgery. how long would be in hospital? how long until normal
immediate reconstruction should be offered to women undergoing mastectomy for prophylaxis and for treatment of breast cancer. one night overnight would be a minimal hospital stay for a women reconstructed with implants only. women who also have muscle flaps as part of the reconstruction tend to stay up to 4 days.
is pregnancy pill occure breast cancer?
not true.
iv'e heard that wearing deorderant may cause breast cancer how true is that? because i will never wear it again just cover your nose.
although there has been considerable discussion about whether or not underarm deodorant could cause breast cancer there is no scientific evidence that there is any relationship. i don't see any reason for you to abandon the use of deodorant for fear of getting breast cancer.
iv'e heard that wearing deorderant may cause breast cancer how true is that? because i will never wear it again just cover your nose.
while this has been a popular topic online there is no conclusive evidence linking breast cancer to the use of deodorants and antiperspirants. nevertheless the active ingredient in antiperspirants aluminum hydroxide and a preservative used in some deodorants parabens may both have estrogen-like effects on breast tissue. until we know more i suggest that you use non-paraben deodorants.
iv'e heard that wearing deorderant may cause breast cancer how true is that? because i will never wear it again just cover your nose.
no relation. please continue smelling well.
iv'e heard that wearing deorderant may cause breast cancer how true is that? because i will never wear it again just cover your nose.
when this turned up on the internet i examined it and wrote a bit about it <link> pathguy. com/antipers. htm my correspondents actually traced it to somebody who was selling an alum-based not-very-effective "alternative" product. if you've got body odor you're likely to lose your job and they may not even tell you why. don't be a sucker and please forgive my frankness.
iv'e heard that wearing deorderant may cause breast cancer how true is that? because i will never wear it again just cover your nose.
that is a wives tale which isn't all that uncommon. deodorants and antiperspirants can interfere with mammograms and breast ultrasounds but do not cause cancer of the breast.
is it normal to have long heavy periods (11 day) after treatment for breast cancer. i don't take any medication as i was triple negative. ?
long heavy periods can occur at any time but it is not normal after treatment for breast cancer. if you received chemo for your triple neg cancer then periods usually go away. heavy bleeding means you need to see your gynecologist for evaluation.
is it possibility that i'm developing breast cancer since my dr. said i have cystic breasts?
breasts don't predispose to breast cancer. however they can make the diagnosis more difficult because of the complexity of the breast tissue on mammography. ultrasound of "lumps" will either show cysts or unremarkable glandular tissue. sometimes mri is used when there is a question. also biopsy may also be required if a palpable lump is clinically suspicious even when all other tests are normal.
i had breast cancer and developed severe osteoporosis whilst on arimidex/ooph now on strontium ranelate. is evista (raloxifene) a safer med or are they similar?
evista is a good medicine to prevent osteoporosis. since you already have osteoporisis for you the best medicine would be one of the bisphosphonates(there are several to choose from). examaples include zoledronic acid(zoedronate) fosamax and boniva (ibandronate).
is there a safe treatment for heavy periods after triple negative breast cancer. am not on any medication or contraception.
you are very young and had a triple negative breast cancer. i do not know about uk standards for brca testing but you could carry a brca mutation (especially brca1). if so preventative hysterectomy with ovarian surgery would be a consideration and that would take care of your problem. discuss it with your doc. best to you.
i'm a 17 year old male and i have a little lump under my left nipple it hurts a little when i apply pressure on it do i have male breast cancer?
please see your doctor. given your age and gender breast cancer is extremely unlikely. however you need to find out what this is.
i'm a 17 year old male and i have a little lump under my left nipple it hurts a little when i apply pressure on it do i have male breast cancer?
this is probably gynecomastia a little bit of breast development from teen hormones. being a teen is difficult enough without this. have your physician take a look; removing it is a simple procedure.
i'm a 17 year old male and i have a little lump under my left nipple it hurts a little when i apply pressure on it do i have male breast cancer?
it is common for teenage males to develop a small amount of breast tissue under the nipple which is called gynecomastia. it feels like a firm nodule and can be moved around a little bit. usually a little tender. that said the other doctors that commented on this answer are absolutely right. any new lesion has to be examined by a doctor & possibly some imaging studies done. please see your doctor.
in breast cancer how quickly does a mass turn to a lump?
at your age the odds are any lump is benign. however by the time you feel a lump it could already be cancer. please see your doctor for a complete history and physical and if appropriate additional imaging with ultrasound and perhaps mammography. given your age us first may be useful since if the lump is really a simple cyst a mammogram may not be necessary.
i want to know what is the difference between regular breast lumps and breast cancer lumps?
both cancer and normal lumps can feel the same. it is best to get it checked out. c ur doctor.
if i surgically remove growth does that reduce life span or breast cancer mortality?
please rephrase your question: "growth surgically" does not make sense to me.
if stage 4 breast cancer mets to the brain causing multiple lesions and a lot of swelling why would a neurosurgeon suggest surgery? to do what?
it may be that one or more of the lesions is in a location which is at high risk for pushing the brain stem against the base of the skull causing a more immediate risk of death. it also depends sometimes on the status of the disease elsewhere in the body- if there was no other active disease clearing it from the brain would put the patient in remission even if temporarily.
if stage 4 breast cancer mets to the brain causing multiple lesions and a lot of swelling why would a neurosurgeon suggest surgery? to do what?
they can increase in size and cause pressure on the brain and if they lie in critical areas then the patient will have a neurological deficits. so to prolong life and the quality of it it may be necessary to undergo surgery.
if stage 4 breast cancer mets to the brain causing multiple lesions and a lot of swelling why would a neurosurgeon suggest surgery? to do what?
the number size location symptoms activity of the breast cancer elsewhere and time from your original diagnosis unitl metastasis has appeared there may be a role for surgery "radiosurgery" which is a form of focal radiotherapy m or while brain radiotherapy discuss this with a team - medical oncologist radiation oncologist and neurosurgeon.
if stage 4 breast cancer mets to the brain causing multiple lesions and a lot of swelling why would a neurosurgeon suggest surgery? to do what?
that good luck to you that? needs to be answered by a neurosurgeon so please ask the neurosurgeon why i am sure he would be happy to explain why i assume to help releive the pressure and swelling on the brain but i am sure he would expalin everything to you in detail so please call him.
is it true that lefties are more prone to breast cancer?
i do not believe it matters.
i had 1mm bc grade 3 and had a lumpectomy which took it all then a mastectomy tamoxifen for 2. 5yrs then ooph and armidex what are chances of recurre?
sadly the recurrence rate of breast cancer is impossible to get down to zero. ask your oncologist to develop an estimate for you. the key to treating recurrences is catching them early so stick to your follow up plan very strictly! but that said it does no good to worry. count your blessings every day use the phrase "i love you" a lot and read "love medicine and miracles" by dr. siegel.
i'm wondering why are there more fundraisers to end breast cancer than any other type of cancer?
komen was one of the 1st organizations to help draw attention to breast cancer and bring it out of the shadows. organizations like komen and avon have funded a large portion of the research and community activities in the country. women are vocal about issues near and dear to them. other conditions can get publicity it takes a person to champion the cause and others to follow.
is it true hrt causes breast cancer and uterine? how long shld i stay on it? cancer runs on my side espec. breast cancer my mom. aunt ovarian cancer
certain hormones especially longer use of estrogens can increase a person's risk of breast cancer. estrogen is listed as a known carcinogen on the fda web site & there is a class action lawsuit ongoing against premarin (conjugated estrogens). see site: <link>
is it true hrt causes breast cancer and uterine? how long shld i stay on it? cancer runs on my side espec. breast cancer my mom. aunt ovarian cancer
carefully as there is a lot of hyperbole and conflicting information on this issue. the studies linking hrt to breast cancer only showed a link in one group of women on one type of estrogen/progesterone pill. the women on estrogen alone actually had lower incidences. don't believe the hype find out as much factual info as you can and make the intelligent decisions that you feel comfortable with.
i'm 58 & had breast cancer 2x. drs won't prescribe any type of estrogen because of this. sponteniety shot due to vaginal dryness. what else can i do?
such as ky jelly and vaginal moisturizer such as replens may do the trick. god bless you! <link>
i'm 58 & had breast cancer 2x. drs won't prescribe any type of estrogen because of this. sponteniety shot due to vaginal dryness. what else can i do?
rub it in you vagina regularly and it helps so much with vaginal dryness
i have been prescribed phytoestrogens in pills to alleviate hot flashes of my premenopause. is ii effetive? is it risky on breast cancer?
estrogen is estrogen. the source doesn't matter. any amount of exogenous (from outside your body) estrogen raises the risk of breast cancer. the effect is dose-related that is the more estrogen the higher the risk. although your increase in risk is probably slight why not use the old tried and true methods a cool cloth on your forehead? menopause is natural.
is there anyway to avoid weight gain and hair loss while on tamoxifen?
tamoxifen related hair loss is androgenetic due to blockade of the female hormones. one of the first steps we have to treat female (or male) pattern hair loss is topical minoxidil. it does not involve any hormones and therefore should not interfere with your treatment of breast cancer. also thyroid problems can contribute to hair loss as can iron deficiency. i suggest having both checked.
i'm just wondering if you've had symptoms of breast cancer for several months is it safe to assume it's benign?
what symptoms are you referring to? if you have a mass i recommend evaluation by your doctor and a mammogram. there are many benign noncancerous masses that can occur in the breast. you do not want to guess or try to get a diagnosis in this type of forum. please get evaluated by a doctor to get the right answer.
is radiation treatment always necessary? as in after a lumpectomy for stage 1 breast cancer will a doctor always assign that you get radiation treatment or does it depend on the patient?
a lumpectomy alone is insufficient rx for invasive breast cancer; radiation therapy is always necessary to lower the risk of local recurrence except under unusual circumstances (ie elderly pt w/small tumor& very poor health). dcis (stage 0) may sometimes be treated by lumpectomy alone depending on unique patient & tumor characteristics.
is radiation treatment always necessary? as in after a lumpectomy for stage 1 breast cancer will a doctor always assign that you get radiation treatment or does it depend on the patient?
lumpectomy for breast cancer is followed by radiation treatment for local control.
i have invasive lobular carcinoma stage 2b grade 2 spread to 1 lymph-node. estrogen + her2 - should i consider genetic testing?
breast cancer at age 33 meets criteria for brca testing. the results may significantly impact one's surgical treatment decision (best to do before radiation therapy since this would be unnecessary if one opts for mastectomy). that said without any other risk factors the statistical probability of being brca (+) is not that high. please see a genetic counselor.
how is lcis is different from dcis?
dcis is a pre-cancerous condition that if left untreated could turn into a cancer. it is often detected by mammography. lcis is not pre-cancerous however women who are found to have lcis are at an increased risk of developing breast cancer (in either breast). it is usually not detectable by mammography and is often found incidentally at the time of biopsy.
how prevalent is breast cancer?
globally breast cancer is the most frequently diagnosed cancer and the leading cause of cancer death in females. there are 226 870 (female); 2 190 (male) estimated new cases of breast cancer in the united states in 2012.
how prevalent is breast cancer?
the prevalence of a cancer represents how many people have the disease at a given time. the most recent us statistics quoted above are from the national cancer institute.
how do you treat an intraductal papilloma of the breast?
intraductal papillomas are benign tumors found commonly within the nipple ducts. they are often responsible for bloody nipple discharge. treatment depends on their location within the breast: if it is next to the nipple it can often be safely watched. in contrast those found within the periphery of the breast should be surgically removed since they are occasionally next to breast cancer.
how can you prevent breast cancer?
we are not able to control most risk factors for breast cancer such as being female aging and family history. we can control our weight as obesity is linked to an increased risk of breast cancer. in addition we can perform routine screening. early detection leads to the best chance of a cure. limit your alcohol intake have babies breast feed and increase your physical activity.
how can you prevent breast cancer?
you can't prevent breast cancer with any certainty. what you can do is reduce your risk of developing breast cancer by eating healthy exercising avoiding obesity limiting alcohol consumption as well breast-feeding avoiding post-menopausal hormone replacement etc. but some women are genetically pre-disposed and will get breast cancer despite a "healthy lifestyle".
how can you prevent breast cancer?
women at high risk for breast cancer may reduce their cancer risk by as much as 50% by taking tamoxifen or raloxifene for 5 years. these drugs are not without side effects or risks; consult with a breast surgeon or a medical oncologist to learn the pro's and con's.
how does breast cancer spread into the rest of the body?
breast cancer can spread in 3 basic ways - it can grow larger and larger invading into the skin or muscle; it can invade into the blood vessels and then travel to other areas of the body (most commonly liver lungs bone and brain) and it can invade into the lymphatic vessels and travel to the lymph nodes under the arm and other areas of the body.
how does breast cancer spread into the rest of the body?
breast cancer spreads through your lymphatic system.
how does breast cancer spread into the rest of the body?
most breast cancers arise from the ducts or lobules of the breast. an invasive cancer breaks out of these structures and enters into the supporting tissue of the breast where the lymphatics and blood vessels are found. the cancer cells may enter into these tubes and travel throughout the body.
how serious or dangerous is breast cancer?
it depends on the type of breast cancer the "stage" (ie how big or small whether it has spread to lymph nodes) and other factors. most breast cancer is detected early and cured. left untreated breast cancer can definitely lead to death. overall compared to other cancers breast cancer has a very good prognosis. more than 85% of women are alive 5 years after diagnosis!
how serious or dangerous is breast cancer?
it depends on the type and stage of the breast cancer. breast cancer can be very serious and dangerous.
how serious or dangerous is breast cancer?
very can kill you.
how quickly does breast cancer grow?
it is estimated that by the time a cancer is detected on a mammogram it has probably been present for 2 years and that it takes an average of 5 years to become palpable. however the growth rates of different breast cancers can vary substantially.
how quickly does breast cancer grow?
each cancer is unique. some cancer cells grow very rapidly have the ability to metastasize very early in their development while others grow much slower and are late to metastasize. this is very difficult to predict.
how accurate is an ultrasound for breast cancer?
when ultrasounds are used to evaluate a palpable lump or a mammographic abnormality a directed ultrasound can very accurately differentiate a benign tumor from a malignant one. nevertheless it is best to not rely exclusively on an ultrasound and to proceed to tissue diagnosis via biopsy especially for women over age 40.
how accurate is an ultrasound for breast cancer?
breast cancer usually makes or presents as a mass or tumor or a lump. ultrasound is very accurate in such cases and may be used to do a biopsy.
how commonly does breast cancer occur?

how commonly does breast cancer occur?
based on recent statistics compiled by the national cancer institute us women have a lifetime risk of 12% of getting breast cancer. since this incidence increases with age a more pertinent statistic is the 10-yr risk based on age. for example a 40 yr old woman has a 10-yr risk of 1. 5%. in contrast a 60 yr old woman has a 3. 5% 10-yr risk.
how are men tested for breast cancer?
when a new breast lump is found in either a man or woman a biopsy is necessary to determine if a cancer is present. men at high risk for breast cancer can also have mammograms to screen for cancer.
how are men tested for breast cancer?
the usual scenario is that a man feels a lump in his chest. we always start with a history and physical and then may order a mammography and/or ultrasound for further diagnosis.
how does breast cancer develop exactly?
breast cancer is a type of cancer which originates in the ductal lining of the breast. cells become abnormal and then become invasive and spread outside the ducts. cancer cells can then travel to distant sights in the body through the lymphatic channels.
how does breast cancer develop exactly?
cont'd: cancer cells are unique in that they also develop the ability to break off form the mother cell land somewhere and grow into new tumors by just continually dividing like the mother cell. this is called metastasis.
how does breast cancer develop exactly?
this question gets into the dna level of tumor formation. basically any tumor starts with a cell that somehow loses its aability to stop dividing thereby making copies of itself. so a tumor cell just keeps dividing thereby increasing its numbers exponentially over time. cont'd.
how exactly is breast cancer transmitted?
it is essential that you know that breast cancer is not "transmitted" like an infectious disease. it is not contagious (though there is a mouse form that is passed mother-to-daughter). a woman develops breast cancer through mutations over the course of many years. hope this is the answer you sought and good luck.
how exactly is breast cancer transmitted?
most likely multiple factors at play including genetics exposures (including alcohol) and hormonal factors.
how does breast cancer appear like on a mammogram?
breast cancer can appear as a spiculated mass cluster of tiny calcifications smoothly marginated mass area of subtle distortion or be invisible on mammogram. some tumors are only seen on ultrasound and a few are only felt by you or your doctor. the point is that the appearance of tumors on mammogram is quite variable.
how does breast cancer appear like on a mammogram?
irregular with multiple crab like projection.
how does breast cancer appear like on a mammogram?
mammograms will often detect areas that are more dense than normal breast tissue or that have little flecks of calcium within milk ducts. these may be categorized based on risk with those that are deemed suspicious warranting a biopsy. of those abnormalities that are biopsy-worthy about 15-30% end up being cancerous.
how does breast cancer appear like on a mammogram?
breast cancers can have multiple appearances: round mass irregular mass asymmetry distortion of normal architecture microcalcifications skin thickening nipple retraction skin retraction abnormal lymph node.
how can breast cancer develop?
one normal cell inside your breast mutates (becomes abnormal) and begins to grow. the normal "stop" signal that tell a cell to stop dividing doesn't work so the cells keep dividing. one cell becomes two two become four four become eight etc. it takes millions of cancer cells to form a tumor you can feel.
how can breast cancer develop?
takes years unless you have a particularly fast growing type associated with brca1 and brcaii genes.
how will i be able to tell if i have breast cancer?
the two most common ways are through regular screening with mammogram tha identifies an abnormality or through breast exam (either self breast exam or your medical provider's exam).
how will i be able to tell if i have breast cancer?
the majority of breast cancer patients have no symptoms at all. others may feel a new lump have nipple discharge or experience skin changes. it is important to have mammograms and a clinical breast exam by your medical provider to detect and abnormalities when they first occur. early detection offers the best change for a cure.
how is stage iv breast cancer different from stage iii breast cancer?
in stage iii the cancer still hasn't spread far beyond the breast and nearby lymph nodes. however in this stage there typically are many lymph nodes involved or the tumor is so large it extends to the chest wall or involves the skin of the breast. stage iv breast cancer has spread to distant sites of the body.
how is stage iv breast cancer different from stage iii breast cancer?
stage iv breast cancer means that the cancer has spread to another organ such as the lungs liver or bone. stage iii cancer describes a cancer that is large has grown into the chest wall or skin of the breast and/or is extensively involving the adjacent lymph nodes.
how is breast cancer passed down in families?
2 genes are commmonly tested for called brca1 & 2. they are inherited from either male or female lines [not sex-linked] meaning history of breast cancer from both mom & dad's side are important.
how is breast cancer passed down in families?
there are currently two known genes that cause breast cancer called brca1 and brca2. these genes are inherited in an autosomal dominant manner meaning that if one of your parents has the gene you would have a 50% chance of having it as well. there are also most likely many other genes that cause breast cancer that have not yet been identified. know you risk and speak to your doctor.
how is breast cancer transmitted?
breast cancer is not transmitted from one person to another. it starts as a normal cell in the breast. the cell is damaged and instead of dying it starts dividing making more damaged cells that also divide. that's breast cancer in a nutshell. breast cells that keep dividing and don't stop.
how is breast cancer transmitted?
breast cancer cells travel through the body via the lymphatic system. the lymphatic system is a series of vessels that drain lymphatic fluid throughout the body. lymph nodes are lima bean sized organs that filter the fluid for foreign particles and cancer cells. a sentinel lymph node is the first lymph node to which a cancer spreads.
how does alcoholism affect chemotherapy for breast cancer?
alcohol in excess can adversely effect every organ in the body except the kidneys. chemotherapy can be quite damaging to the organs as well and may interfere with how the various drugs are metabolized and broken down by the liver. i suggest that you check out: www. aa. org. good luck.
how does alcoholism affect chemotherapy for breast cancer?
alcoholics may have liver dysfunction or vitamin deficiencies which could worsen the effects of chemotherapy.
how do you usually treat atypical hyperplasia in a breast biopsy?
when atypical hyperplasia is found at the time of a nonsurgical needle biopsy it is often recommended to remove a little more tissue with a surgical biopsy to be certain that this did not miss a cancer. assuming only atypia is seen this is not a pre-cancerous condition but rather a marker for a 2-4 fold increased risk for breast cancer. therefore careful follow-up is recommended.
help please! is breast cancer painful?
breast cancer is usually diagnosed at the time of a screening mammogram before it has reached a size detectable by palpation; when that small it is rarely painful. once the cancer has grown to the point where it can be palpated it still may not be painful depending on its location in the breast and how rapidly it's growing.
help please! is breast cancer painful?
most breast cancers are not painful with some exceptions. a rare type of breast cancer can be very painful. this is called inflammatory breast cancer (ibc). many doctors aren't aware of ibc so it's important you know about it! if you develop severe pain redness swelling bruising or dimpling in your breast or armpit area see a doctor immediately! and ask "could this be ibc? ".
help please! is breast cancer painful?
in general. no. breast cancer is typically a painless palpable lump or it's a mammographical painless finding. inflammatory breast cancer is an aggressive variant that can be painful as it involves the skin. advanced cancer that has grown into the skin or chest wall can also be painful.
how fast does invasive ductal carcinoma spread?
tumors that are grade 3 or that have a high "proliferation rate" may spread more quickly than grade 1 or 2. tumors that are er- (estrogen receptor negative) or her2+ spread more quickly than other types. inflammatory breast cancer of any type can spread in days; the other types of invasive ductal carcinoma generally take months.
how fast does invasive ductal carcinoma spread?
breast cancer invasive ductal carcinoma (idc) "spread" rate depends on multiple factors including: cancer size location biologic characteristics when found therapy.
how is a mammogram done for a woman with breast implants?
the same machines are used to perform mammograms on women with implants. the goal is to displace the implants as much as possible in order to see the breast tissue. this is made much more difficult when the implants are placed above the muscle rather than below. while the quality of these mammograms are good i still advise women at high risk for breast cancer to avoid implants.
how much radiation and chemotherapy am i likely to need for breast cancer?
following a lumpectomy radiation therapy is usually given "from the outiside-in" over 7 weeks; select people may be treated over 4 weeks. an alternate method is to treat "from the inside-out" via brachytherapy over 5 days. chemotherapy when indicated is typically given in 4-8 doses separated by 2-3 weeks over 3-6 months; herceptin (trastuzumab) is usually given over an entire year.
how much radiation and chemotherapy am i likely to need for breast cancer?
it depends on the stage of your disease and the specifics of your tumor. this is best discussed with your radiation oncologist and your medical oncologist.
how high is my breast cancer risk if two of my aunts and one of my cousins each had it twice?
it would depend if your aunts developed breast cancer before menopause. if they did this would place you at a higher risk than the average population.
how high is my breast cancer risk if two of my aunts and one of my cousins each had it twice?
traditional formulas used to calculate risk of breast cancer take into account many factors including first degree relatives (mother daughter sister) with a history of breast cancer. i would ask your aunts or cousins if they were seen by a genetic counselor since a simple blood test exists to see if they carry the brca mutation. if so you may also get tested to see if you inherited this.
how common is breast cancer among men?
less than 1% of all cases of breast cancer diagnosed in the us annually are in men. the lifetime risk of a man developing breast cancer is about 1:1000.
how common is breast cancer among men?
although it is rare breast cancer can occur in men as well. men possess a small amount of nonfunctioning breast tissue that is concentrated in the area directly behind the nipple on the chest wall. in a recent large international population-based study men represented 0. 6% of all breast cancer patients. <link>
how does breast cancer spread? is it contagious?
breast cancer can spread inside the body of the person with cancer but it doesn't spread to other people! individual cells can leave the tumor and move through the bloodstream or lymph channels to other parts of the body causing the cancer to grow in other places.
how does breast cancer spread? is it contagious?
breast cancer spreads through your lymphatic system. it is not contagious.
how does breast cancer spread? is it contagious?
breast cancer does not spread from one person to the next like an infection. a minority of breast cancers occur in women with a hereditary form of breast cancer that can be passed on to first-degree relatives.
how do you diagnose breast cancer?
diagnosis is made through a biopsy that is either performed through the skin with a needle or by a surgical procedure.
how do you diagnose breast cancer?
clinical examination of the breast digital mammogram sonogram of the breast or mri of the breast biopsy of the lesion are all important in making a diagnosis of breast cancer. sometimes just part of them is needed sometimes all of them are needed to be done. however biopsy of the lesion/lump is the only thing that can give a definitive answer whether a lump is malignant or benign.
how do you diagnose breast cancer?
a definitive diagnosis of cancer can only be reached by looking at tissue under the microscope. most breast cancers are found at the time of routine yearly mammograms or by palpation of a lump on self-examination or routine physician visit. if an abnormality is found that warrants biopsy this can usually be done non-surgically.
how can you detect breast cancer?
a majority of breast cancers diagnosed in the us are detected by screening mammography before they can be palpated. mammograms however are not perfect so self-examination monthly and yearly physical examination are important as well. in select cases an mri may be used to detect breast cancer.
how can you detect breast cancer?
the most common method of detecting breast cancer is through imaging either mammograms ultrasound or mri. in addition some cancers are detected through physical exams.
how do birth control pills affect your risk of breast cancer?
you are thought to have a slight increased risk if you use the pill for over 10 years although some studies show that people who use birth control pills and develop breast cancer have a less aggressive form.
how do birth control pills affect your risk of breast cancer?
there is no scientific data to show that birth control pills contribute to breast cancer. however once a woman has had breast cancer taking birth control pills may increase her risk of recurrence.
how can i take precautions against breast cancer?
to prevent breast cancer 1. maintain a healthy weight. obesity increases your risk 2. have children. (this decrease your risk) 3. limit your alcohol intake 4. breast feed 5. increase your physical activity.
how can i take precautions against breast cancer?
there are a few things you can do to lower your risk of breast cancer. if you have a strong family history consider getting checked for the brca genetic marker. on more practical basis limit alcohol consumption to no more than a drink or 2 per day (and mostly red wine). there is some evidence that regular exercise and avoiding weight gain make a difference.
how can i take precautions against breast cancer?
check your breasts for lumps. get a yearly physical. ask your doctor to examine your breasts. get a screening mammogram.
how might a man detect breast cancer without going to a doctor?
it is usually detected as a lump behind the nipple. that being said a benign condition called gynecomastia is far more common in men than breast cancer.
how might a man detect breast cancer without going to a doctor?
males have breast tissue but is undeveloped. generally males detect breast cancer when feeling a lump. only a physician can evaluate a mass to determine if is breast cancer. this may involve physical exam ultrasound mri ct and biopsy. because male breast cancer tends to be aggressive it is important to be worked up urgently.
how might a man detect breast cancer without going to a doctor?
know your body and any developing change. same for the ladies - vip- visual inspection in the mirror for nipple deviation retraction bloody discharge. palpation - feel for lumps or something "felt" on one side different from the other. and any change from your norm. and always ask the doctor even if being seen for something more trivial - a cold -this is your chance.
how common is it to get breast cancer as a teenager?
the statistical probability of getting breast cancer in your teens is lower than the odds of winning the lottery. breast cancer rates increase the older you are and are rarely seen before the 30's.
how common is it to get breast cancer as a teenager?
it would be exceedingly rare.
how common is it to get breast cancer as a teenager?
some hereditary forms of breast cancer may arise in young women but remain rare in the teens and twenties.
how effective is radiation therapy for breast cancer?
radiation therapy (rt) is never a primary treatment for breast cancer but rather a supplement to surgery for the local treatment of breast cancer. rt is mandatory following breast conserving surgery: local recurrence rates are decreased from >25% to <5% with rt. rt is also used after mastectomy for patients that are at high risk for local recurrence.
how effective is radiation therapy for breast cancer?
most ladies will have two options for treatment of the primary breast cancer at the time of diagnosis:mastectomy/axillary sampling or breast conserving therapy(bct). bct is a combo of the removal of the "lump" sample axilla and radiation to the breast. both of these options have the same local control rate(meaning the same chance the cancer will come back) and the same cure rate.
how effective is radiation therapy for breast cancer?
radiation is effective for reducing the risk of local recurrence (breast cancer coming back in the breast. ).
how can i check my breasts for lumps and early forms of breast cancer?
regardless of age all women can benefit from monthly breast self-examination. in addition it is recommended to see a physician yearly for breast examination and to have yearly mammograms beginning at age 40.
how can i check my breasts for lumps and early forms of breast cancer?
best to have a clinical breast exam performed by a trained physician and when appropriate start mammographic screening.
how can i be supportive of my best friend who has breast cancer?
be there for her. ask her what she needs help with and above all listen.
how can i be supportive of my best friend who has breast cancer?
your are her friend -so being there to support and comfort and to listen to her is great. but also to listen for her when she meets the doctors - take notes and reiterate what they said afterwards- as she will forget or she will let her mind wander toward her kids or husband eg. ask questions for her that she discussed with you be careful with medical advise though- you are her friend.
how can i be supportive of my best friend who has breast cancer?
to help her understand and remember. make sure she gets to see each: oncologist general surgeon plastic surgeon before deciding on best treatment option. help keep up good nutrition light exercise avoidance of people with infections discuss what to do about hair loss in advance make sure multiple nausea rxs available and taken in advance if chemo tobegiven make tshirts helpake work arrangement.
how does tamoxifen actually work?
some breast cancer cells have receptors on them that bind to estrogen in order to grow. tamoxifen acts as an "antagonist" and blocks estrogen from binding to these receptors on the cancer cells by binding to them first. with tamoxifen sitting in estrogen's place the cancer cell can no longer grow.
how does tamoxifen actually work?
tamoxifen blocks the estrogen receptor present on er+ breast cancer. it is a serm.
how is a subcutaneous mastectomy different from a normal mastectomy?
a subcutaneous mastectomy removes as much breast tissue as possible without removing any skin of the breast. this may sometimes be performed on women who are at high-risk for breast cancer to lower their risk; it is not an acceptable surgical treatment of breast cancer.
how quickly does breast cancer normally metastasize?
each cancer is unique. some cancer cells have the ability to metastasize very early in their development while other can be slower to metastasize.
how quickly does breast cancer normally metastasize?
the peak incidence of metastases is within 10 years of the original diagnosis. however breast cancer may be evident elsewhere in the body as early as at the time of the original diagnosis or it can be found as late as 20+ years after the cancer is first diagnosed. of course many breast cancers are cured at the time of initial treatment and never metastasize.
how exactly does herceptin (trastuzumab) work?
herceptin (trastuzumab) is a "monoclonal antibody". it is a protein that binds to receptors on breast cancer cells called her-2. her-2 causes breast cancer cells to grow uncontrollably. when herceptin (trastuzumab) binds to these cells it slows their growth. however not all breast cancer cells contain the her-2 receptors. patients must be tested for the presence of her-2 receptors before they are started on herceptin (trastuzumab).
how does breast feeding lower the risk of breast cancer?
no one knows for sure. one theory is that breast feeding makes the cells in the breast do what they are meant to do-- make breast milk. cancers often arise from cells in our body that haven't matured fully. the hormones your body produces when breast feeding force breast cells to "grow up" making them less likely to become a cancer later on.
how does breast feeding lower the risk of breast cancer?
estrogen fuels majority of breast cancers. breast feeding lowers estrogen exposure and can reduce risk of breast cancer.
how long do people usually live with breast cancer before they die?
this depends on the health of the patient before the diagnosis and also the stage of the disease.
how long do people usually live with breast cancer before they die?
the reality is that more than half of all women diagnosed with breast cancer will not die from breast cancer. while it is impossible to predict the time of cancer recurrence the stage of the cancer can help guide treatment recommendations and predict the probability of cancer recurrence. however even if cancer recurs it may be sensitive to medication that can prolong survival for years.
is the rash for inflammatory breast cancer always red?
inflammatory breast cancer is a rare but aggressive form of breast cancer which may give the appearance of a breast infection. cancer cells block the lymphatics in the skin of the breast leading to signs that mimic infection: breast redness swelling heaviness pain and/or thickening of the skin that may resemble the appearance of the surface of an orange.
is the rash for inflammatory breast cancer always red?
sometimes the skin involvement looks pink or even a little yellow. in people with dark skin the skin can sometimes just look a little darker.
is it actually true that big breast is associated with higher chance of breast cancer?
breast size does not correlate with breast cancer risks but obesity can be a breast cancer risk.
i have 2 peasize swollen lymph nodes been under armpit for 6 months. no pain/itch. im 24 and not married would there be a chance for breast cancer?
your entire axillary area you will have 20 times more lymph glands than 2 any inflammation in upper arm chest breast will result in enlarged lymph nodes besides tumors pea size is not big in thin people they can be feel normally don't worry go and see your doctor.
i have 2 peasize swollen lymph nodes been under armpit for 6 months. no pain/itch. im 24 and not married would there be a chance for breast cancer?
it would be a good idea to be evaluated by your family doctor or surgeon. most lymphadenopathy in young people is related to reactive benign cause like infection tattoos dermatitis or medications like dilantin. breast cancer is rare at your age but not unheard of especially if there is a family history. hodgkin lymphoma is also a consideration in young women.
is there cardiac failure risk involved in breast cancer chemotherapy?
chemotherapy may affect heart function for that reason a nuclear study of the heart is done before starting some type of chemotherapy for breast cancer.
is there cardiac failure risk involved in breast cancer chemotherapy?
it depends on the chemo. if there is a risk then a baseline exam is done to measure cardiac function then after chemo is started the exam is repeated at intervals to monitor any possible effect on ejection fraction/ cardiac function.
if given a bilat oopherectomy and aromatose inhibitors for breast cancer would the doctor know that these can cause osteoporosis & what should she do?
it sounds like you are aware of the risk so tell your doctor! it is great that you are thinking about this. yes you are at risk for losing bone so you need to know 1. where you are starting (what your bone density is now) 2. your vitamin d level and 3. how much your bone density changes in 1-2 years. keep up weight-bearing exercise like walking and keep up the conversation with your doc!
if given a bilat oopherectomy and aromatose inhibitors for breast cancer would the doctor know that these can cause osteoporosis & what should she do?
you are at risk for bone loss and need to have biannual bone density scans to monitor it. depending on this you may need vitamin d and calcium supplements and maybe even bisphosphonates like boniva (ibandronate) or fosamax. i'm sure your oncologist would know.
if given a bilat oopherectomy and aromatose inhibitors for breast cancer would the doctor know that these can cause osteoporosis & what should she do?
most drs know about this however sometimes there are not too many choices. best to minimize the side effects take 800mcg folic acid+ vit d3 1000 iu once a day. take also whole milk cheese low salt 4 day/ week for brakfast + add no salt butter to cooking with low heath( has vit k2).
if i don't breastfeed then does that mean i will get mastitis? how do i stop the milk flow if i am not breastfeeding?
i would highly encourage you to breast feed: baby's stronger immune system less sickness. it also adds to your own breast cancer risk reduction in addition to baby weight loss!
is complementary nature cure okay for breast cancer?
breast cancer most often requires multiple modalities of treatment including surgery radiation chemotherapy or hormone therapy. complementary treatments can help patients deal with the treatments better and some may argue they can improve the odds of surviving cancer but they should not substitute standard treatments.
is complementary nature cure okay for breast cancer?
surgery is the primary treatment for breast cancer. radiation is added with all lumpectomies typically. chemotherapy is necessary in most of the patients i care for at this point.
if bone meds and supps were given after oopherectomy and aromatose treatment for breast cancer would it delay the progression of osteoporosis?
exercise and diet are also important; dexa scan should be monitored.
if bone meds and supps were given after oopherectomy and aromatose treatment for breast cancer would it delay the progression of osteoporosis?
osteoporosis due to aromatase inhibitors can be avoided by calcium vitamin d and bone strengthening agents.
if my mother had breast cancer at 53 does that mean that i'll get it too? my brca was negative and my breasts next panel(tp 53 atm stk11 etc. ) was negative as well.
remember we don't know all about genes and cancer (will we ever? ) so as good as a negative gene panel sounds you cannot totally rule out an inherited component. if i was counseling you i would need a full family history and some personal information to estimate your risk as best as humanly possible and see how best to reduce your risk. it's all about odds dear cancer is not a certainty 4 u.
if my mother had breast cancer at 53 does that mean that i'll get it too? my brca was negative and my breasts next panel(tp 53 atm stk11 etc. ) was negative as well.
you have a family history which raises your risk. if moms genetics is negative the only way you could be (+) is if dad has gene. but it does not mean you are not at some elevated risk.
if my mother had breast cancer at 53 does that mean that i'll get it too? my brca was negative and my breasts next panel(tp 53 atm stk11 etc. ) was negative as well.
that is a good news. your work up will put you back in the general population vs high risk population but it will not eliminate your chance of having a breast cancer. so like every woman in usa you should do self-examination monthly or bi-monthly. if you're still having your period a yearly mammogram. and a physician examination yearly one out of eight woman in usa will get breast cancer.
if my mother had breast cancer at 53 does that mean that i'll get it too? my brca was negative and my breasts next panel(tp 53 atm stk11 etc. ) was negative as well.
you are at higher risk because of your mom. but there are things you can do to decrease your risk including taking certain medications (tamoxifen) later if your personal risk of breast cancer is high enough. you're young so for now stay fit exercise be moderate with alcohol (less than 4 drinks per week) and keep your weight down. ask your doctor about taking tamoxifen in the future.
it is said that tibolone is safe on breast cancer. how true is this? and does it really increase weight drastically as i heard?
tibolone is a synthetic estrogen used to treat post-menopausal symptoms like hot flashes and vaginal bleeding. it is not safe for women who have had breast cancer. a trial of more than 3000 women was stopped due to increases in cancer recurrence. it's not as well-understood as standard estrogen-progestin drugs; it doesn't work as well for symptoms and it may have higher risks. weight? i'm not sure.
it is said that tibolone is safe on breast cancer. how true is this? and does it really increase weight drastically as i heard?
synthetic steroid has benefits of all three androgenic progesterone estrogen effects reduces the incidence of invasive breast cancer protects bone prevent osteoporosis and post menopausal symptoms. it has higher incidence of strokes weight gain could be controlled by diet and exercise.
i rub my armpit with lemon. if we rub it on the armpit does this lead to breast cancer or any other disease?
i do not see why this would affect the incidence of breast cancer and is not likely to be a causative factor.
i'm just wondering if you rub lemon on the armpit does this lead to breast cancer or any other disease?
there is no evidence available to suggest that applying lemon juice to your armpit can cause breast cancer (or any other form of cancer).
is it necesary that a mastectomy or quadrantectomy be required after complete pathological response to breast cancer?
we have never been able to prove that leaving breast cancer in place after chemo or hormone treatment alone with complete path response is safe. we could shrink to perform breast conserving surgery but at times mastectomy may be indicated. we look forward to a trial that is looking at radiation vs not in complete responders who present with more advanced breast cancer.
is it necesary that a mastectomy or quadrantectomy be required after complete pathological response to breast cancer?
the problem is you will not know it is a complete pathological response until the area is removed proving that there was no microscopic cancer left. theoretically if we somehow knew it was a complete pathological response prior to surgery then maybe it would not be necessary but that is not possible at this time without surgery.
is gynecomastia harmful?
i presume that you are inquiring if there are dangers associated with enlarged breasts in males. the answer is rarely yes as breast cancer is a remote possibility. usually though the younger male with enlarged breasts is commonly plagued by psychosocial issues & possibly sensitivity of nipples & pain in the breast in a few. if medical issues are ruled out then surgical correction is the treatment.
i'm getting a breast enlargement and my physiatrist told me that i will be at higher risk for cancer. is this true?
understand annual or regular breast cancer screening imaging may also include ultrasound or mri. tomosynthesis & pet-mammo may also play minor role as secondary supplemental steps in certain cases. data suggest breast augmentation may "hide" (not cause) cancer until larger but that shouldn't happen with the above tech & educated person & physician team.
i have to make a decision on whether to have my ovaries removed during a hysterectomy and do not know what to do. my mom died of breast cancer.
some gene mutations (brca1 and brca2) that run in the family increase risk of breast and ovarian cancer significantly (lifetime risk of breast cancer 50-85% and ovarian cancer 10-40%). in these individuals oophorectomy is recommended by age 35-40 after childbearing is complete. ashkenazi jewish women are at increased risk for these mutations. discuss with your doctor if you need to get tested.
i have to make a decision on whether to have my ovaries removed during a hysterectomy and do not know what to do. my mom died of breast cancer.
i assume the hysterectomy is for benign disease. on this basis leaving the ovaries behind is to maintain the estrogen they are secreting. at 50 years of age your ovaries are loosing activity placing you into menopause so that there will be no estrogen secretion and therefore no ovarian function. on this basis it is easier to do the hysterectomy along with the ovaries and use vaginal estrogen.
i have to make a decision on whether to have my ovaries removed during a hysterectomy and do not know what to do. my mom died of breast cancer.
problems like these can only be correctly handled by your doctor in person.
i'm 41 years old with a family history of breast cancer. thereis an area of questionable architectural distortion in the outer mid left breast. what should i do?
consult with a surgeon who does breast surgery to see if you need to have a biopsy of this area. it is difficult to tell here but it is always better to be safe.
i'm 41 years old with a family history of breast cancer. thereis an area of questionable architectural distortion in the outer mid left breast. what should i do?
workup which will likely include more mammography (assuming only screening mammogram so far) breast ultrasound and depending on the findings involvement of a breast surgeon for a history and detailed physical examination. further workup may include breast mri and/or breast biopsy in order to make an accurate diagnosis.
i'm 41 years old with a family history of breast cancer. thereis an area of questionable architectural distortion in the outer mid left breast. what should i do?
see a surgeon who does a high volume of breast surgery. you need a complete physical breast examination and history. based on that you may get additional studies including focused ultrasound and / or breast mri and possibly an image-guided biopsy using one of those modalities. alternately if everything checks out fine you may just be advised to have close follow up.
i'm 41 years old with a family history of breast cancer. thereis an area of questionable architectural distortion in the outer mid left breast. what should i do?
they should have called you back for additional images. this would start with specialized mammogram views then possibly an ultrasound. if that still does not solve the question a breast mri may also be needed.
increase nodular density mammo shows benign. repeat 6 month with ultrsound. i have dense breasts worried about breast cancer. what can i do?
what is true: mammogram was not completely normal (ncreased density). you need additional testing to try to determine the cause and significance of the finding. if a new finding first step would be spot mammograms and an ultrasound of the area not waiting 6 months. mri may also be helpful but a biopsy may eventually be necessary to look at the cells under a microscope and make the diagnosis.
increase nodular density mammo shows benign. repeat 6 month with ultrsound. i have dense breasts worried about breast cancer. what can i do?
examinations mammograms are reasonable. if positive family history positive genetic testing discuss with breast surgeon.
increase nodular density mammo shows benign. repeat 6 month with ultrsound. i have dense breasts worried about breast cancer. what can i do?
there should have been an ultrasound done at the time of the follow-up mammogram. if not that should be done now. if something was seen on the mammogram it needs to be worked up with additional mammo images a sonogram and sometimes even a breast mri study.
i have asymptomatic microhematuria. urologist ordered ct scan with contrast. what might he expect to find (if anything). (history of breast cancer)?
is the detection of renal cancer. other things sought for include stones evidence of infection and less likely entities such as papillary necrosis arteriovenous malformations renal artery aneurysms and renal vein thrombosis. the bladder will also be imaged but cystoscopy is much better for looking for bladder concerns.
i have asymptomatic microhematuria. urologist ordered ct scan with contrast. what might he expect to find (if anything). (history of breast cancer)?
may be small kidney stones of a kidney tumor or just nothing since micro-hematuria is common and sometimes results from leaky tubules that filter blood in the kidneys.
i had breast cancer in 2010 and recently 3 brain tumors. did the necessary treatments ( surgery gamma knife. i would like to know if i am considered disabled because of the remaining life span?
disability is not usually judged by a person's life expectancy but rather upon loss of particular functions such as ability to walk or speak or hear etc. one can at a given time be suffering from a fatal disease with a limited life expectancy but not be disabled at least at that point in time.
i had breast cancer in 2010 and recently 3 brain tumors. did the necessary treatments ( surgery gamma knife. i would like to know if i am considered disabled because of the remaining life span?
once your cancer has spread to stage-4 it is not curable(in general). this means you are disabled for all practical purposes. your oncologist can so state if you request it.
how does a diagnostic mammogram differ from a screening mammogram?
a diagnostic mammogram is ordered when there is a specific problem with the breast. either you or your primary care provider may have felt a lump or you are called back from a screening mammogram. a screening mammogram should be done once yearly starting at age 40. these are performed in asymptomatic females to detect early signs of breast cancer.
how could i know if the lumps are just fibricystic breast changes or something more serious like breast cancer?
a lump needs to be evaluated. see your doctor.
how could i know if the lumps are just fibricystic breast changes or something more serious like breast cancer?
a simple biopsy would give you your answer if the lesions are suspicious on imaging.
how could i know if the lumps are just fibricystic breast changes or something more serious like breast cancer?
i have been a breast cancer surgeon for almost 20 years and i am still fooled by some exams. with that said there are some generalizations about which breast lumps are more concerning than others. cancers tend to be rock-hard fixed and 3-dimensionally round or oval. benign lumps tend to be rubbery cigar-shaped or pancake-shaped.
how could i know if the lumps are just fibricystic breast changes or something more serious like breast cancer?
have a physical examination with your doctor mammogram and a breast ultrasound if indicated. if there is anything needing further evaluation after that then mri or breast needle biopsy may be indicated next.
how can i know if i'm at high risk of getting breast cancer?
factors include: being female increasing age genetics family history of breast cancer previous breast cancer being caucasian dense breast tissue some previous benign breast conditions never having given birth or 1st child after age 30 early menarche late menopause radiation (chest) exposure to diethylstilbestrol hormone replacement after menopause oral contraceptives obesity
how can i know if i'm at high risk of getting breast cancer?
there are specialists who will evaluate you risk recommend screening and advise you how to reduce such risk. they will also determine if you need genetic testing. ask your family doc or gyn about this.
how can i know if i'm at high risk of getting breast cancer?
if you have a first degree relative(mother sister daughter) with breast cancer dx before age 50 if there are 2 relatives affected use of estrogen for more than 8 years dense breast tissue.
how can i know if i'm at high risk of getting breast cancer?
speak with a genetic counselor.
how can i know if i'm at high risk of getting breast cancer?
discuss with your doctor your family history lifestyle etc. also discuss available tests to determine your genetic risk.
how old should a woman be to start getting mammograms? i've heard several different ages.
mammograms are recommended for woman age 50 and over. however if you have a family history of breast cancer talk to your health care provider about early detection and starting mammograms sooner.
how long should a patient wait before starting chemotherapy and after the breast cancer surgery?
studies have shown that benefit from chemotherapy doesn't begin to drop off as long as it is started within 12 weeks of surgery. i take the type of cancer into consideration though. for more aggressive breast cancers i like to start chemo within 4-6 weeks. for the slower growing er+ cancers within 12 weeks is fine and supported by data.
how long should a patient wait before starting chemotherapy and after the breast cancer surgery?
in general chemotherapy is started 4 weeks after surgery ofcourse if surgical wound is well healed and there are no signs of infection. again in general no longer than 8 weeks. each case is different talk to your oncologist.
how long should a patient wait before starting chemotherapy and after the breast cancer surgery?
the best answer is "as soon as possible" since there is no benefit to waiting (other than allowing a few weeks to recover from surgery). many clinical trials require that chemotherapy be started within 6 weeks of surgery but this too is arbitrary. i suggest that you talk to your medical oncologist and ask him/her what is best for you.
how long should a patient wait before starting chemotherapy and after the breast cancer surgery?
it depends on the type of breast cancer but for most breast cancers studies show that chemotherapy should be started by 12 weeks after surgery. after 12 weeks the benefit from chemo starts to drop off. if your cancer is more aggressive (triple negative er negative) you should probably start sooner ie within 4-6 weeks.
how can a patient still have cancer after lumpectomy? cant find good surgeon (even if rich celebrities)? not fair to need mastectomy vs radiation etc
it's not the surgeon it's the bad breast neighborhood that allows cancer to return. cancer cells can sneak away from the tumor before surgery which is why radiation therapy is necessary after any lumpectomy. even with radiation there is a higher chance of cancer returning after a lumpectomy compared to mastectomy. you're right it's not fair. we need better treatments for breast cancer.
how can a patient still have cancer after lumpectomy? cant find good surgeon (even if rich celebrities)? not fair to need mastectomy vs radiation etc
many well-designed studies have proven that lumpectomy alone is insufficient local rx of breast cancer due to high rates of local recurrence; radiation therapy (rt) to the breast is necessary to reduce this rate to acceptable levels. unfortunately some people are not candidates for rt in which case mastectomy is necessary. second opinions are often very helpful to clarify these issues.
how can a patient still have cancer after lumpectomy? cant find good surgeon (even if rich celebrities)? not fair to need mastectomy vs radiation etc
an expert physician in breast cancer is necessary to give the statistics necessary to decide on a lumpectomy. a good expert gives the positives and negatives of a treatment likelihood of a recurrence. not all surgeons are equal in their ability to treat breast cancer. always get a second or even a third opinion. educate yourself have a family member become a great source of info for you--read.
how safe is brevail a supplement for breast health. i am 56 years old going through menopause am cancer free now but had a lumpectomy 3 years ago.?
brevail is a dietary supplement that contains lignans which are estrogen-like compounds found in plants. most studies of lignans in post-menopausal women have been too short to determine if they're safe fo women who have had breast cancer. some studies show that they help reduce the severity of hot flashes but other studies show no effect. talk to your doctor about other alternatives to hormones.
how safe is brevail a supplement for breast health. i am 56 years old going through menopause am cancer free now but had a lumpectomy 3 years ago.?
the active ingredient in brevail should not cause harm. remember no studies in humans have demonstrated any benefit in preventing breast cancer and you should discuss this with your doctor.
how many new cases of breast cancer happen in the united states in a year?
the american cancer society's most recent estimates for breast cancer in the united states are for 2012: about 226 870 new cases of invasive breast cancer will be diagnosed in women. about 63 300 new cases of carcinoma in situ (cis) will be diagnosed (cis is non-invasive and is the earliest form of breast cancer). about 39 510 women will die from breast cancer.
how common is it for someone to need a radical mastectomy?
radical mastectomy involves removing the breast adjacent nodes node dissection in the armpit pectoralis muscle and enveloping membranes. it is disfiguring painful and rarely needed. on if you have neglected obvious signs of breast cancer would this be considered. muscle sparing mastectomy is more common as is lumpectomy.
how common is it for someone to need a breast augmentation or enlargement?
breast augmentation surgery is done for cosmetic enhancement in most cases. the exceptions are those who have had mastectomy for breast cancer and the rare individual with significant disparity in the size of the two breasts. otherwise it is a matter of personal cosmetic feeling and not a medical decision.
how do you define male breast cancer?
histologically the same as female breast cancer and presents the same way eg with a lump albeit usually at a more advanced stage. imaging work up is also similar with mammography and sonography the initial modalities of choice.
how do you define male breast cancer?
mbc (male breast cancer) is breast cancer in a man. men can get breast cancer jsut like women. they have breast tissue as well. men are at much lower risk for this type of cacner but it can happen.
how do you define male breast cancer?
develops a lump or assymmetry of breast/pectoral tissue. adolescemt boys commonly get gynecomastia during puberty that may embarrass them but has no clinical import. adult men develop duct cancer just like women but much much less frequently but it can be as lethal or curable as women. all men have remnants/precursors of true breast tissue. find a lump seek a cause and answer from your doc.
had holiday gathering with multiple family members and found out that many had metastatic breast cancer. what can i do to prevent it?
yes i agree with dr turrisi and zafar. talk to your family members who have breast cancer. they would need to have genetic counselling and genetic testing - to see if they carry the brca 1/2 gene mutation etc. if they carry this gene mutation then you should ask the counsellor what your risk is and then you would probably need to get the test as well. you need prevention if your test is +.
had holiday gathering with multiple family members and found out that many had metastatic breast cancer. what can i do to prevent it?
counseling. there are two known genes (brca-1 & -2) that run in families and there are other familial clusters without ientified molecular/genetic signatures. not every hospital has this but nci designanted cancer centers usually do. the tests are blood tests for the family and counseling about impact. they will pedigree the family and find patterns and explore.
had holiday gathering with multiple family members and found out that many had metastatic breast cancer. what can i do to prevent it?
have genetic test done. also have your mammogram done and check with your doctor if u will qualify for preventive medications for breast cancer like evista (raloxifene) tamoxifen and aromatase inhibitors. usually an oncologist assess the risk of developing breast cancer depending on different risk factors and facts about patient histories
how can young women find breast cancers early if mammograms aren't done until they are older?
breast cancer is rare in young women but not impossible. it is good to be comfortable knowing what are normal "lumps and bumps" for you and how your breast change during your menstural cycle. if you notice a lump that is new or diffferent or any nipple bleeding or discharge bring it to your dr. 's attention asap. most woment find their own masses. be comfortable performing a breast self exam.
how can young women find breast cancers early if mammograms aren't done until they are older?
thankfully breast cancer is rare in young women which explains why we begin screening at 40. although controversial i am a proponent of self-examination and have cared for many women who have found their own cancers. if you have a strong family history of breast cancer we begin mammography 10 years before your relative was diagnosed. an mri can be very helpful in young women with dense breasts.
how can young women find breast cancers early if mammograms aren't done until they are older?
exam. knowing your body (breasts for women; testes for men) is the first defense. mamograms at young age deliver radiation more likely to cause problems than find them. mammos rarely find the 15% of cancers called lobular carcinoma. examine yourself during all phases of menstrual cycle to see normal variations. call your doc if you find a change.
how likely is man to get breast cancer?
male breast cancer is much more rare than in women. the chance is listed on a cancer site as 0. 1% lifetime risk in men and only account for 1% of all breast cancers.
how likely is man to get breast cancer?
the life time risk for a man for breast cancer is about 0. 1% compared to 13% for women.
how likely is man to get breast cancer?
male breast cancer is very rare.
how to boost white blood counts during chemotherapy for breast cancer?
your oncologist can use bone marrow growth factors ("gcsf") to stimulate production of white blood cells. these drugs developed and tested in the 1980's became available in the ~spring of 1991 and (along with drugs to treat/prevent nausea) completely changed the field of oncology. it went from being a mostly inpatient discipline to one almost entirely practiced in the outpatient setting.
how to boost white blood counts during chemotherapy for breast cancer?
if your blood counts are severely low then use of growth factor injections(neulasta (pegfilgrastim) or neupogen) can help boost the recovery of your blood counts after chemotherapy.
how to boost white blood counts during chemotherapy for breast cancer?
there are medications to increase the white and red blood cell counts if they are affected by chemotherapy. your oncologist can discuss them with you. there are specific guidelines for their use.
how does breast cancer affect women's quality of life?
early on the greatest impact on qol is related to the emotional effects of a cancer dx and the physical effects of surgery+/-chemo+/-radiation rx. thankfully most women return to their normal pre-dx state soon after although the fear of cancer recurrence can be overwhelming for some. ironically some people's lives improve as they prioritize their health & what's most important in their lives.
how does breast cancer affect women's quality of life?
cancer of breast is devastating to the woman better hope every day due to early diagnosis availability and use of better medication better understanding of the disease. yet quality of life depends on patient's out look accepting the information given and support she receives from family and friends.
how young can you be to get breast cancer if male?
breast cancer is very rare in men and is rarely present prior to age 40. regardless of one's age and gender it is always best to see a doctor if one finds a new breast lump.
how young can you be to get breast cancer if male?
most cases of male breast cancer are detected in men between the ages of 60 and 70 although the condition can develop in men of any age. i have seen a case in a patient in their 20's.
how have the treatments for breast cancer changed from the past 20 years?
chemo: molecular staging leading to more precise targeted therapy; new drugs such as herceptin (trastuzumab) and aromatase inhibitors. surgery: increased breast conserving rx sentinel ln biopsy oncoplastic surgery nipple-sparing mastectomy. radiation therapy: partial breast irradiation (brachytherapy intraoperative radiation therapy). prevention: brca testing. just to a name a few.
how have the treatments for breast cancer changed from the past 20 years?
breast conservation was proven to be equivalent to mastectomy and that evidence holds strongly today. use of sentinel node and now limiting node dissetion is new. knowledge of brca her-2-neu trastuzumab (herceptin) are since then. some women now opt for bilateral mastectomy (+/- reconstruction) despite no change in mortality has currency. chemo with taxanes and neoadjuvant approaches newer.
how to tell if it's a breast cancer or other lump?
it often requires a biopsy needle or open or fine needle aspirate to differentiate a benign lump from cancer. please consult your doctor.
how to tell if it's a breast cancer or other lump?
other than a biopsy of the lump there is no guaranteed way of telling is something is a cancer or not. mammogram ultrasound or breast mri may indicate the lump has a higher risk of cancer because of shape calcifications within the lump or reaction around it but none of those are a sure way to diagnose it. biopsy is still the only way to really diagnose it.
how to tell if it's a breast cancer or other lump?
with mammogram and ultrasound.
how to tell if it's a breast cancer or other lump?
it is very difficult to distinguish a benign breast lump from a cancer for patient and doctor. depending upon age and physical examination findings we will often get a mammogram and ultrasound to help evaluate a breast lump sometimes culminating in a (nonsurgical) needle-biopsy--ultimately the only way to be 100% certain is to look at the tissue under the microscope.
hard and solid lump under my right nipple. is this breast cancer?
absolutely it is possible to be a cancer. need to see your doctor. you doctor can examine the lump-and further tests would need to be done accordingly that would include- mammogram/sonogram and biopsy of the lump. please see your doctor immediately.
hard and solid lump under my right nipple. is this breast cancer?
any lump in the breast needs to be investigated asap. results for early breast cancer are generally good. see your doctor asap.
hard and solid lump under my right nipple. is this breast cancer?
any lump of breast in adult breast including male ( 1% of breast cancers are in men ) should be considered as malignant lesion unless proved other wise you must see your family doctor doctor if needed will refer to a specialist.
how often should i receive a mammogram i am 29 years old. i have had a knot in my right breast since 2007 my dr says it is caused of caffine but it gets sore sometimes the first knot i had i had it removed it came back non cancer and no cancer cells wher
mammograms remain our best test to screen for breast cancer. most us experts advise starting at 40 (or 10 yrs younger than a close family member who had breast ca). the lump you describe sounds classic for fibrocystic changes: "lumpy-bumpy" breast tissue that is sensitive to hormonal changes. if you find a new lump it is always best to see your gyne or primary care dr. to be extra-cautious.

the "knot" you described in your breast sounds like a cyst which can increase in size if you consume a lot of caffeine. these cysts often tend to hurt right before your period. as far as breast cancer screening goes for women who have a first degree relative (your mother in this case) with breast cancer then screening for them would start ten years before the age your mother was when she was diagnosed. for instance if your mother was diagnosed at age 40 your screening would start at age 30. if your doctor is not following this protocol then you should seek another opinion. all the best.
how to tell if it's a breast cancer lump or some sort of other lump?
you need a clinical breat exam and either mammogram or ultrasound maybe both. see a doctor/clinic.
how to tell if it's a breast cancer lump or some sort of other lump?
an experienced physician can often differentiate the lumpy-bumpy normal tissue from suspicious masses. their exam combined with your medical history will guide them to ordering additional imaging and possible biopsy.
how to tell if it's a breast cancer lump or some sort of other lump?
the only sure way is to have the lump removed and the tissue examined by a pathologist.
how’s an aromatase inhibitor used for breast cancer?
aromatase inhibitors are a form of hormonal therapy for post menopausal patients. they are effective only in er+ cases. they block the conversion of other hormones to estrogen via the enzyme aromatase. in premenopausal patients they actually stimulate the ovaries to increase estrogen production. hormonal therapy is systemic treatment reduces local recurrence and reduces risk of 2nd primaries.
how’s an aromatase inhibitor used for breast cancer?
estrogen used in women after menopause with tumors that have an estrogen receptor. it is not useful if eh ovaries are generating scads of estrogen. and tumors without er do not respond to estrogen maneuvers. it also may be useful as a preventive in older women with in situ cancers but tamoxifen is standard.
how to tell if it's breast cancer in a lump?
the only way to know for sure if a breast lump is cancer or not is with a biopsy - a procedure in which a small amount of the lump is removed and then examined by a pathologist under the microscope. mammogram ultrasound and mri can give a good idea if a lump is cancer or not and depending on the results of imaging studies biopsy may not be necessary.
how to tell if it's breast cancer in a lump?
if there's a new lump that's drawing attention/concern seek immediate medical attention and referral to a breast surgeon. beyond clinical impression imaging will often suggest what the lesion is but the most definitive diagnosis usually comes via a needle (i. e aspiration or core biopsy).
how to tell if it's breast cancer in a lump?
the lump should be biopsied or removed and the tissue examined by a pathologist to arrive at the correct diagnosis.
i know that massaging pomegranate seed oil into my breast would prevent breast cancer would eating pomegranate also help prevent it?
some interesting work is going on in the last few years about pomegranate -- including with breast lung colon prostate and some other cancers. here's a review even though technical: <link> the breast ca work is in vitro not in live people though: <link> this means it's very preliminary -- yet companies may claim it to sell their products. be well.
i know that massaging pomegranate seed oil into my breast would prevent breast cancer would eating pomegranate also help prevent it?
people want to believe in easy answers to serious problems. a crook makes something up publishes it on their internet site pretends to be a persecuted humanitarian offering natural healing and proceeds to make money off of puzzled people who will buy seeds "just to be safe". unlike these folks your physician is obligated by law to tell the truth. i'm sorry you were deceived.
i know that massaging pomegranate seed oil into my breast would prevent breast cancer would eating pomegranate also help prevent it?
you may be 'aware' that massaging pomegranate seed into your breasts would prevent breast cancer but as a physician/pathologist i am not; indeed i am aware of no scientific evidence to support this notion. i doubt you can eat enough pomegranates to do anything to prevent breast cancer either. talk to your physician and don't get your medical advice from unreliable sources.
is one month of breast pain a sign of breast cancer?
a particular or focal area of pain should be investigated with mammogram and/or sonogram but breast pain all over is usually fibrocystic/hormonal pain. breast cancer is usually a painless hard non-movable lump. anytime you are concerned about changes in your breast consult your doctor to see if additional testing is needed.
is removing a breast tumor dangerous?
all surgery has some risk but in general breast cancer surgery is very safe. it is certainly much safer than not having such surgery when there is a diagnosis of suspected or proven cancer. risks include bad reactions to anesthesia and infection but both of these are very rare. thousands of such operations are done without complications every year.
i'm just wondering if you have cancer running in the family is it good to get a boob job?
two or more first degree relatives with breast cancer i would not recommend an augmentation.
i'm just wondering if you have cancer running in the family is it good to get a boob job?
i am not sure that this has every been studied specifically for men but one danish study showed that female breast reductions did lower the incidence of breast cancer. whether this is true in males is unknown to the best of my knowledge.
in what ways are breast cancer and ovarian cancer associated with each other?
the genetic mutation brca 1& 2 link them molecularly such that risk exceeds 80% and warrant oophorectomy before cancer dx. since many breast cancers are fueled by estrogen oophorectomy may diminish overt breast cancer.
i have a lump about 1. 5 cm in diameter. what is the likelihood of it being breast cancer?
the lump should be checked by your physician. ultrasounds mammograms and mri's can help to define if it's benign or cancer. a sample of the lump to examine under the microscope would give the final answer.
i'm just wondering if you opt out for chemotherapy for breast cancer what is the process you go through?
out' means 'refuse' or 'decide to stop'. either is a serious decision that requires discussion with 1 or more medical oncologists. the 'oncotype' process defines benefit and risk of chemo in some. however depending on many factors (size nodal status receptors) the consequences vary. perfect for second or third opinion.
is it unusual for a 14 year old to have symptoms of breast cancer?
but not impossible. the youngest person in the u. s. to be diagnosed was a 10 yr old girl. she presented with an itch of her breast and her mom noticed the lump. <link> bottom line get checked by your doctor if you are concerned!
i was diagnosed with breast cancer that has spread to 2 lymph nodes my app't with a surgeon is aug12 is that too long a wait. can it spread?
you should be okay waiting until august 12th although it is hard to know for sure without any more information.
i was diagnosed with breast cancer that has spread to 2 lymph nodes my app't with a surgeon is aug12 is that too long a wait. can it spread?
it is ok to wait a bit read do some research maybe mri of the breasts depending on your age pet/ct scan for staging second opinion before surgery. take advantage of that wait period to do all that read american cancer society and susan komen foundation websites.
i was diagnosed with breast cancer that has spread to 2 lymph nodes my app't with a surgeon is aug12 is that too long a wait. can it spread?
while theoretically you could say yes the data we have on getting treatment in that short of an interval has no effect on survival or tumor spread. your outcome should be the same as if all your treatment began today. in addition your tumor has already moved to the lymph nodes so it has already spread beyond the breast.
is it possible to develop breast cancer at 17?
but not impossible. the youngest person in the u. s. to be diagnosed was a 10 yr old girl. she presented with an itch of her breast and her mom noticed the lump. <link> bottom line get teen checked by doctor if you are concerned!
if you have breast cancer and found the lump what would it feel like?
some times hard sometimes rubbery sometimes can't feel at all. best way to know what it is: get examined by your md. may need mammogram and/or ultrasound to figure it out. there are educational models some doctors keep in their office that have a 'cancer' nodule in a fake breast so you can feel what it may be like when you check yourself.
is it possible to develop breast cancer at sixteen?
but still possible. have her doctor take a look at it.
i have a small bump on my chest i'm 18 but worried if i can have breast cancer. is it possible?
it is unlikely but not impossible to have breast cancer at 18. if you have a family history of breast cancer or breast cancer has been diagnosed in a premenopausal family member it can develop in younger generations of the same family. an ultrasound +/- biopsy can alleviate your concern.
i have symptoms of inflammatory breast cancer but there is a 3 week waiting time for a gp appointment. what should i do?
you must be more persistent. you are your own best medical advocate. call and insist to be seen if you must - if you're wrong no problem. if you're right treatments will start almost immediately. good luck.
is radiation treatment always necessary for breast cancer?
every pt has the choice of mastectomy or breast conserving treatment. some time after mastectomy radiation is added if we are worried the ca might have a high risk of coming back. breast conserving tx is a minimal surgery followed by radiation. this allows the pt to keep their breast and hasa the same recurrence rate as a mastectomy.
is radiation treatment always necessary for breast cancer?
the decisions regarding adjunctive therapy (radiation chemo and hormonal ) are dependent on each individual case. discuss this with your surgeon and oncologist. good luck.
is it possible to have breast cancer for ten years without knowing?
i guess a very tiny breast cancer could initially go undetected and grow over a 10 year time period into a larger mass that is then able to be felt on a physical examination.
it could be possible that a boob job affect the chances of developing breast cancer?
breast implants are not related to breast cancer risk. they have not been shown to increase the rate of breast cancer.
it could be possible that a boob job affect the chances of developing breast cancer?
getting breast implants does not increase your chances of getting breast cancer as has been shown by multiple large clinical trials. one of the factors though in developing breast cancer is breast size i. e. larger natural breast size will have higher risk of breast cancer that is why in men the incidence of breast cancer is lower as they have lower initial breast tissue volume.
is it possible to develop breast cancer at thirteen?
very unlikely. can get a fibroma but not cancer.
is it possible to develop breast cancer at thirteen?
it would be extremely unlikely for this to happen.
is breast cancer's only sign of existence is that make one fool-proof to breast cancer mortality and reduction of life-span?
breast a treatable disease if diagnosed early that is why mammography recommended.
is it okay that my nipple is inward after a breast reduction?
inverted nipples after breast reduction can happen. it usually resolves after time. check with your surgeon to see if there is something that can be done to correct the inversion. how long ago was the breast reduction? . if the inversion is recent and a long time after the reduction you should see your doctor to do a breast exam. a breast cancer can cause the nipple to become inverted.
is breast cancer that was treated 3 years ago but just found to show up again as spinal cancer considered terminal?
this would depend on where the breast cancer appeared in the spine. most often these occur as metastases to the vertebra of the spine. these may be treated very effectively with surgery and radiation with very good local control. the status of the breast cancer in the rest of the body (ie. are there other metastatic sites? ) is the key to the overall prognosis. also molecular markers are important.
i had t-cell lymphoma 3 times about 10 to 7 years ago then breast cancer did chemo and radi. and now i have cracks in teeth is this normal?
yes chemotherapy & radiotherapy will cause short term and long term damage to teeth along with gums. yours could be long ted effects causing cracks including loss of enamel. good you won the battle 4 times think it as battle scars visit your dentist to save them. good luck.
i had t-cell lymphoma 3 times about 10 to 7 years ago then breast cancer did chemo and radi. and now i have cracks in teeth is this normal?
chemo and rad can affect your saliva flow and composition in many cases. this in turn can make you more susceptible to oral infections tooth cavities gum disease and some other issues. however teeth don't crack or fracture from the oral changes related to cancer treatment. it's much more likely that something unrelated is causing that like clenching or grinding your teeth or another habit.
is there any test that can be done to know whether the chemotherapy drugs for breast cancer stage 1 are working properly?
remember that chemo given after surgery is meant to treat potentially existing microscopic deposits of cells and thus improve the odds of surviving cancer not to treat cancer that we can see and measure. for that reason only time will tell if it was successful. from now on it is time for surveillance. be alert but don't live in fear. best to you.
is there any test that can be done to know whether the chemotherapy drugs for breast cancer stage 1 are working properly?
you should go to the doctors and they can evaluate whether a treatment or drug is effective or if it is not as effective and increase or decrease dosage or change medications or change treatment plan. but you need to go to your doctor for this and nothing at home will test efficacy of chemotherapy drugs for breast cancer.
is there any test that can be done to know whether the chemotherapy drugs for breast cancer stage 1 are working properly?
your doctor will follow your progress clinically but there is no "test" per se. however it is a little unusual to need chemotherapy for stage 1 breast cancer so i presume you are using one of the herceptin-type antibody agents targeted at a specific type of cancer. the doctor will use examination and xrays - mammogram ct usually - to follow your progress.
i scheduled an appointment to get three tests done: pap smear mammogram and cholesterol testing. what can i expect?
cholesterol test is bloodwork. you will go to the blood lab for them to draw a tube of blood. mammogram is a screening test for breast cancer typically start at age 40 unless you have a problem or are at high risk. breasts are compressed in the mammogram machine and xrays taken (2 per breast usually). pap -speculum inserted into vagina and cells scraped from cervix to test for cervical cancer.
i have had svt for almost 40 years and take verapamil er 240 and atenolol 25mg. now i am scared that study found breast cancer increase!
i couldn't find the study you're referring to but you'll go crazy if you worry about media accounts of supposed links j clin onc july 1 2011 has less breast cancer in people who take beta-blockers; ann onc nov 2000 has improved survival in patients with metastatic breast cancer taking verapamil. attend to your heart and practice good breast cance surveillance & you'll be taking the right course.
is it possible to have a fibrocystic breast cyst with discharge and not be cancer when it's only in one breast?
breast cancer especially ductal cancer usually puts out a diffuse clear or bloody nipple discharge. greenish discharge is common and often unilateral with ductal ectasia and fibrocystic breasts. sometimes it will be so dark it will look almost black. even women with galacotorrhea (milk production) will sometimes only have it on one side.
i'm a strong disbeliever in mammograms due to the radiation. will a doctor still treat me if i refuse to havemammograms?
your doctor may ask you to sign a form that acknowledges that mammography was recommended but you refused the procedure. ultrasound of the breasts is not at all to be considered a screening tool for breast cancer. breast mri with contrast may be a possible alternative but is expensive. radiation risk is much lower than risk of breast cancer.
i'm a strong disbeliever in mammograms due to the radiation. will a doctor still treat me if i refuse to havemammograms?
i'm sure you know that the odds of radiation problems are less than those of missing an early breast cancer but this? is about choices. most docs will respect an informed patient's choices even if they don't agree with it. i just hope you are willing to accept the consequences of such choices. people now find it easy to make choices and then blame others. no disrespect intended.
is mucinous breast cancer linked to ovarian cancer? had mucinous b. c. in 2006. need hysterectomy due to fibroid but don't want to give up ovaries.
at 49 years old you have very little use for your ovaries. if you are going to have a hysterectomy done anyway for the bleeding from your fibroids you should seriously considering removing the fallopian tubes and the ovaries as well. they are sites for future disease.
is mucinous breast cancer linked to ovarian cancer? had mucinous b. c. in 2006. need hysterectomy due to fibroid but don't want to give up ovaries.
see if you can be typed for a possible brca gene mutation. regardless of type you got the cancer while quite young and this would make it worthwhile to learn your status. even if you do not carry the gene talk with your physician about the advantages and disadvantages of different surgical options.
is mucinous breast cancer linked to ovarian cancer? had mucinous b. c. in 2006. need hysterectomy due to fibroid but don't want to give up ovaries.
cancers are linked in the setting of brca mutations. you had breast cancer at the age of 43 so based on nccn guidelines you should be seen by a genetic counselor and be tested for at least brca and maybe other genes depending on your family history. if positive you need them out. if negative have normal looking ovaries and have no family history of ovarian cancer you could keep them. best 2u.
i am 29 years old i had my period at 11 years old so am i at greater risk of breast cancer cause of my age?
at your age you remain in the low risk category. family history smoking genetic features are what contribute most to your risk. age is a huge risk but 29 is still very young. 40 is the age where we really began to concern ourselves a little more and definitely over 50. however you can be diagnosed at your age so odd you have symptoms or concerns then yes see your doctor.
i am 29 years old i had my period at 11 years old so am i at greater risk of breast cancer cause of my age?
this question can bring about some pretty complicated answers but i will tell you the way i like to look at it. the age of your first period realistically tells us essentially nothing about your chance of getting breast cancer. unfortunately roughly 1 of every 8 women will develop breast cancer at some point in their life so it is important as you get older to have exams and screening mammograms.
is nipple discharge normal if it only happens every so often?
reasons for nipple discharge can include stimulation of the breast pregnancy medications galactorrhea (secretion of milk or similar substance) an abscess or other breast infection hormonal imbalances (like hypothyroidism) fibrocystic breasts (breasts are very fibrous) blocked mammary duct breast cancer and intraductal papilloma (non cancerous mass) use of marijuana anise and fennel.
i'm 23 and my mother has been pestering me about getting a mammogram done. is it something required at my age?
unless there is some special circumstance (i. e. a lump skin dimpling nipple inversion or strong family history of breast cancer) then 23 is too young for a mammogram. i would recommend getting a physical and use that time to ask your doctor what screening tests are recommended.
is stage 2 breast cancer bad?
all breast cancer is bad but the prognosis changes with stages. so the lowest stage has the best prognosis and the highest stage stage 4 has the worst prognosis. technically there is a stage 0 which is something called dcis which hasn't invaded out of the ducts. stage 1 is better than stage 2 but stage 2 is definitely curable. you can never know you are cured for sure so follow up is necessary.
is it possible for a 16 year old girl to have breast cancer if they have a red/bruised axillary lymph node in their left armpit?
breast cancer in teens is very rare though not impossible. there are many other causes of axillary lymphadenopathy (infection for example) other than cancer. i would see your health care provider for an examination.
is it possible for a 16 year old girl to have breast cancer if they have a red/bruised axillary lymph node in their left armpit?
it is possible to have breast cancer at age 16 although less common. you should see your doctor for examination.
is it true that if you bump ur breasts into something that may be a cause of breast cancer? thanks
trauma to the breast does not cause breast cancer.
is it true that if you bump ur breasts into something that may be a cause of breast cancer? thanks
no but you may get a bruise. you should still get your regular yearly exams with your doctor.
is it true that if you bump ur breasts into something that may be a cause of breast cancer? thanks
cause cancer but an existing cancer can be jostled and bleed and "appear" when was clinically undetectable before. cancer is a disease at the genetic level caused by dna not trauma.
is breast cancer impossible in teenagers?
breast cancer in teenagers is highly unusual but not impossible. concern of breast cancer in this decade is usually associated with a palpable lump. an ultrasound +/- needle biopsy can usually clarify the situation quickly.
is stage 3c breast cancer curable?
in theory with aggressive multi modality therapy (surgery plus chemo plus radiation +/- hormones +/- herceptin). the risk of relapse is high but you do all you can and hope for the best. if this is about you fight well and best wishes.
is stage 3c breast cancer curable?
stage 3c can be cured usually with surgery radiation and chemotherapy. there are new targeted agents that have improved this based on "targeting" the treatment to the type of breast cancer. unfortunately recurrence even in the form of metastases can occur at any time so patients need to be followed and can't really be declared "cured".
if you have inflammatory breast cancer could you have a fever?
inflammatory breast cancer can simulate an infection with pain and fever. a bad diagnosis to be sure but more often missed as an infection initially.
if you have inflammatory breast cancer could you have a fever?
a fever can be low grade due to the infiltration of white blood cells and when they are destroyed fever producing chemicals are released. (pyrogens).
if you have a fever then take antibiotics and the fever goes away but you still have a big painful lump could this be inflammatory breast cancer? my
it is too early to say. from your info it appears that you are/were being treated for a breast abscess. the antibiotics resolved the fever but the abscess mass may persist and need surgical drainage even if it is abscess.
if you have a fever then take antibiotics and the fever goes away but you still have a big painful lump could this be inflammatory breast cancer? my
inflammatory breast cancer (ibc) rarely causes a fever. usually women have a lump swelling of the breast and a red discoloration of the skin with swelling of the skin and pale lines that look like stretch marks. i agree with the previous doctors that you may have had an abscess (pocket of infection) in the breast that hasn't gone completely away. please see your doctor soon! good luck!
if you have a fever then take antibiotics and the fever goes away but you still have a big painful lump could this be inflammatory breast cancer? my
it could be an abscess in the breast although you would likely still have fever. but any mass in the breast could be cancer. not necessarily inflammatory breast cancer but any new mass in the breast needs work-up including an exam. mammogram and possibly ultrasound and maybe a biopsy.
if you have inflammatory breast cancer could you have a big appetite & feel energetic?
if a cancer has not spread or affected a vital organ significantly a patient may still feel quite well. inflammatory cancer is a serious form of breast cancer and should be dealt with promptly and aggressively. make sure you see a doc right away and if you already did make sure he/she is on top of it.
if you have inflammatory breast cancer could you have a big appetite & feel energetic?
having inflammatory breast cancer does not necessarily mean you would lose appetite or energy. it also doesn't mean the cancer has spread. but it is aggressive and needs prompt treatment. if the breast is red has dimpling is enlarged or swollen or has a mass see a doctor immediately.
how much must i expect my doctor to educate me on breast cancer screening?
the message is - dont assume and dont expect. with a lot of changing on the policies/guidelines from the medicare and health system etc etc etc- a lot of doctors really have to see a lot of patients in a very short period of time- which is just impossible. now dont expect and dont assume your doctor would educate so many things to you. if you have any question-dont hesitate to ask. just ask! .
how much must i expect my doctor to educate me on breast cancer screening?
yoi should come out with a complete plan and idea of what you do an timming. www. drlugo. com.
how accessible must my breast cancer doctor be to me?
every cancer doctor would agree that the more knowledge a patient has the better prepared to reach a cure. modern technology has enabled much greater access to knowledge both with respect to websites dedicated to cancer education and to virtual connections with their doctors. i give all my breast cancer patients my cellphone # and email address (as do many of my medical oncology colleagues).
how accessible must my breast cancer doctor be to me?
very accessible. to me this is very important. www. drlugo. com.
how can i transition from breast cancer patient to cancer survivor?
if you have survived the treatment and you are cancer free then you are a survivor. congratulations! www. drlugo. com.
how must a breast cancer doctor respond appropriately to my husband's questions?
you breast cancer doctors and nurses should take the time to answer you and your family's questions. if you are being rushed to make decisions and do not feel you are getting the answers you deserve then get a 2nd opinion. if your provider is offended by you seeking another opinion then you should change providers.
how must a breast cancer doctor respond appropriately to my husband's questions?
he should answer all questions to his and your satisfaction. www. drlugo. com.
how do they test for breast cancer in men?
same as a female. mammogram and/or ultrasound. www. drlugo. com.
how do they test for breast cancer in men?
if a man has a breast mass he gets the same work up as for women: mammogram ultrasound core needle biopsy (taking a sample) of the mass. treatment options are similar: surgery radiation chemotherapy and hormonal therapy.
how much faster do vitamins make a breast tumor grow?
vitamins don't speed up a breast tumor's growth. i can understand why you might think that's true but studies have shown it's not. some chemotherapy works by inhibiting certain vitamins (ie folate) but there is no scientific evidence showing that vitamins increase breast cancer growth.
how can you tell a normal lump under a guy's nipple vs. a symptom of male breast cancer?
you will need an exam by a health professional and an ultrasound to know for sure.
how can you tell a normal lump under a guy's nipple vs. a symptom of male breast cancer?
any lump under the nipple is abnormal and should be examined by a doctor and likely biopsied to exclude cancer.
how can you tell a normal lump under a guy's nipple vs. a symptom of male breast cancer?
skin issues common male breast unusual. it used to be exclusively older men but camp lejeune cluster in marines family and vets suggest environmental toxin. if the lump has been there and has not changed i'd worry less. if it is enlarging red and painful see a surgeon. cancer usually is not painful but it needs removal and sent to path to analyze.
how to get tested for breast cancer w/o a pain?
breast cancer does not usually present with pain. most women have a mass that is not painful. if you feel something abnormal in your breast see your physician. they will perform a clinical breast exam and then recommend the appropriate imaging (usually a mammogram or ultrasound).
how to get tested for breast cancer w/o a pain?
mamographic examination may be uncomfortable but the discomfort more than makes up for the efficacy in cancer detection.
how can you prevent breast cancer from happening?
the biggest risk is being female and getting older. other risk factors include having babies after 30 not having any babies at all menopause at a later age or hormone replacement therapy. less than10% of people who develop breast cancer have an inherited gene called the brca gene. get your mammograms yearly to detect it early when cure is highest. exercise and stay at your ideal weight.
how can you prevent breast cancer from happening?
you can't choose your parents unfortunately. you can't prevent yourself from having certain hereditary genetic mutation-that will play a role in about 20% of breast cancer incidence. but what you can do is by having a regular screening with mammogram- have a healthy lifestyle well balanced diet avoid bad habits like cigarette and alcohol. exercise regularly. and hope that we're not gonna get it.
how comfortable must i feel in working with my breast cancer doctor if he is a man?
nobody can answer your question only you can. it is your preference to have a male or female doctor as your doctor. you should look for whoever you feel comfortable so that you can build a good physician-patient relationship. so take a brief moment and really think about this question and listen to your heart. good luck.
how comfortable must i feel in working with my breast cancer doctor if he is a man?
i do not think gender should dictate how comfortable you should feel with your surgeon. it should not matter. if he is a good doctor and knows what he is doing the gender is secondary. www. drlugo. com.
how to test for breast cancer in a young woman?
depends on age. breast exam and ultrasound are usually the best modalities.
how to test for breast cancer in a young woman?
physical examination and mammogram would be the starting points in evaluating anyone for breast cancer.
how do i get tested for hereditary breast cancer?
the first step is to get a family history. if the history suggests a hereditary predisposition for breast cancer blood testing to evaluate for brca1 and brca2 mutations could be done.
how do i get tested for hereditary breast cancer?
if you meet certain criteria you are a candidate for brca testing. check out www. myriad. com.
how do i get tested for hereditary breast cancer?
if you have family history go see the oncologist that saw your relative and he/she will direct you.
how can you prevent hereditary breast cancer?
if you are concerned about an inherited predisposition for cancer you should visit a health professional with expertise in cancer risk assessment who will do a good interview a physical exam and a thorough family history. based on that he/she will decide what tests to order and what to do to reduce your risk. it is not a cookie cutter approach. best regards.
how can you prevent hereditary breast cancer?
it first depends on the type of genes that give you the risk of breast cancer. once the type of hereditary cancer is identified there is a discussion of options. treatment options will almost always include some form of surgery and frequent surveillance. there are some medicines that are good at reducing but not eliminating risk. while not necessary some people opt for removal of both breasts.
how can you prevent hereditary breast cancer?
women who are brca(+) have a 50-80% lifetime risk of breast cancer. the 3 best options currently are: 1-prophylactic bilateral mastectomy (+/-reconstruction); 2-chemoprevention with tamoxifen which may reduce the risk of cancer by 25-50% and; 3-close surveillance evaluation including regular breast mri. unfortunately none of these options are ideal-hopefully a better option is on the horizon.
how can you prevent hereditary breast cancer?
if you have a brca gene mutation best option is to discuss the situation with a medical/surgical oncologist. prophylactic mastectomy can remove the tissue at risk but close monitoring with mammogram ultrasound or mri are also options. brca patients are also at risk for ovarian cancer too. best to have formal evaluation with your doctor to discuss your personal situation.
how can you prevent hereditary breast cancer?
if it is hereditary you can prevent it by having mastectomies or in other words eliminating all breast tissue. if you want to keep your breasts and take a chance then monitor your breast closely.
how much does genetic testing for breast cancer cost?
if you have a valid reason to be tested-first degree family members breast cancer under age of 50 others in family with brca positive test (to name a few)-then it should be covered by your insurance carrier. depending on your insurance plan and deductible there may not be any out of pocket cost.
how much does genetic testing for breast cancer cost?
if you are paying cash it is expensive. over $1000. but if you are a risk or qualify it may be covered by your insurance. call your insurance and see if they cover it.
how would a man be diagnosed with breast cancer?
painless is the first sign bringing immediate attention to your physician and biopsy. lack of awareness causes delay in diagnosis 1% breast cancers are in men.
how would a man be diagnosed with breast cancer?
usually the same way as a woman. the usual reason for a test is a palpable mass. then a mmg or/ and u/s are done followed by a biopsy. www. drlugo. com.
how many scientists and researchers are studying solutions to breast cancer in the us? globally?
that's a difficult answer to quantify but rest assured it is many! in the us since it is the most common cancer in women funding and research for this disease is available through federal grants non-profit organizations private companies and grateful donors. we are making strides toward curing breast cancer every day!
how many scientists and researchers are studying solutions to breast cancer in the us? globally?
the exact number will always be hard to say but the number is a very large one. there are several research centers in th u. s. like memorial sloan kettering national institutes of health and the mayo clinic. in these centers are many subcenters including those devoted to cancer research with breast cancer being a prime example. the world has similar centers in many developed countries.
how many scientists and researchers are studying solutions to breast cancer in the us? globally?
many physicians treat a do clinical research for effective treatment for bc. the ultimate solution to bc will almost certainly come from work at a more basic level - much of which is keyed to basic biology and not focused on bc alone. so the investigators studying all aspects of bc probably number over 100 000 world wide.
how much money is spent annually studying solutions to breast cancer globally?
billions are spent globally still not enough to reach for cure more funds are needed for research and final goal 'the cure '.
how much money is spent annually studying solutions to breast cancer globally?
billions.
how can i tell if my breast cancer doctor is truly interested in a cure or me?
it must have been very tough and overwhelming for you to be diagnosed of having a breast cancer. in my opinion you should find a doctor whom you feel comfortable with and have a good trustable respectable doctor-patient's relationship to help you through your treatment etc for your breast cancer. so first discuss this question with your md if you dont think you can trust your doc-find other doc.
how can i tell if my breast cancer doctor is truly interested in a cure or me?
we hope that he went into that profession because he cares for people and wants to cure people. you have to use your judgement. he may care and be so busy that appears careless. ask him for more time with you. www. drlugo. com.
how to prevent further hereditary breast cancer?
women who are brca(+) have a 50-80% lifetime risk of breast cancer. the 3 best options currently are: 1-prophylactic bilateral mastectomy (+/-reconstruction); 2-chemoprevention with tamoxifen which may reduce the risk of cancer by 25-50% and; 3-close surveillance evaluation including regular breast mri. unfortunately none of these options are ideal-hopefully a better option is on the horizon.
how to prevent further hereditary breast cancer?
prevention of inherited disorders involves reproductive decisions and at this time there are no clear cut guidelines specific to breast cancer. a general statement could be made that people with known inherited and heritable genetic defects may consider limiting their reproduction. further developments in science may allow targeted exclusion of gametes with defective genes.
hereditary breast cancer treatment success rate as high as other forms?
matched stage-for-stage the response rate to treatment is no different for the hereditary or non-hereditary forms of breast cancer. the main difference is the risk of developing a second breast cancer or ovarian cancer: this is why many women with brca+ breast cancer opt for "prophylactic" (preventive) bilateral mastectomy and oophorectomy (removal of ovaries).
how and where does breast cancer spread?
breast cancer can advance locally in the breast to the skin and to the chest wall. it can spread regionally through the lymphatic channels to the lymph glands in the axilla (armpit) below and avove the collar bone and to the side of the neck. it can spread through the blood stream to distant organs such as bones liver lung brain and othe organs. this is called distant metastasis.
how and where does breast cancer spread?
most common route is through lymph node. some form of breast cancer can spread through blood stream quickly. most common organs breast cancer spread to are lung liver and bone.
how can early-stage breast cancer be treated?
always surgery: mastectomy and lumpectomy. in either case a sentinel node biopsy in the armpit (axilla) will be done and possibly a full axillary node dissection. usually (if > 1cm and/or estrogen receptor negative) chemotherapy and/or hormonal blockade. often radiotherapy: if no mastectomy or if mastectomy and + lymph nodes.
how can early-stage breast cancer be treated?
primary rx is surgical either lumpectomy or mastectomy (equal survival) with sentinel lymph node biopsy. if lump-x rx must then include radiation therapy. depending upon the stage and tumor-specific factors chemotherapy may be recommended. following these guidelines most women diagnosed with early stage breast cancer will be cured.
how often should i get a mammogram? seems like they keep changing recommendations.
if you have no family history of breast cancer current recommendation is to consider a baseline mammogram at age 40. some organizations recommend no mammos between 40-50 and some recommend every 1-2 years. after age 50 the recommendation by most organizations is every 1-2 years until mid-late 70's. the biggest controversy is for the 40-50 age group. you are too young for a screening mammo.
how fast does invasive ductal carcinoma begin metastasis?
it is well-established that cancer survival is related to timing of diagnosis however it's not that simple. some aggressive cancers may spread very early and others may never regardless of timing. furthermore one's overall health (and immune system) may play a major role. thankfully most breast cancers are curable.
how fast does a benign breast tumor grow?
different tumors grow at different rates. in general it takes a breast cancer about four years to become palpable from the time of onset. if left untreated a breast cance has an average life span of about four years from the time of diagnosis. these are average figures with wide variations among different tumors and patients.
how bad is diagnosis of invasive ductal carcinoma high grade?
not all breast cancers are the same and many other factors help to predict better or poorer outcomes such as tumor grade # of positive lymph nodes estrogen receptor status her2neu status etc. a score called oncotype dx based on genetic profiling of the cancer helps define prognosis also and tailor decisions as to the best and most beneficial treatment to use.
if you get a lump aspirated will this tell if you have breast cancer?
if it is a lump and not a cyst a core biopsy would be better. certainly if cancer is present on fna it means something. if it negative u still may need core or excision biopsy depending u upon risk factors.
if you get a lump aspirated will this tell if you have breast cancer?
the fluid will be sent to be looked at by a pathologist for signs of cancer cells--if there are none and the lump goes away after being aspirated it was likely a benign cyst.
is there any links between cervical cancer and breast cancer?
and breast cancer are related in that certain genetic defects make a person more susceptible to develop both. no such correlation with cervical cancer. causes of malignancy are multifactorial and we are just beginning to understand them.
is there any links between cervical cancer and breast cancer?
there is a possible genetic link between the two.
i started chemo for breast cancer what vitamins should i take?
you should discuss this with your medical oncologist. it is important to eat right and exercise during chemotherapy and you can often get everything you need from a diet rich in fruits and vegetables and low in saturated fats. but be careful taking too many supplements as some may interfere with the effectiveness of chemotherapy.
is breast cancer a concerning factor if my moms sister had it? i have some thickening up on chest that u can feel mam ok us was neg 1.
yes there is some concern compared to no family history but most breast cancer risk calculators are more interested in 1st degree relatives eg mom sister & daughter: <link> cancer. gov/bcrisktool/ & <link> as always close regular follow up w/your doc is key. so is good nutrition regular exercise & optimal weight.
is breast cancer a concerning factor if my moms sister had it? i have some thickening up on chest that u can feel mam ok us was neg 1.
depends on what age your aunt was diagnosed and if you have any other 1st degree family with breast ca under the age of 50. . also if you have any other risk factors.
is boron a synthetic estrogen? and is it to be avoided if you have had estrogen positive breast cancer but suffer from osteoporosis?
a cysts is simply a fluid filled structure within the ovary usually from ovulation. there are many different types of cysts most being benign. most will come and go on their own;however a few will grow large and cause symptoms.
is boron a synthetic estrogen? and is it to be avoided if you have had estrogen positive breast cancer but suffer from osteoporosis?
i have not heard about boron being a synthetic estrogen. it can theoretically cause thyroid issues because it can displace iodine which is important in building the thyroid hormone.
is boron a synthetic estrogen? and is it to be avoided if you have had estrogen positive breast cancer but suffer from osteoporosis?
multiple other available treatment for osteoporosis including biphosphonates calcitonin and teriparatide. also include resistance excercise and it d supplement if indicated.
is serum albumin an independent predictor of survival in patients with breast cancer?
i do not know of any data that point to albumin as an independent prognostic factor in early breast cancer. patients with advanced cancer often develop malnutrition and cachexia which will lower the albumin levels. those patients will do poorly so indirectly it may give you a rough idea of prognosis in those advanced cases.
im 39 not pregnt. no family history of breast cancer. mammogram in june '13 - normal. now have small amount clear fluid rt. breast only. no pain/lump?
i would recommend an office visit to fully evaluate. it is not too worrisome but should not be occurring.
im 39 not pregnt. no family history of breast cancer. mammogram in june '13 - normal. now have small amount clear fluid rt. breast only. no pain/lump?
any new discharge from the nipple should be evaluated with 'cytology' basically a pap smear of the fluid. please see your hcp for a careful breast exam possible breast ultrasound and further evaluation. don't ignore this.
i am stage 4 metastatic breast cancer. 1 yr ago it spread to ovaries and i had hysterectomy. do i stil need to have yearly papsmears.
i am terribly sorry about your situation. given that your original diagnosis of breast cancer had nothing to do with hpv or related changes to the cervix and assuming that you always had normal prior pap smears then you do not need to have annual pap smears. obviously you need pelvic exams at whatever interval your doctor recommended though.
i am stage 4 metastatic breast cancer. 1 yr ago it spread to ovaries and i had hysterectomy. do i stil need to have yearly papsmears.
it is recommended to continue with pap smears after a hysterectomy for cancerous reasons. the pap smear will collect cells from your vaginal walls. this is to make sure that potential cancerous cells are not still present after surgery and to rule out the potential development of new ones. continue paps every 1-2years.
is it ok to take herbalife cell activator after breast cancer?
herbal life cell activator like any herbal products is not regulated by the fda and therefore there are no data on its efficacy and safety. most of the time patients are just wasting a lot of hteir money on these products. i do not recommend taking it during chemo treatment since it has antioxidants and may reverse the effect of chemo. in your case i suppose it is ok but again there is no data.
i have stage 4 breast cancer. my anc count today was. 5 can rest help bring it up? i also started nupogen injections today.
i do not believe rest will help your blood counts come back but neupogen should. give it some time. follow the recommendations of your oncologist to prevent infections and call him/her right away if you develop a fever or any sign of infection. best to you.
i have stage 4 breast cancer. my anc count today was. 5 can rest help bring it up? i also started nupogen injections today.
help bring it up- resting is fine till you feel better- best of luck. .
its a great honour to meet u. sir can u please tell me the symptoms of breast cancer? in female. age 18 years?
the most common sign/symptom is the presence of a lump in the breast. other symptoms include nipple discharge nipple inversion skin indentation and breast pain. nevertheless the majority of people diagnosed with breast cancer have no symptoms whatsoever. the best way to diagnose breast cancer early is to have routine screening mammograms beginning at age 40.
its a great honour to meet u. sir can u please tell me the symptoms of breast cancer? in female. age 18 years?
it is very rare to have breast cancer before the age of 30. the most common symptom is a painless breast lump that one can feel. lumps can also be seen by mammogram.
its a great honour to meet u. sir can u please tell me the symptoms of breast cancer? in female. age 18 years?
worry is the breast cancer very very rare for a cancer age is no exception if at all develop will appear as painless lump in the breast. at 18 if you are afraid of breast cancer must speak to your doctor in some anxious people with phobias may need professional help & counseling.
i have bruise like pain on my left breast dor a week but no bruise. i don't feel a lump but its really sore. is this a sign of breast cancer?
breast cancer does not hurt. you also are not in the age category for the condition and self exam is negative. i also do not know were are u in your cycle. you can wait and see what happens but if anxious the best go see your gynecologist.
i have bruise like pain on my left breast dor a week but no bruise. i don't feel a lump but its really sore. is this a sign of breast cancer?
breast cancer usually is a lump that you can feel or that can be seen on mammogram. given your young age and no lump it is very unlikely to be breast cancer. if you have breast cancer in your family history you could see your physician to get it checked out. but probably nothing to worry about.
is most breast cancer detected from focal asymmetry?
most breast cancer cases are identified on screening mammograms. these breast lesions are usually small and does not cause asymetry. however when the cancer is more advanced it can create dimpling in the skin of the breast or retraction of the nipple or asymetry of the two breasts or even swelling or rednessof the breast. one can often detect the breast lump in these cases on self examination.
is it true that n testing a lot of lumps in breast that you can not have whole breast ultrasound? im being scheduled for a double mastectomy instead
breast ultrasound in the setting of multiple lumps. why are you having a double mastectomy? are you a brca carrier or have you been diagnosed with bilateral breast cancer? if not breast mri is highly sensitive for detecting cancer and might help avoid a potentially unnecessary surgery.
is breast augumentation safe? is thrre a ridk of breast cancer in future?
it is a safe procedure but should be done by board certified plastic surgeon. there is no increased risk of breast cancer.
is breast augumentation safe? is thrre a ridk of breast cancer in future?
studies have shown breast augmentation to be a safe procedure without an increase in cancer later on in life.
is this breast cancer? i have tight upper back muscles from inactivity andbad posture. myleft breast is sensitive all the time. i also have indigestion
the symptoms you described are unlikely related to breast cancer. you need to increase your activity levels or do physical therapy. at your age hormonal change can cause breast sensitivity. all the best hk.
is this breast cancer? i have tight upper back muscles from inactivity andbad posture. myleft breast is sensitive all the time. i also have indigestion
there is nothing in your question that would in any way imply a possibility of breast cancer.
is this breast cancer? i have tight upper back muscles from inactivity andbad posture. myleft breast is sensitive all the time. i also have indigestion
breast cancer at age 18? no my dear sleep well u don;t have breast cancer because your breast is sensitive! get in shape and if there is a posture problem see an orthopedist and possibly a physical therapist to improve posture. hey go and live your life you are only 18!
is this breast cancer? i have tight upper back muscles from inactivity andbad posture. myleft breast is sensitive all the time. i also have indigestion
why inactivity? get some exercise. is bad posture due to scoliosis? did you do any self-examination of breast to r/o any mass? or need a doctor to exam your breast.
is this breast cancer? i have tight upper back muscles from inactivity andbad posture. myleft breast is sensitive all the time. i also have indigestion
don't sound worrisome have your family doctor check your breast sensitivity. you might have a cyst or fibrocystic changes that could explain your tenderness.
if i have breast cancer background should i not take primrose oil?
if you have ' breast cancer back ground ' first you should have regular check up by your doctor yearly mammogram evaluations and if several of your family members had it consider genetic counseling and testing. the primrose oil only as health supplement due to its omega fatty acids in it.
i've been on natureday breast products for about a week. will it cause breast cancer? will it effect my birth control? i've felt tingling already.
other than wasting your money on breast enlargement creams its ingredients should not cause any harm.
i had a chest cat. scan today and am due for a mammogram. is a mammogram necessary now?
a chest ct will occasionally pick up a breast cancer but mammography is much more sensitive. there is no data to suggest that chest ct has any value as a screening modality for breast cancer.
i had a chest cat. scan today and am due for a mammogram. is a mammogram necessary now?
ct is not a recommended modality for breast cancer screening.
i had breast cancer & need tvus to check for ovarian ca. but at 67 can't tolerate the tvus probe-can i get meds/anesthetic to undergo successful tvus?
conscious sedation is 'light' anesthesia (not quite general anesthesia) and this might be just enough to get through the tvus.
i had breast cancer & need tvus to check for ovarian ca. but at 67 can't tolerate the tvus probe-can i get meds/anesthetic to undergo successful tvus?
this is called an eua or an examination under anesthesia. it is a common procedure and ultrasound can easily be incorporated into it.
i have ectopic axillary breast issue does this make me more prone to breast cancer. it is not painful ihave this under both armpits for the past 10yr?
incidence will be same how ever breast cancer can develop in the ectopic breast tissue also.
is upper back pain considered one of the signs of breast cancer?
many people have back pain; so back pain by itself is not a sign of breast cancer. however if you have a history of breast cancer or if you find a lump in your breast or axilla (armpit) then you should check with your doctor since breast cancer frequently travels to bone. if the backpain persists do go see your doctor (not necessary for breast cancer but to evalaute also for other reasons).
is 17 too young to get a mammogram done?
if you have a lump or other symptom you should see your doctor for evaluation. breast cancer is rare in your age group. if imaging is needed mammography would not be the study of choice it would be ultrasound. otherwise for the average risk woman screening mammo should begin at 40.
i have heterogenous breast and a density showed up on mam called back for diag mammagram mother had breast cancer and they compared it to last year?
many times with an abnormal mammogram the radiologists will compare it to previous mammograms. they may also do a breast sonogram. finally if there is some change they may decide to do a biopsy. that is the normal order of evaluation.
i have heterogenous breast and a density showed up on mam called back for diag mammagram mother had breast cancer and they compared it to last year?
history of breast cancer and a mass on mam ned to be invetigated.
i have pain and soreness directly under the left breast near the top of the rib cage. i had a lumpectomy 4 years ago on the left side of breast just?
pain in the rib cage can be due to costochondritis. this is an inflammation of the cartilage where the rib meets the sternum. if you press the spot does it hurt? if so it could be costochondritis. you mentioned a previous breast biopsy did you have invasive breast cancer? if so all the more reason to see your doctor.
i had chemo for breast cancer and a bone scan indicated a spot on my clavicle. my br cancer is gone but not the spot on the clavicle. what is it?
without seeing the images its difficult to answer this question. where in the clavicle (i. e mid vs at sternoclavicular joint) morphology of the lesion and correlation to cross sectional imaging like ct/mri are important in further delineating the possible etiology of the "spot" (increased uptake in radiology lingo). it's also important to mention if you had trauma to the area. talk to your doc!
i had chemo for breast cancer and a bone scan indicated a spot on my clavicle. my br cancer is gone but not the spot on the clavicle. what is it?
how was the "spot" detected? depending on location in the clavicle it could be degenerative disease. if you had a ct or pet/ct of the chest that exam can be used to further characterize the "spot". some times biopsy (bx) is necessary is necessary to determine the cause of the spot but correlate with other studies before a bx.
is it safe to take medroxyprogesterone if i have an extremely large family history of breast cancer? it was prescribed for my endometriosis.
progesterone is not generally associated with increasing cancer risk. estrogen is more likely to promote those issues
if my father sisters are died because of breast cancer how much chances of mine to develop this disease?
breast cancer affects one in seven women so having an aunt or two with breast cancer is not unusual. more important though is to know how old they were. if they were under age 45 that is cause for concern. make sure that you follow breast cancewr screening guidelines when the time comes. for now i would just pay particular attention if you develop any unusual lumps. early diagnosis = key.
if my father sisters are died because of breast cancer how much chances of mine to develop this disease?
sorry to hear about your aunts. having a mother or sister with breast cancer is associated with increased risk esp. if they got it when young. having paternal aunts with breast cancer is associated with slight increased risk esp. if they were below age 50 when they got it but the risk is significantly less than if it was your mom or sister. see <link> for tips on prevention.
i'm 68 i have visible blue veins in my left breast nothing in my right. had mammogram 4 mos ago and breast exam by doc 3 mos. are veins sign of bc?
as an isolated finding visible veins are not associated with breast cancer. is there associated pain or swelling? if you are concerned about it have your doctor take a look.
i'm 68 i have visible blue veins in my left breast nothing in my right. had mammogram 4 mos ago and breast exam by doc 3 mos. are veins sign of bc?
breast cancer will rarely cause venous problem like you have. it is more related to circulation. have your primary care doctor monitor the veins for any further enlargement or any new veins showing up which may justify checking your circulation(veins and arteries in the chest wall and in the left arm region. nothing immediately worrisome.
is it too risky for me to take birth control pills? my mom's a breast cancer survivor. is it worth it to take them?
birth control pills do not cause breast cancer. so short term use for one or two years at a time is not likely to cause any significant problems. i think the benefit outweighs the risks. yet it is all relative and you only can decide what is best for you.
is it too risky for me to take birth control pills? my mom's a breast cancer survivor. is it worth it to take them?
there is a very small increased risk of breast cancer with the use of birth control pills. our best guess so far is that use of triphasic pills are the primary culprit. it might be worth verifying with your pharmacist that your pills are not triphasic. also note that birth control pills seem to lower the risk of other cancers. starting birth control pills as a teenager seems to raise risk.
can a healthy diet help prevent breast cancer?
you can't completely prevent breast cancer with diet alone. however a diet low in animal fat low in alcohol (less than 4 drinks per week) and low in total calories will decrease your risk of breast cancer. fat cells make estrogen so if you are overweight decreasing your weight and exercising regularly has been proven to decrease your risk!
can a healthy diet help prevent breast cancer?
obesity increases your risk of developing several different types of cancers.
can a healthy diet help prevent breast cancer?
studies have shown that obesity especially after menopause is associated with an increased risk of breast cancer. the effects of a high-fat diet are little less clear-cut with conflicting data.
can an abortion increase the risk of breast cancer?
early retrospective studies gave conflicting results regarding the potential link between abortions and breast cancer. over the past decade more accurate prospective studies have failed to show any link between breast cancer and women who had abortions either spontaneous or induced.
can an abortion increase the risk of breast cancer?
i agree with the previous author that there is debate; however many of the studies that show an association are small groups of people and therefore can't show proof of cause of breast cancer. prevention of pregnancy is better than an abortion for many reasons -- cost and risk being one of them. however if you have had an abortion get a breast exam regularly *like everyone should! *.
can breast cancer spread under your arm?
as many as 1/3 of all people diagnosed with breast cancer are found to have microscopic evidence of cancer in the lymph nodes under their armpit. we use this information to guide further therapy making this a critical part of breast cancer surgery. in the past we would remove 10-20 lymph nodes to determine this. now this information can be found by removing a few "sentinel" lymph nodes.
can breast cancer spread under your arm?
yes.
can drinking alcohol increase the risk of breast cancer?
studies show that women who drink more than 4 drinks per week are at a higher risk of developing breast cancer. this may be because alcohol can limit the liver's ability to break down estrogen causing elevated estrogen levels.
can drinking alcohol increase the risk of breast cancer?
this is a controversial topic but most major studies agree that heavy drinking increases risk by about 10% for each daily drink. it is extremely difficult to measure the effect if any of low to modrate drinking especially when it comes to wine. at least one good study from france found that daily consumption of up to 2 glasses of red wine per day was associated with a significantly lower risk.
can drinking alcohol increase the risk of breast cancer?
use of alcohol in a inappropiate manner such as continous alcohol dependency has been found to increase the chances of developing breast cancer.
can i inherit breast cancer?
breast cancer is not directly passed from parent to child. however an increased risk of developing breast cancer can be inherited. mutations in the genes brca1 and brca2 increase your chance of developing breast cancer. you are not 100% guaranteed to get breast cancer if you inherit these genes but the risk can be as high as 85%.
can i inherit breast cancer?
hereditary breast cancer occurs approximately in 15% of cases- majority of breast cancer is sporadic disease. your risk will depend on how significant your family history of breast cancer ovarian cancer or other type of cancer- such as colon endometrial/uterine cancer etc. the more significant your family history of cancer- the higher is your risk of having an inherited/hereditary cancer.
can i inherit breast cancer?
approximately 10-15% of breast cancers in the us are hereditary. most of these arise due to a mutation in the brca genes. these can be determined by a simple blood test. approximately 2/3 of all women with one of these mutations will eventually develop breast cancer. there is a 50:50 chance that any child will inherit this mutation.
can physical activity reduce the risk of breast cancer?
studies have shown that people who exercise daily may have a lower risk for breast cancer; this is particularly true for those that exercise prior to menopause.
can physical activity reduce the risk of breast cancer?
physical activity can decrease your risk of breast cancer.
can physical activity reduce the risk of breast cancer?
physical activity reduces the risk of breast and other cancers.
can wearing a bra all the time give me breast cancer?
no scientific evidence.
can wearing a bra all the time give me breast cancer?
there is no evidence to support.
can wearing a bra all the time give me breast cancer?
wearing a bra is not a recognized risk of breast cancer. please remember to ask your doctor about breast self exam and screening mammograms at your next visit.
can there be a link between breast cancer and ovarian cancer?
there are some genetic blood tests brca type. so far there is brca i and brca 2. this doesn't mean you can't have an inherited form of breast ca and ovarian ca---as of now not yet discovered and no blood test to determine a patient's risk. a woman can have breast and ovarian cancer and have negative genetic tests----we don't have all the answers yet.
can there be a link between breast cancer and ovarian cancer?
app. 10% of all cases of breast and ovarian ca in the us are of the hereditary type many of which are associated with mutations in the brca genes. women with brca mutations have a 60-70% lifetime risk of developing breast ca and a 15-40% chance of ovarian ca. women with a strong family history of breast and/or ovarian ca may have a simple blood test to check for these mutations.
can there be a link between breast cancer and ovarian cancer?
hereditary breast cancer increases your risk of both ovarian and breasts cancers.
can you please explain breast cancer?
cancer that forms in tissues of the breast usually the ducts (tubes that carry milk to the nipple) and lobules (glands that make milk). it occurs in both men and women although male breast cancer is rare. read more here : <link>
can you please explain breast cancer?
uncontrolled cell growth in the breast typically of ductal or lobular origin.
can you please explain breast cancer?
cancer by definition is the growth in size and number in an unregulated manner of a cell line that has developed a mutation. the mutation is passed through the offspring which accumulate more and more mutations. the defining factor is that the cells act immortal as compared to normal cells that have a programmed lifespan. in the breast this can occur in the cells in different lobules or ducts.
can you please explain breast cancer?
breast cancer is a type of cancer which originates from breast tissue.
can you please explain breast cancer?
breast cancer is synonymous with breast carcinoma and occurs in either the breast ducts or lobules commonly. breast cancer ranges from dcis which is the mildest form to a large primary breast tumor with extensive spread all over the body. at age 23 it would be unusual to have this disease. if you have a strong family history or a breast lump that you are concerned about see your pcp or breast md.
can breast cancer be prevented?
mastectomy of both breasts will be recommended to prevent the development of breast cancer in patients who carry genetic abnormality such as brca 1 or 2 as this genetic abnormality will increase their risk to have breast cancer and ovarian cancer significantly. tamoxifen is given to patients with high risk feature like precancerous /in situ to reduce risk for recurrence of in situ or cancer.
can breast cancer be prevented?
for patients at very high risk (very strong family history or known genetic mutation) bilateral prophylactic mastectomies are an option. taking tamoxifen can also cut the risk of breast cancer by half. for the typical woman the risk of getting breast cancer can be reduced by maintaining a healthy body weight getting regular exercise and eating a more plant-based diet.
can breast cancer be prevented?
unfortunately we only have limited knowledge of the specific causes of breast cancer making it difficult to identify methods to prevent it. nevertheless women at high risk for breast cancer may take tamoxifen for "chemoprevention": 5 years of therapy may reduce their lifetime risk of developing breast cancer by as much as 50%.

tamoxifen and raloxifene have been shown to reduce the risk of er+ breast cancer by 40-50%. ais more recently (study of exemestane) increase this rate to 65-75%. chemoprevention has side effects to be weighed. prophylactic mastectomy is >90% effective in risk reduction but is a very aggessive intervention most appropriate to know mutation carriers (brca 1/2) with a lifetime risk of 70-90%.
can thyroid cancer increase breast cancer risk?
there are some families who have increased rates of a variety of cancers including papillary thyroid cancer breast cancer and colon cancer. but having one does not cause an risk for another; instead inherited genes put a person at increased risk for both. a person with a history of thyroid cancer should be sure to get recommended mammograms and colon tests.

can my grandmother develop breast cancer and ovarian cancer at the exact same time?
there are two ways this can happen: 1. she had breast cancer with "drop metastases" meaning spread of breast cancer to the ovaries. this can happen with breast cancers that have the estrogen receptor. 2. she had both breast and ovarian cancer at the same time mostly likely associated with a brca mutation. with this history you may benefit from genetic counseling and/or testing.
can my grandmother develop breast cancer and ovarian cancer at the exact same time?
there are some genetic mutations that can increase the risk of both ovarian and breast cancer. if a woman has both she should have genetic testing beginning with the brca 1 and 2 genes. if your grandmother has that gene there is a 50% chance her child inherited it and a 25% chance you may have inherited it.
can my grandmother develop breast cancer and ovarian cancer at the exact same time?
women with breast cancer have a 3x higher rate of ovarian cancer as compared to the general population. furthermore women with a brca mutation may have a 50-75% chance of developing breast cancer and a 15-45% chance of ovarian cancer. therefore it is possible to be diagnosed with both diseases simultaneously.

young and old after the diagnosis of papillary adenocarcinoma confined to duct ductal carcinoma in situ and invasive cancer. the first 2 are quite benign but portend of the potential to develop invasive cancer. invasive cancer can arise in the duct or in the lobules. the special bad feature of younger and especially african american women is "triple (receptor) negative" - no er pr or her-2-neu.
how to prevent hereditary breast cancer?
keep current on mammography. stop smoking maintain an ideal body weight. depending on how strong your family history is and if you have a proven genetic mutation you could be a candidate for prophylactic mastectomy with or without removal of the ovaries. visit with a medical oncologist to find out your options.
how to prevent hereditary breast cancer?
implies "fixing the underlying defect" and this sort of genetic engineering has not arrived - vectoring the gene in may not lead to its propoer regulation (turning on and off properly for instance). early detection--proper cost effective screening or avoidance of co-factors for induction seem resaonable choics.
history of breast cancer in my family. will a mammogram show anything if tiny tumor?
depending on your breast density/composition on mammography a tumor as small as 3-4 mm may be identified.

you would best discuss this with the plastic surgeon and radiatin oncologist before assuming that you can.
can i still get breast implants after having breast cancer and radiation?
radiation causes irreversible damage to the skin that actually worsens over time. this can cause the skin over the implant to break down and expose the implant. many post-radiation implant reconstructions are done in conjunction with a flap of skin from the back for added safety. a skin flap from the abdomen without implants avoids these risks and arguably offers better long-term aesthetics.
can i still get breast implants after having breast cancer and radiation?
although you can get implants after breast cancer and radiation the results may be unpredictable. radiation may cause some soft tissue fibrosis which may not allow the skin to stretch reliably. although some people are fine with radiation i think they tend to be the exception rather than the norm.
can a teenager die from breast cancer?
it would be exceedingly rare.
can a teenager die from breast cancer?
it is rare for primary breast cancer to arise in the teenage years. but since you are aware of this disease don't forget to discuss mammograms and pap smears with doctor.
can a teenager die from breast cancer?
but highly unlikely. the incidence of breast cancer in teenagers is exceedingly low less than 1 in a million in the us. if a teenager were diagnosed with breast cancer the chance for cure would be no different than an adult based on the stage of cancer at diagnosis.
could you tell me if in the family tree nobody have gotten breast cancer before will there be a range of people getting breast cancer?
the reality is that all women are at risk. 1 of every 8 women will be diagnosed with breast cancer in there lifetime. get your mammograms done.
could you tell me if in the family tree nobody have gotten breast cancer before will there be a range of people getting breast cancer?
8-9 out of 10 women who get breast cancer do not have any family history of breast cancer. the overall risk for a woman to get breast cancer in her lifetime is about 1 in 8. that is why regular self breast exams and screening mammograms are so important-- to pick up breast cancer early in women who have no obvious risks.
could you tell me if in the family tree nobody have gotten breast cancer before will there be a range of people getting breast cancer?
a common misconception is that women without family histories of breast cancer are not at risk. in reality 85-90% of all breast cancers are not hereditary; therefore all women are "at risk" for breast cancer with a 1/8 lifetime risk in the us.
can breast implants increase the chances of having breast cancer? my gma had breast cancer so its kinda in the family.
breast implants don't increase your risk for developing breast cancer but they do make it more difficult to feel a breast lump. they also might make it harder to see an abnormality on mammogram. a breast mri might be necessary for you but the radiologist who reads your mammograms will let you know. and you should still do self breast exams!
can breast implants increase the chances of having breast cancer? my gma had breast cancer so its kinda in the family.
it has not been shown statistically that patients with breast implants have a higher risk of breast cancer.
can breast implants increase the chances of having breast cancer? my gma had breast cancer so its kinda in the family.
statistically women with breast implants have a lower incidence of breast cancer. this is thought to be more related to the fact that these women have less breast tissue rather than something as a result of the implant itself.
can breast implants increase the chances of having breast cancer? my gma had breast cancer so its kinda in the family.
breast implants do not cause cancer but they may delay the diagnosis without effecting the prognosis. however your overall risk and genetic assessment should be evaluatwd by a health care professional with diagnostic imaging considered over the age of 35 as a consideration.
can breast implants increase the chances of having breast cancer? my gma had breast cancer so its kinda in the family.
you get them as safely as anyone as far as statistics dictate.
can breast implants increase the chances of having breast cancer? my gma had breast cancer so its kinda in the family.
your risks of getting or even detecting a breast cancer is unaffected by implants. you must do the same careful exams and screening with or without implants.
can breast implants increase the chances of having breast cancer? my gma had breast cancer so its kinda in the family.
breast implants do not increase the chances of having breast cancer.
can breast implants increase the chances of having breast cancer? my gma had breast cancer so its kinda in the family.
family history of breast cancer is always a concern. brac testing and yearly mammographic studies are a good starting point. yearly breast examinations by your pc or gyn also help. and of course weekly self examination. as for a relationship between breast implants and cancer there has been no scientific study to confirm such a relationship. thus you can have implants. seek a boarded ps. regards.
can inflammatory breast cancer symptoms get better with antibiotics and then get worse once off antibiotics?
inflammatory breast cancer is a type of breast cancer where the lymphatics that drain the skin of the breast become plugged by cancer cells giving the appearance of an infection. antibiotics should only affect bacterial infections and since the breast is not infected with this form of cancer antibiotics should have no effect.
can inflammatory breast cancer symptoms get better with antibiotics and then get worse once off antibiotics?
ibc can improve with certain antibiotics because they decrease inflammatory proteins. this can cause a delay in diagnosis. however a breast infection or cellulitis can also improve and then worsen off antibiotics. if you have persistent redness swelling or breast pain that has not resolved after several weeks of antibiotics please see a breast specialist as soon as possible!
can inflammatory breast cancer symptoms get better with antibiotics and then get worse once off antibiotics?
inflammatory breast cancer is not due to infection with associated inflammation. rather it is a superficial form of tumor highly aggressive and invading the subcutanceous lymphatics to give the red appearance around the tumor which appears as an area of swollen tissue. . bx will show the subcutaneous lymphatics plugged with tumor which responds to hormones and chemo
can sore nipples and tender breast mean breast cancer or swelling in the breast? no period coming and not pregnant what is it?
it is unlikely however if it persists you should see your doctor for an exam.
can sore nipples and tender breast mean breast cancer or swelling in the breast? no period coming and not pregnant what is it?
unfortunately i am not going to say unlikely i have seen patients with sore nipples itchy breasts itchy rash on breasts nipple discharge tingling sensations in breast --variations of the above with / without pain-----go on to have breast cancer. it may not be typical but earliest detection is a must. a "neg" mammogram and/or ultrasound does not mean you can't have ca. see specialists bx.
can sore nipples and tender breast mean breast cancer or swelling in the breast? no period coming and not pregnant what is it?
its unlikely to be cancer. but it could be a sign of infection inflammation or even pregnancy. suggest you consult your doctor who can examine you and check for pregnancy too.
can i take vitamin d while on chemotherapy for breast cancer?
this vitamin does not effect chemotherapy. do no take more than the recommended amount.
can i take vitamin d while on chemotherapy for breast cancer?
there are no contraindications to vitamin d supplementation while on chemotherapy. there are vitamin d receptors found in breast tissue. vitamin d has been shown to decrease the chance of developing certain benign and malignant types of breast cancer. however in the case of active breast cancer while on chemotherapy i do not believe there's any data showing benefits of vitamin d during chemo.
can i take vitamin d while on chemotherapy for breast cancer?
i've written an article on this very topic which can be found at mdprevent. blogspot. com while taking vitamin d is not expected to interfere with the chemotherapy it probably will do little to help with the breast cancer prognosis.

can i work as a firefighter while taking xanax my wife has stage 4 breast cancer and the stress was giving me anxiety. i was prescribe. 05 mg xanax 2x per day i feel it has helped me. however i don't know how my employer will feel about it
hello. i do not know that answer to that question. here is the problem a medication like xanax (alprazolam) is mood altering. it can make you sedated or slow your reaction times. this could make you less responsive and less effective as a fire fighter. you are in a high risk profession so you need to be fully aware and awake. if you were a diver or a pilot in the military being on this type of mediation (benzodiazapine) would render you unsuitable for the job. my guess would be that there are guidelines for health restrictions in your area. the most responsible thing to do is to talk to your employer about it. i am very sorry about your wife's illness. take care.
can i work as a firefighter while taking xanax my wife has stage 4 breast cancer and the stress was giving me anxiety. i was prescribe. 05 mg xanax 2x per day i feel it has helped me. however i don't know how my employer will feel about it
despite the side effects of medications like xanax (alprazolam) such as motor impairment due to its sedation properties you would be surprised at how many people take it and still function; i believe it depends on multiple variables (e. g. how often one takes such medications dose other medications taken with it age of patient type of job). it'll lessen your reaction times due to anti-anxiety effects and being that you are in a high risk job i'd look at other treatments available for your anxiety. there is tolerance phenomena to deal with using these kinds of medications as well.
cancer radiation treatment i started radiation treatment for breast cancer. i met with the technicians several times. the technicians stated the treatment is complex. they did not agree with the measurements and stated they would not treat me until the
so waht do you want to know from us doctors. please make it brief.
can you let me know how many patients get lymphedema from having lymphnodes removed when cancer spread?
lymphedema secondary to breast cancer surgery is more related to the number of lymph nodes removed +/- radiation to the armpit rather than the presence or absence of cancer within the nodes. when a traditional axillary dissection is performed the risk is app. 25%. this rate is <5% if only a few nodes are removed as we often do with sentinel lymph node biopsy.
can breast cancer spread to the brain be cured?
unfortunately a cure would be very unlikely. but survivial time and quality of life are increasing there are meds that can treat disease that spreads and newer treatment that involve radiation that specfically targets small tumors. reasearch and trials of antibodies targeting certain tumor types continue. still the best way is finding the breast cancer very early in the breast through exams etc.
can breast cancer spread to the brain be cured?
when breast cancer spreads to other organ beyond the breast area- lung liver bones brain --it is called metastasis. this is a stage iv disease-and is considered to be incurable disease unfortunately .
can breast cancer spread to the brain be cured?
metastatic breast cancer especially to the brain is generally not curable. however treatment may reduce symptoms and improve quality of life.
can a 75 year ol male get breast cancer?
if a mass then needs mammogram.
can a 75 year ol male get breast cancer?
yes it can. it happens most often to men between the ages of 60 and 70. a 75 year old man can get breast cancer. however as you know breast cancer in man is rare.
can a 75 year ol male get breast cancer?
it is rare.
confused by all the changes in recommendations for screening for women. whats the latest for mammograms?
ever changing guidelines for screening conditions can be confusing. your family history and personal risk assessment is most important when deciding screening for breast cancer. consult with your caregiver who knows your history. remember self breast examination complements your mammogram exam. women age 50 and over should have a yearly mammogram.
clitoris shrinkage i am 54 y. o. post menopausal breast cancer survivor x 2 have rheumatoid arthritis. i attribute the shrinkage to strong vibrator use for many years. is there anything i can do to restore the size of my clitoris?
the changes you are describing are unlikely to be related to your behavior and more likely hormonally related to decreased estrogens.
clitoris shrinkage i am 54 y. o. post menopausal breast cancer survivor x 2 have rheumatoid arthritis. i attribute the shrinkage to strong vibrator use for many years. is there anything i can do to restore the size of my clitoris?
the number of nerves in your clitoris would remain unchanged regardless of it's size. you have nothing to worry about.
clitoris shrinkage i am 54 y. o. post menopausal breast cancer survivor x 2 have rheumatoid arthritis. i attribute the shrinkage to strong vibrator use for many years. is there anything i can do to restore the size of my clitoris?
hello. i don't know if your use of a vibrator has contributed to clitoral shrinkage. however because you are postmenopausal your estrogen levels have dropped. this can cause the clitoris labia and vagina to have shrinkage. because you are a breast cancer survivor only your doctor would be able to tell you if the risk of hormone replacement therapy or hormone creams for the vaginal area is worth the possible benefit.
can small breast women have breast cancer detected easier?
it may be easier to palpate a lump in a small breast because there is less tissue however some brest cancers are only found on mamogram. i would not use the fact that u have small breasts to forgo getting screening mamograms.
can small breast women have breast cancer detected easier?
breast cancer detection by mammography depends on the differences in the tumor tissue and normal breast. a small breast is more conducive to a better image as long as it does not have excessive fibrous tissue.
can small breast women have breast cancer detected easier?
sometimes mammograms are harder to do in small women and so a cancer may be harder to detect. if breast tissue gets fibrosed that may make it harder also.
can early breast development lead to higher risk of breast cancer?
people who go thru puberty at an early age and/or menopause late in life have a slightly higher risk of breast cancer. we believe this is due to prolonged exposure to high estrogen levels.
can early breast development lead to higher risk of breast cancer?
breast cancer risk is associated with higher hormone levels lack of breastfeeding and no childbearing. conversely late age of menarche pregnancy (especially by age 1<positive_smiley> and early menopause reduce the risk of breast cancer as apparently does breastfeeding. early breast development would probably mean higher hormones so the risk would be higher. fibrocystic breast changes also increase risk.
can a child have breast milk from a mother who has breast cancer?
it would not be a good idea to do this since some breast cancers may involve the very ducts that the milk flows down from. it would be wise to check with your doctor on this.
can a child have breast milk from a mother who has breast cancer?
breast milk will not transmit cancer to the child babies do not have any higher incidence of breast cancer in later part of life however physicians do not recommend breast feeding mothers with cancer. cancer medication radio isotopes will pass into milk also. htlv-1 virus. breast ca transmission is seen in mice but not in humans.
how to increase breast size naturally?
plastic surgeon and inquire about breast implants. fat grafting to the breasts is often marketed as "natural" breast augmentation but not all of the transferred fat survives and can cause scar tissue and calcifications that interfere with the mammographic diagnosis of breast cancer. not worth it. wait a few years when a few of women with fat transfer have cancer but miss or delay the diagnosis!
how old should i be before i get a boob job?
breast implants are it a need even in the event of breast cancer. they are an elective surgical option that carries risks serious ones that should be fully understood. you need to know the potential complications and outcomes and alternatives. you should insist that your surgeon discuss these with you. this is a lifelong undertaking and should not be decided on a whim. society sets an age of 18.
how can a ultrasound miss breast cancer?
mammogram is the gold standard for breast cancer screening ultrasonds are used to differenciate solid/fluid filled cysts and serve that purpose. ultrasond can miss cancers more often. mammogams can also miss some early cancers and has well recognised limitations. so ultrasond and magnetic resonance imaging is used along with mammograms in high risk patients.
how can a ultrasound miss breast cancer?
the breast can be difficult to image due to dense glandular tissue. in addition some tumors are very hard to see. no imaging test is perfect and often we will use a combination of mammogram ultrasound and mri depending on the density of the breast tissue and other risk factors. it is important that if you feel a lump even if your imaging is "negative" to see a specialist.
how can a ultrasound miss breast cancer?
breast ultrasound is used to distinguish cystic vs solid mass and then decide need for biopsy. mammogram is used for diagnosing breast cancer and yes it may sometime miss cancer.
how can a ultrasound miss breast cancer?
it is directed by the mammo to an area to define size shape solid/cystic. emerging technology: breast u/s tomo uses an array of detectors similar to ct. very sensitive even in dense breast but not available most places.
how long after getting breast cancer will a person start to notice the symptoms?
it is said that on average it takes 5 yrs for a breast cancer to become palpable. however every cancer has it's own growth rate & generalizations like this are meaningless. the fact is that most women develop no symptoms until the cancer has grown quite large--cancer has a way of "flying under the radar". best bet: yearly mammograms beginning at 40 to find the cancers before symptoms develop.
how do you get tested for breast cancer?
physical examination by your doctor and mammogram is the starting point. sometimes additional testing such as ultrasound mri scan or needle biopsy may be indicated.
how do you get tested for breast cancer?
evaluation for breast cancer starts with you. eamine yourself monthly and once a year visit your md for an exam and a mammogram. mammograms only find two out of three breast cas so the exam is very important. if an abnormality is found a biopsy will be taken and that is when the initial diagnosis is made.
how do you get tested for breast cancer?
at 43 yo you should have screening mammogram yearly. if it detects an abnormality then further tests such as ultrasound or breast mri can be conducted. the definitive answer is through a biopsy of the abnormality. you should also perform self exam monthly. if you feel a lump in your breast go see your doctor for a diagnostic mammogram. mammogram can be negative in some patients with breast canc.
how often do mammograms miss breast cancer?
mammograms are the best most cost-effective method for identifying non-palpable breast cancers but are by no means perfect. some cancers (infiltrating lobular) are very difficult to see on mammography. furthermore some women have very dense breast tissue that obscures visualization of a cancer. therefore a normal mammogram should never determine how to evaluate a palpable breat lump.
how often do mammograms miss breast cancer?
the miss rate is a little less than 10% but that number changes with a number of factors. younger women tend to have dense breast tissue and have a higher miss rate. much older women have a better rate because of more fatty tissue. mri is too sensitive and leads to many findings that are not cancer. the key point is if you have a mass or change in the breast a mammogram is not enough to be sure.
how often do mammograms miss breast cancer?
about 15% of breast cancers won't show on a mammogram so if you have a lump a negative mammogram doesn't completely rule out cancer. ultrasound can also be helpful and sometimes a biopsy is recommended even if the imaging is negative depending on other factors.
how often should you get a mammogram?
this is unclear because a well-done study showed little difference between yearly or every 2 year mammograms in women ages 50-69. the age to start mammograms is also unclear. for women under 50 it takes 1 904 mammograms to prevent one death from breast cancer. most groups recommend starting at age 40 but ask your doctor to explain your personal risks and benefits based on your history. get your question answered live by a real doctor › disclaimer
how can i detect breast cancer early?
if +fm hx prior chest irradiation or child hood malignancy as early as age 20 but 30-40 for others. also you need to learn your breast and self exam for changes. if you find something time for professional confirmation. mammo annual age 40.
how can i detect breast cancer early?
monthly self breast examinations yearly physical examination with your doctor and yearly mammogram starting age 40. any additional testing could include breast ultrasound or mri depending on what the above examinations showed first.
hormone replacement therapy. estrogen alone increases risk of uterine cancer. adding progesterone increases risk of breast cancer but reduces risk of uterine cancer. what's the right balance?
yes estrogen alone does increase the risk of uterine cancer over time. and yes the whi showed that the combination of a certain synthetic estrogen and a certain synthetic progestin increased the risk of breast cancer. but most specialists do not use those older types of synthetic hormones and with newer medications the risks are lower and different. so a balance can be achieved.
how can i tell if my breast lump is a breast cancer?
the only way to know is to get it checked. mammography or ultrasound may show the answer or you may need a biopsy for unknown or questionable lumps. most can be diagnosed with a core needle biopsy which does not require going to surgery. talk to your doctor to see what is best for you.
how can i tell if my breast lump is a breast cancer?
an experienced gynecologist or breast surgeon can often tell if there is a high chance that it is malignant or if it is likely benign. regardless any lump needs to be evaluated with a mammogram and possibly an ultrasound. it should also be biopsied.
how can i help my partner cope with a breast cancer diagnosis?
dealing with breast cancer is traumatic for all. make sure your partner doesn't forget to take care of themself. let them know that you support them no matter what you have to go through. remind them that you will go through it together. good luck.
how can i help my partner cope with a breast cancer diagnosis?
breast cancer is a tragic diagnosis to patient family and friends and every one has to cope up with it treatments are getting better each day. she need to seek professional help including you if needed arrange for cosmetic reconstruction. give all the moral help she needs and deserves. i hope i helped you.
how is breast cancer distinguished from lumpy breasts?
some breast cancers can only be detected on mammogram/ultrasound/mri. it is important for you to perform your own self exam (bse) every month. your goal is to get to know your "lumpiness" so you can detect something that feels different.
how is breast cancer distinguished from lumpy breasts?
as a breast surgeon a significant part of my practice is devoted to this dilemma. self-examination definitely helps finding cancers but can be very difficult since most women have "lumpy bumpy" breasts; breast examination supplemented by ultrasound is the best way to distinguish the two. other tools including needle (aspiration) biopsy mammography or even mri may sometimes be helpful.
how can i tell if a breast lump is a gland or node or not?
although breast cancer lumps tend to be hard and fixed to the chest wall there are many exceptions in early cancers. don't try to "guess" if it is cancer or not- see a md for an accurate assessment.
has anyone had or heard of a genetic test you can have to see if you are at risk for breast cancer?
we can test forcertaintypes of hereditary breast cancer caused by the brca genes 1 and 2. there is also a test for lynch syndrome that causes increased risk of polyposis colorectal cancer breast and uterine cancer. tests are available for li fraumeni which is very rare. we think that more (and cheaper) genetic testing will be available in the next several years.
has anyone had or heard of a genetic test you can have to see if you are at risk for breast cancer?
the brca test is a simple blood test that can determine if someone carries a mutation that puts them at high risk for developing breast and/or ovarian cancer. in general we advise testing the member of the family who had cancer first & then testing others who want the test only if a mutation was found. remember:most breast cancers are not hereditary. check link in comments to see if you qualify.
how can i tell if a breast lump is cancer?
although breast cancer lumps tend to be hard and fixed to the chest wall there are many exceptions in early cancers. don't try to "guess" if it is cancer or not- see a md for an accurate assessment.
how can i tell if a breast lump is cancer?
the very fact that you are concerned makes it highly-probable that biopsy is appropriate. a majority of women will have a breast biopsy during their lifetime and if it's picked up early breast cancer is almost 100% curable. ignored it's invariably fatal. i'm glad you've chosen to take a proactive approach to your health -- keep up the "take charge" attitude and good luck.
how does herceptin (trastuzumab) work?
described by dr. clifford hudis in nejm in 2007. it can reduce her2 signaling it can recruit cells to directly kill cancer cells. her2 can activate a protein called p95. herceptin (trastuzumab) can block this thereby reduce signaling leading to cell death. it is a multifaceted medication so this is why it is probably the most important drug in her2 positive breast cancer. hope this helps.
how much tamoxifen is recommended?
tamoxifen is most commonly used to treat breast cancer. the dose is (usually) 20mg per day and taken for 5 years. this medication is also used for people considered "high risk" for breast cancer to help decrease their risk of developing it in the future. i recommend you speak with your oncologist about specific recommendations for your case.
how can you tell if breast pain is cystic or cancer?
imaging with help. typically breast pain is not a symptom of breast cancer.
how to tell difference between gyno and breast cancer?
gynecomastia right? you probably want it removed surgically; the pathologist will take a look at it and you'll know for sure. symmetric enlargement under a man's nipples is almost always gynecomastia; if it ulcerates or keep growing or is invading then it's time for biopsy or wide excision.
hormonal effects of chemotherapy for breast cancer?
it is unclear from your question what you are asking. most breast cancers are estrogen-sensitive and can be treated with anti-estrogen medication (tamoxifen aromatase inhibitors). many women who are peri menopausal when receiving traditional chemotherapy develop ovarian suppression from the chemo and effectively "go into" menopause. i hope this helps.
how long would i have to take estrogen before i start worrying bout breast cancer.?
it has been shown that using hormone replacement therapy (hrt) can increase one's risk of breast cancer when taken for longer than 5 years. because of this we no longer recommend taking hormones for long periods of time. work with your gynecologist for options to deal with the symptoms of menopause.
how can doctors tell if i have breast cancer?
doctors diagnose breast cancer by taking a history and doing a physical exam and looking at mammograms and breast ultrasounds the tissue diagnosis is made after a biopsy which takes a small piece of a mass and examines it under a microscope.
how exactly can breast feeding lower the risk of breast cancer?
breast feeding has been shown to be a factor that is associated with a lower risk of breast cancer the cause if this effect is most likely hormonal as estrogen levels are one of the factors that increase the risk of breast cancer.
how exactly can breast feeding lower the risk of breast cancer?
epidemiological studies have shown multiple factors associated with lower risks for breast cancer in women who have had fewer periods (late puberty early menopause pregnancy esp@early age breastfeeding). we think this has to do with estrogen exposure but its probably not that simple.
i'm 30 y. o with giant fibroadenoma (6-7cm). need advise urgently?
a breast cancer specialist can help you to get this problem handled. you may need surgery to remove this lump as it can be cancerous. it is hard to tell without a biopsy of this lesion.
i have a friend that has stage 2 breast cancer her surgeon says he might have to operate a least three times. why is that?
probably your friend is having mastectomy with breast reconstruction. to reconstruct the breast you do the surgery to remove the breast then a surgery to place an expander under the skin to stretch it and then a final surgery to but in an implant. most patients only need one surgery though (a lumpectomy) followed by radiation.
instead of having a mammogram i have to have ultra sounds. what could be the reason for this?
mammogram is the standard first test to screen for breast cancer. an ultrasound can often add to its value especially if your breast are dense (increased density on the mammograms).
i'm wondering what are the common symptoms of breast cancer?
can include a mass. masses that are painless irregular ; hard are more suggestive of cancer but they can also be tender painful ; soft. swelling of breast; thickened red skin; non-milky nipple discharge; new retraction of nipple puckering or irritation of skin or pain ; sometimes swollen lymph nodes under arm(s). seek med eval if you have suspicious symptoms.
i just had a breast biopsy they gave me a sheet have 20% of the chance i will have breast cancer what does this mean?
a general statement that approximately 20% of breast biopsies are positive across the board. it is likely not tailored to your specific situation.
i just had a breast biopsy they gave me a sheet have 20% of the chance i will have breast cancer what does this mean?
20 out of 100 patients will have cancer and the other 80 will not have cancer.
i just had a breast biopsy they gave me a sheet have 20% of the chance i will have breast cancer what does this mean?
perhaps there is a misunderstanding. maybe 20% of breast biopsies show up cancer the majority of which are cured. however in your case you either have breast cancer or you don't -- and some lumps are much more worrisome than others. hence "odds" mean nothing to you as an individual. anticipate either good news or an early warning that you can hope will save your life.
i need your expertise is 16 years old to young to get breast cancer?
likely at this age. are there significant risk factors? factors include: being female increasing age genetics family history of breast cancer previous breast cancer being caucasian dense breast tissue some previous benign breast conditions never having given birth or 1st child after age 30 early menarche late menopause radiation (chest) exposure to diethylstilbestrol hormone.
i need to know what is the obsession with breast cancer awareness?
you termed it - is that breast cancer can be screened for. it can also be treated (with variable results). breast cancer kills men ; women. most of us don't desire to die tragically early or tragically painfully - nor would we wish that on loved ones. what you called obsession can also be viewed as support education ; empowerment.
i need to know what is the cause of ductal carcinoma in situ (dcis)?
this is mostly a random event. there's a natural instability in the human genome even if you are never exposed to anything that's obviously a mutagen. the other factors that place you at risk for breast cancer (nulliparity brca1 / brca2 mutations etc. ) are risk factors here but no woman (and actually no man either) is immune.
is it possible to have breast cancer if i don't have a tumor?
the tumor could be seen as calcifications seen on mammgrams or could be like early pget's disease.

is it possible to get breast cancer from wearing a sports bra?
the type of clothing you wear is not a risk factor in developing breast cancer. risk factors for developing breast cancer include but are not limited to female gender age strong family history of breast cancer and certain medications. if you have breast pain a breast lump nipple discharge or other concerns then see your doctor!
im 18 and have one inverted nipple that itches can it be breast cancer!?
always been inverted - that is likely your anatomy. breast cancer risk is quite low at age 18. however if these are new changes - have them medically assessed.

you mean by "low numbers". if you truly had a stage 3 node negative cancer it would be a t4n0m0 (stage iiib). being er+ is good but a grade 3 stage 3 still has a fair risk of relapse. you need an aggressive approach with chemo surgery radiation and endocrine therapy. my advise: do your best to complete therapy and do not focus too much in numbers or odds. best 2u.

if you can feel the lump that means a doctor could easily do a needle biopsy with the help of an ultrasound. that's the only way to know for sure. i agree with dr. hoover that this is most likely a fibroadenoma. it's been there a long time and doesn't sound like it's grown which makes it unlikely to be cancer. still a biopsy may put your mind at ease!

at age 19 a painless lump in your breast that has been present for a long time and is not changing is probably not of concern. it is likely a fibroadenoma or other totally benign mass. with that said you should be evaluated by a breast specialist to be certain that it should not be removed. it is probably unrelated to the pcos.

we usually wait at least 4-6 wks after the last chemotherapy before proceeding with breast reconstruction. it usually takes that long for your immune system to recover from the chemo. having surgery if your immune system is still low increases the risk of infection and poor healing. if radiation is also planned as part of your breast cancer treatment this can delay breast reconstruction further.

we are not able to control most risk factors for breast cancer such as being female aging and family history. we can control our weight as obesity is linked to an increased risk of breast cancer. limit your alcohol intake have babies breast feed and increase your physical activity. in addition we can perform routine screening. early detection leads to the best chance of a cure.
how can one reduce the chance of getting breast cancer?
the best things you can do include avoiding estrogen-progesterone pills smoking and radiation exposure. exercise a healthy low-fat diet and avoidance of alcohol will further reduce the risk. a summary of a recent epidemiological study can be found below: <link>
how can one reduce the chance of getting breast cancer?
there is no absolute prevention but abstain from caffine maintain a vegitarian diet stay away from "artificial" sweetners flavoring agents. get as much fresh air and exercise. absolutely abstain from alcohol and tobacco!
how do you screen for breast cancer in patients who have already had a mastectomy?
the mainstay of surveillance for breast cancer in a mastectomized breast is frequent physical exam by a physician. i examine my patients every 6 months for the first five years after mastectomy. it is also important to continue getting mammograms annually in the non-mastectomized breast.
how do you screen for breast cancer in patients who have already had a mastectomy?
through physical exams and sometimes imaging. have a mastectomy does not take your risk of having breast cancer to 0%.
how do you know if you are a candidate for breast reconstruction surgery?
breast reconstruction is needed for trauma disease or congenital absence of breast. the most obvious need for breast reconstruction is for breast reconstruction following mastectomy for breast cancer. your insurance company will allow breast reconstruction for medical issues; you can check with them to see if you are a candidate.
how long is the chemotherapy for a stage 2a node negative breast cancer?
there are several chemotherapy options for stage 2a breast cancer. characteristics of the patient and the cancer are required to make a decision on the type of chemotherapy (and whether chemotherapy is even necessary). chemotherapy would be anywhere from about 8 weeks to a year (herceptin-or trastuzumab treatment if recommended requires a year of treatment).
how long is the chemotherapy for a stage 2a node negative breast cancer?
will depend on the chemotherapy regimen chosen the age of patient other prognostic factors i. e oncotype dx to see the recurrence score heart function etc. . in general we give 4 cycles of adjuvant chemotherapy when we use tc or ac. however discuss in detail with your oncologist. this is something that you want to know prior to therapy- what kind how long what is the goal side effects etc.
how would you know if you have breast cancer?
needs physical examination and likely mammogram with possible breast ultrasound depending on the woman's age and physical exam findings.
how would you know if you have breast cancer?
breast cancer usually presents as a painless lump in the breast. this can be detected by the patient if she knows how to look for it and do breast self examination. if you suspect something you should go to your doctor and ask for a clinical breast examination. he/she may do a mammogram to confirm the lump and often have to do a biopsy if a lump is discovered. biopsy is the final proof of cancer.
how long can a person live with stage 4 breast cancer that metastasized to the bone?
by definition breast cancer that has metastasized to the bone is stage iv. depending on the patient's overall health and response to therapy can live many years.
how long can a person live with stage 4 breast cancer that metastasized to the bone?
if the bones are the only site of breast cancer metastasis a person potentially can liver for many years. if the cancer involves other organs the survival is about 1 1/2=2 years.
how effective is xeloda (capecitabine) for metastatic breast cancer?
as the first treatment for metastatic breast cancer xeloda (capecitabine) works in 40-60% of people treated. if it is the second third or later treatment after failure of other agents the effectiveness is much less.
how effective is xeloda (capecitabine) for metastatic breast cancer?
xeloda(capecitabine) is a commonly used drug for treating metastatic breast cancer. like other single drugs it helps to control the cancer for several months when used all by itself. so often it can be used in combination with another chemotherapy agent. together it can add to the usefulness of other drugs. it certainly ranks number 3 or 4 among the best drugs available for treating breast cancer.
i was wondering what are some signs of breast cancer?
presence of a new lump an area of unusual thickening new changes in the nipple such as retraction inversion ulceration or discharge skin changes such as thickening redness dimpling breast swelling enlarged nodes in the axilla are all signs to raise concerns and need to be evaluated by a health care provider. mammogram or other breast imaging may also detect findings suggestive of cancer.
i was wondering what are some signs of breast cancer?
usually there are no specific signs that is why screening and preventive measures are highly recommended. most people have no symptoms but may find a lump.
i am 39yrs old had mammogram 4/10/10came back normal. when should i have another mammogram? both my grandma's had breast cancer.
unless your grandmothers had breast cancer at an early age you should have your next mammogram at age 40. you should have them yearly thereafter.
i am 39yrs old had mammogram 4/10/10came back normal. when should i have another mammogram? both my grandma's had breast cancer.
begin annual screening at 40 so your next screening mammo should be in a year.
i am 39yrs old had mammogram 4/10/10came back normal. when should i have another mammogram? both my grandma's had breast cancer.
yearly mammograms are reasonable. frequent self examinations are your most valuable screening test.
if one has breast cancer can it go into lungs and spread there?
breast cancer can spread to virtually any site in the body including the lungs. most common is spread to lymph nodes in the armpit which are commonly removed with the primary tumor. next most common is spread to bones(25%) lung (20%) brain and liver (15% each). cure becomes less likely with spread to other organs but is not impossible and patients can live for many years with spread.
if one has breast cancer can it go into lungs and spread there?
metastases from breast cancers can go to the lungs.
is it true that early stage of breast cancer is painful?
it isn't.
i had a mammogram and ultrasound and result in mail we're clear but doctors office was persistent that i keep appointment with breast cancer spec why?
doctor feel something abnormal on exam? a small % of cancers are not seen on mammo/ultrasound and are found only on exam. speak with your doc about why you need to see the specialist.
i had a mammogram and ultrasound and result in mail we're clear but doctors office was persistent that i keep appointment with breast cancer spec why?
i am assuming that you have seen your primary care doc who was concerned about something felt in your breast(s) and ordered a mammogram and ultrasound. negative imaging studies do not rule out a malignancy. you should definitely see a breast cancer specialist but hopefully all will be fine.
i had a mammogram and ultrasound and result in mail we're clear but doctors office was persistent that i keep appointment with breast cancer spec why?
your doctor may have a clinical concern based on your clinical exam and history. negative mammogram and ultrasound do not completely rule out breast abnormalities including breast cancer. i would suggest follow up as your doctor recommended.
is massive pleural effusion in one lung high risk for mastectomy for breast cancer?
a large pleural effusion in the setting of malignancy is worrisome for metastatic spread.
is massive pleural effusion in one lung high risk for mastectomy for breast cancer?
the cause of pleural effusion has to be determined whether it is reactive may have been due to heart or treatment received or spread of disease wherein a different treatment modality may be considered or infectious wherein immunomodulating treatments and surgeries may have to be delayed.
is herceptin (trastuzumab) just can heal breast cancer?
herceptin (trastuzumab) is approved for the treatment of early-stage breast cancer that is human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-positive (her2+) and has spread into the lymph nodes or is her2+ and has not spread into the lymph nodes. if it has not spread into the lymph nodes the cancer needs to be estrogen receptor/progesterone receptor (er/pr)-negative or have one high risk feature.
is herceptin (trastuzumab) just can heal breast cancer?
certain types of cancers called her 2 + cancers in those cancers her protein stimulates cancers cells trastuzumab ( herceptin ) a monoclonal antibody interferes at receptor site cancer cell multiplication ( in way you can call it ' heal breast cancer ' in layman terms )
i am 48 menopaused and suffering from symptoms. am i at high risk if i take hrt knowing that i have 2 aunts diagnosed with breast cancer (at old age)?
long term hrt does increase the risk of developing breast cancer. however the risk goes up by a small degree and that too only after prolonged use(5 or more years). short term hrt is commonly used in those who have severe menopausal symptoms which may be debilitating. go seek advice from your gynecologist.
i am 48 menopaused and suffering from symptoms. am i at high risk if i take hrt knowing that i have 2 aunts diagnosed with breast cancer (at old age)?
are at higher risk if you use hrt. you should discuss benefits risks alternatives with your gynecologist. not all breast cancers are stimulated by estrogens but not all hot flashes are worth the increased risk.
is stage two breast cancer curable?
according to the american cancer society the 5 year relative survival rate for stage 1 is 100% stage ii- 93% stage iii is 72% and stage iv is 22%.
i was diagnosed on stage 1 breast cancer what to do?
preferably in the setting of a multidisciplinary team. stage i is usually very curable but you need treatment that may include surgery radiation chemotherapy or hormone therapy. it depends on the circumstances. god bless fight well and don't give up.
i have a breast lump (1cm diameter) under my right nipple and it feels a little sore when i feel it. i'm a 24 year old male. can this be cancerous?
breast cancers are rare in men but still 1 % breast cancers are in men tend to diagnosed late at you age is unlikely but still need to be checked by your doctor
i have a breast lump (1cm diameter) under my right nipple and it feels a little sore when i feel it. i'm a 24 year old male. can this be cancerous?
men can have breast tissue develop breast lumps and even breast cancer. most likely it is gynecomastia - male breast tissue - given your age. your doctor can evaluate this and direct you in the proper treatment.
i have had gynecomastia for over a year. it was attributed to finesteride which i stopped 6 months ago. tenderness persists on 1side. is this unusual?
yes few develop gynecomastia in 3 % when discontinued may or may not reverse to normal size also slight increased incidence of male breast cancer. make sure to see your doctor if needed get a biopsy done
i a patient has breast cancer when would you give radiation therapy?
radiation therapy is used for localized breast cancer. radiation alone is not a curative treatment for breast cancer. in breast cancer it is used as an additional (adjuvant) treatment to treat local and regional areas at high husk for microscopic disease. it's use depends on stage and what type of surgery had been performed. for more information cancer. gov cancer. org astro. org nccn. org.
i have fibrodenoma last 2 years. now there is pinching pain sometimes. what does it means? is it changing into breast cancer?
if your doctor is absolutely sure that you have a fibroadenoma and nothing more. in general breast cancer is uncommon at your age fibroadenoma does not turn into cancer and cancers are not painful. but these are general statements and exceptions occur frequently. best to see your doctor for specific advice about your case.
i have fibrodenoma last 2 years. now there is pinching pain sometimes. what does it means? is it changing into breast cancer?
fibroadenoma's are benign and rarely become malignant. most malignancies of the breast present as a painless lump. seems very unlikely.
i have fibrodenoma last 2 years. now there is pinching pain sometimes. what does it means? is it changing into breast cancer?
breast fibroadenomas are a common benign nodule that does not become cancerous. have you already had a biopsy to confirm it is benign? pain is also rarely a sign of breast cancer ; breast pain is more commonly associated with fibrocystic breast discomfort around the menstrual cycle. see a doctor for an exam to be sure there are no concerns.
i have been prescribed cerazette because my mother had breast cancer and have been taking for over two years now. is this the correct diagnosis?
cerazette has only progestogen with out estrogen as in common combined birth control pill less clotting problems could be used during breast feeding still has very slight risk of breast cancer if this is the issue why don't you adapt non medication b c like iud. speak to your doctor
i am about to get tested for the breast cancer gene. if positive should i get a mastectomy?
decision that should be made by an on-line doctor who does not know you or your personal history. that is a very individual decision that should be made carefully with full information about risks with and without surgery.
if a brca 1-2 test comes back positive is a bilateral mastectomy the best option?
the "best" option is a personal choice. options to lower breast cancer risk for patients with a brca1 or brca2 mutation include: -bilateral mastectomy which removes most but not all of the breast cells and reduces risk the most (by 90-95%) -breast mri and mammogram does not reduce risk but finds breast cancer early when it is more treatable -chemoprevention to prevent getting breast cancer
if a brca 1-2 test comes back positive is a bilateral mastectomy the best option?
at 41 your risk of breast cancer with brca is up to 90% of getting breast cancer. you are at a 65% risk of developing a 2nd breast cancer. i highly recommend you go to a breast center and speak with a genetic counselor breast surgeon and medical oncologist about your options. if you choose mastectomy you may be a candidate for a nipple sparing with reconstruction.
if a brca 1-2 test comes back positive is a bilateral mastectomy the best option?
bilateral mastectomies are one option but so is increased surveillance with yearly mammos and breast mris together with chemo prevention with tamoxifen. if the patient has ovaries they should come out after completion of childbearing. that will reduce the risk of both ovarian cancer and (in premenopausal women) of breast cancer too. if this is about you please see a genetic counselor. best 2u!
i discovered a breast lump. i'm 19 weeks pregnant and i found a hard bb size breast lump.?
majority of breast lumps are benign but some are cancerous. breast cancers may be found during pregnany as other times. please have your breast lump checked by a breast care provider. an ultrasound can be done safely which is very helpful in determining what steps are needed to be taken.
i had fibroadenoma in 2009. in 2013 i found a cyst in the same breast. are these risk factors for cancer? a cyst can degenerate? thanks
simple cysts of the breast are harmless and "degeneration" has nothing to do with malignant change. having had a fibroadenoma does put you at slightly greater statistical lifetime risk for breast cancer but you'd simply do well to keep up surveillance not ignoring self-exams. you mention abdominal obesity fitness and weight loss may help you reduce your risk as well. best wishes.
i had fibroadenoma in 2009. in 2013 i found a cyst in the same breast. are these risk factors for cancer? a cyst can degenerate? thanks
benign conditions of the breast like you have mentioned are quite common. yet over 90% of such women will remain well and free of breast cancer. so you should quit worrying about breast cancer. yet you should have an annual breast examination by your doctor. once you get past 40 years of age mammography can be added to your annual check ups. that is about all you need to know and do. good luck.
is opsoclonus-myoclonus-ataxia a genetic problem if coming from breast cancer. my gran got it after breast cancer. i have autoimmune problems and was wondering if it is a one off thing or genetic.
most often associated with childhood hemangioblastoma but can be seen with other conditions on a far less frequent basis. likely not a clearcut autoimmune condition but more likely secondary to a paraneoplastic effect of a tumor essentially a toxic response at a distance. hard to say if truly genetic susceptibility and unlikely that you might be at risk.
is opsoclonus-myoclonus-ataxia a genetic problem if coming from breast cancer. my gran got it after breast cancer. i have autoimmune problems and was wondering if it is a one off thing or genetic.
i'm sorry about your grandmother and i am glad you are taking a proactive approach to your health. the syndrome you describe is usually due to anti-ri antibodies that attack a breast cancer and cross-react with some of the cells in the nervous system. if you do not have breast cancer this is not a risk and i've seen nothing to make me think that having other autoimmune disease puts you at risk.
i have breast cancer in the family and high risk. offered double mastectomy should i get it?
but not enough info to say. if you had proper counseling and your risk is very high (eg. brca mutation or other significant risk factors) mastectomies are an option but some patients can do ok with increased surveillance (mris) plus preventative tamoxifen or even removal of the ovaries. there are too many unknowns for me to answer properly. make sure you see someone with expertise in this area.
i have observed that in my right breast near yo underarms i feel the nerve has been swollen. is it a sign of breast cancer?
all women should have their breast examined once every 2-3 years. this is advised to all women over the age of 21 years. it is called a clinical breast examination(cbe). if you have not had one done during the last one year now is a good time to go see your doctor and let him/her examine the underarm and your breast for any lumps.
i'm 24 years old is it harmful using deodorant as my mother died because of breast cancer at age 45? i heard deodorant causes/ leads breast cancer
i am so sorry to hear about your mother. that must have been extremely difficult for you. it is still ok to use deodorant. do make sure that you examine your breasts regularly and insist that your doctor do the same. even in the us doctors are often too perfunctory in their breast examinations. with a family history of early breast cancer you cannot afford that.
i'm 24 years old is it harmful using deodorant as my mother died because of breast cancer at age 45? i heard deodorant causes/ leads breast cancer
there is no clinical evidence that deodorant can cause breast cancer. your mother died at age 45 of breast cancer and will be critical for you to have a close follow up. you need to be tested for brca-1 brca2 and have initial examination of your breast including imaging and a baseline mri with contrast. when possible.
i'm 24 years old is it harmful using deodorant as my mother died because of breast cancer at age 45? i heard deodorant causes/ leads breast cancer
i actually traced down that story when it came out as an e-mail. it was made up by a guy who was trying to sell a "natural" deodorant. if you don't use deodorant you can end up losing your job and they don't tell you the real reason. don't let a shameless liar ruin your life. <link>
i have breast cancer and lymphoma i'm frantic what to do?
find yourself a good oncologist if you don't have one already and make sure he/she answers your questions to the best of his/her ability. sometimes we have to tell patients what they don't want to hear but in my experience knowing what's going on is beneficial to patients. truly wish you the best.
i keep hearing about the 5 year survival rate of breast cancer. why 5 years? what is the survival rate after 5 years?
5-year survivals are usually emphasized because it is hard to follow patients after five years and because for most cancers the recurrence rate after five years in negligible. unfortunately the risk of breast cancer recurring from 5-10 years after treatment is only marginally lower than the risk of recurrence in the first five years after treatment. early breast cancer recurrence does drop.
i have pain in my left armpit and i feel a tiny lump in my left breast. the lump is painful when i press on it. could this be breast cancer?
trying to guess - it is best to have the lump medically evaluated.
i have pain in my left armpit and i feel a tiny lump in my left breast. the lump is painful when i press on it. could this be breast cancer?
without an exam and proper evaluation it is impossible to tell. see your doctor as soon as possible.
is it safe for breast cancer survivor to use victoza (liraglutide) for diabetes because the drug has thyroid cancer risk? i am worried.
the stuff causes overgrowth of c-cells in the thyroid in rodents but the risk for humans is probably negligible / primarily in the minds of the lawyers. nobody's got even a theoretical risk to breast cancer.
is it safe for breast cancer survivor to use victoza (liraglutide) for diabetes because the drug has thyroid cancer risk? i am worried.
victoza (liraglutide) is shown to cause medullary thyroid cancer (very rare cancer in humans)in rats. . human incidence not known. no association with breast cancer.
is it safe for breast cancer survivor to use victoza (liraglutide) for diabetes because the drug has thyroid cancer risk? i am worried.
there is an extremely small theoretic risk of getting a very rare type of thyroid cancer called medullary thyroid cancer. this possibility was really only noted in rats during investigation of the drug. no increased incidence of this cancer has been found in people. it is a very effective and useful medication for diabetes. the benefits greatly outweigh any small risk of cancer.
i have these acne like bumps on both of my breast that are a little more deeper in the skin than normal bumps. where is it come from? mammogram needed?
having acne-like bumps on both breasts is not breast cancer. a dermatologist might be able to help determine what these are but don't worry! what you describe is not breast cancer and it would be very rare to happen in a 21-year-old. breast cancer starts in one breast not both. i'm glad you're paying attention though!
i am having a very painful stabbing sensation in my breast. can this be breast cancer?
many breast cancers do not cause pain in the breast though some do. usually breast pain is the result of some type of inflammation such as fibrocystic condition mastitis breast infection or breast cysts among many causes. a medical evaluation is needed to rule out a more significant pathology such as breast cancer.
i'm having reconstructive breast surgery d/t breast cancer. any ideas on what i should expect?
much of what you should expect will depend on exactly what is done. therefore best to discuss the planned procedure as well as what to expect afterwards with your plastic surgeon directly. best wishes for a successful procedure/outcome.
i'm having reconstructive breast surgery d/t breast cancer. any ideas on what i should expect?
if you having expanders placed then it is slightly painful and sore for a few days to 2 weeks. if you are having a bigger procedure like a tram or free flap then it is a little more discomfort at the incision sites and there may be more bruising.
is it invasive lymph node metastasis is serious condition for breast cancer? is it curable?
of breast cancer can be considered serious but to answer your question yes breast cancer with lymph node involvement is potentially curable but the probability depends on a number of factors. survival rates are very high if the tumor is small and the lymph node involvement is minimal(stage 1b) and become worse with increasing tumor size extent of node involvement and distant metastases.
is it invasive lymph node metastasis is serious condition for breast cancer? is it curable?
lymph nodes are the 2nd line of defense against the spread of breast cancer after the 1st line the immune system lets some cells slip by. many will have the cancer trapped for a while by the nodes preventing the spread and removal of the nodes can be curative. if there is no evidence of the cancer elsewhere in the body the nodes may have worked well. check with your oncologist.
i have bite sized lumps on them also. could this be breast cancer?
it's possible for your age. professionally history physical exam with mammogram and biopsy as needed will help. as to the sequence of care please talk and work with your attending physician coherently and timely. best luck.
is inflamatory breast cancer diagnosed visually?
there are certain visual clues on physical exam which may raise suspicion for an inflammatory breast cancer. however like all other breast cancers the definitive diagnosis of inflammatory breast cancer is made with a biopsy. for inflammatory breast cancer it's important that the biopsy includes the skin in the area.
is inflamatory breast cancer diagnosed visually?
no definitive diagnosis of breast cancer is done by biopsy.
i am a breast cancer survivor (diagnosed in 2000). on my last blood test my lymphocyte% was 23% and sodium was 135 should i be concerned?
probably no those are normal variants unrelated to that cancer.
ibc inflammatory breast cancer what is this?
it is an aggressive form of breast cancer that presents with pain swelling and redness of the breast instead of the usual painless mass. requires intensive treatment with preoperative chemo followed by surgery and radiation. i usually scan patients with this to see if the cancer has already spread. if this is about you you need to start therapy pronto. don't despair just get it going.
can mammograms miss breast cancer 5 years in a row?
if you have dense breasts that are difficult to read with mammograms or a very slow growing tumor it is possible but unlikely. it is important to combine a mammogram with a breast exam by your health care provider and your own monthly breast self exam. make sure you are getting digital mammograms.
can mammograms miss breast cancer 5 years in a row?
usually if you had mammogram 5 yrs in a row it would detect something assuming it was done and read properly but not all cancers are always seen on mammography.
can mammograms miss breast cancer 5 years in a row?
i'm not exactly sure what you are asking but it is important to note that mammography is not perfect and it can miss cancer especially when the breasts are dense. about 15% of cancers dont show on mamm. so if you have a lump particularly if the lump is getting bigger the fact that the mammogram is negative does not completely rule out cancer. and ultrasound or possibly a biopsy may be needed.
could male breast cancer reoccur in the thyroid after eight years of mastectomy radiotherapy and chemotherapy?
unlikely but breast cancer can go anywhere. primary thyroid cancer would be much more likely.
could male breast cancer reoccur in the thyroid after eight years of mastectomy radiotherapy and chemotherapy?
this would be an unusual place for recurrence of male breast cancer to recur. often ct scans or other studies will show a lesion in the thyroid that is unrelated. i would check with my oncologist.
ct scan shows small calcific densities measuring 3. 5mm in the right lobe of thyroid gland. any suggestions on what this could be please? i had breast cancer in 08 but no mestateses and n full remission w br ca. tysvm! i love you guys.
thyroid calcifications are relatively common. some of them are an indication of thyroid cancer. the first thing to do is to get a neck ultrasound which is better than ct in visualizing the thyroid and thyroid function tests.
ct scan shows small calcific densities measuring 3. 5mm in the right lobe of thyroid gland. any suggestions on what this could be please? i had breast cancer in 08 but no mestateses and n full remission w br ca. tysvm! i love you guys.
killed the cat and satisfaction costs false positives and findings we do not need to know about. unlike mamograms where calcium poit the way to cancer in breast these tiny calcifications are meaningles in thyroid. may indicate "burnt out" thyroiditis. check t-3 tsh maybe u/s but not related to breast ca. probably nothing. you do not need screening ct 4 years out from br ca.
ct scan shows small calcific densities measuring 3. 5mm in the right lobe of thyroid gland. any suggestions on what this could be please? i had breast cancer in 08 but no mestateses and n full remission w br ca. tysvm! i love you guys.
these are likely benign. microcalcifications less than 1 mm can be psamoma bodies associated with papillary thyroid cancer. with your history and known association between breast and thyroid cancers i would at least get an ultrasound guided biopsy of it.
ct scan shows small calcific densities measuring 3. 5mm in the right lobe of thyroid gland. any suggestions on what this could be please? i had breast cancer in 08 but no mestateses and n full remission w br ca. tysvm! i love you guys.
these likely represent small thyroid nodules. calcification is more concerning for the possibility of cancer. the nodules are very small. they may require biopsy however especially given the history. see a board-certified endocrinologist.
can the intake of tamoxifen for breast cancer affect our uterus?
yes! tamoxifen is a quirky drug! it binds to the estrogen receptor on cells and in most places blocks the activity of estrogen. but in some places including the uterus tamoxifen turns on the receptor instead of turning it off. this causes the lining of the uterus to build up and get thick. this slightly increases the risk of uterine cancer especially in older women.
can the intake of tamoxifen for breast cancer affect our uterus?
tamoxifen can stimulate the utermine lining can cause abnormal menstrual type bleeding and could be a risk factor for uternine cancer. the benefits far outweight the risks though. tamoxifen can also increase the risk of blood clots but lowers osteoporosis risk.
could breast cancer manifest as pain below the breast?
while pain is not a usual symptom of breast cancer it is possible. most breast cancers do no have any symptoms at all.
could breast cancer manifest as pain below the breast?
most early breast cancers are asymptomatic. pain below the breast is likely to be due to other reasons. if it is under the left breast it may reflect heart problem. please discuss the issue with your doctor at the next visit.
can breast cancer be spotted through a chest ct scan?
a mammogram and ultrasound ate the best way to diagnose a breast mass. however a ct scan may show a obvious large mass or asymmetry in the breast tissue which may lead to a mammogram. a ct scan also may show enlarged lymph nodes which may be a clue.
can breast cancer be spotted through a chest ct scan?
but the lesion would have to be large enough to be visualized. a mammogram is a much superior means to evaluate the breast.
can breast cancer be spotted through a chest ct scan?
yes though that is not the test of choice. a chest ct will usually spot breast cancer as an incidental finding. it is not as sensitive as a mammogram or ultrasound of the breast.
can breast cancer cause pain swelling in both breasts?
pain in both breasts is usually benign but like anything else should be checked out if it persistent.
can you still get breast augmentation with abnormal mammogram?
breast augmentation does not increase or decrease the risk of breast cancer but can require a slight variation in mammography technique (ecklund or displacement technique) and an additional view or two. but if you already have an abnormal test get this concluded and then proceed to elective surgery with full health and no worry!
could my breast cancer have been caused by the unhealthy environment i lived in for two years? small lump started before i moved from the apartment and now its the size of my palm (red and irritated too) it started 9 months ago. no history of any cancer
do you have an actual diagnosis of breast cancer from a biopsy? or are you describing what you see and feel? breast infection can be firm tender and red. but the rare condition of an inflammatory breast cancer can be a serious condition. environmental conditions do not cause sudden cancer formation but infections can be related to unclean situations.
could my breast cancer have been caused by the unhealthy environment i lived in for two years? small lump started before i moved from the apartment and now its the size of my palm (red and irritated too) it started 9 months ago. no history of any cancer
while it is true that as many as 90% of all breast cancers are environmental in origin it is difficult if not impossible to identify the specific cause of your cancer. regardless once diagnosed breast cancer is eminently treatable. left untreated it will continue to grow. please seek out medical care if you haven't already done so. good luck.
could my breast cancer have been caused by the unhealthy environment i lived in for two years? small lump started before i moved from the apartment and now its the size of my palm (red and irritated too) it started 9 months ago. no history of any cancer
one factor is family history of this disease like if a sister and mother also had it. these cancers are hormone dependent so early menarche late menopause and late/no term pregnancies are at increased risk. dietary fat intake may also be a risk factor. but the environment you lived in is highly unlikely to have done this. more likely is that you should've seen your dr. so see dr. asap.
could premerin homone replacement cause paget breast cancer?
we think that combined hormone replacement including estrogen and progesterone cause an increase in breast cancer of which paget's disease if the breast is a type. premarin (conjugated estrogens) only contains estrogen.
could my daughter have breast cancer at 14?
breast cancer is extremely rare in 14 year old women. the more common cause of a breast mass or lump is a fibroadenoma. if she has a lump to feel she should see a breast surgeon and make the diagnosis and take care of it.
could my daughter have breast cancer at 14?
breast cancer at age 14 would be extremely unlikely. most often breast firmness with swelling & discomfort is from hormonal changes & puberty and sometimes fibrocystic nodules. see your family doctor or pediatrician for an examination.
can herceptin (trastuzumab) be used for other types of cancer?
in addition to breast cancer herceptin (trastuzumab) is now also used for stomach cancers that carry the her2 protein.
can herceptin (trastuzumab) be used for other types of cancer?
herceptin (trastuzumab) is a her2neu inhibitor- a targetted therapy that widely used for her2neu+ breast cancer. a subtype of gastric cancer expresses her2 mutation- and herceptin (trastuzumab) has been used to treat this subtype of gastric cancer resulting in a good response.
chemotherapy hormone receptor positive node breast cancer?

it's possible you may have a deeper collection within the breast. you may need an ultrasound or an alternative antibiotic. not to cause alarm but there's even a form of breast cancer which causes inflammation and can appear to be mastitis. you're very young so that's unlikely - i'm just thinking out loud. follow up with your provider who prescribed your abx. good luck.
i had surgical breast biopsy then atypical hyperplasia removal. was this necessary? what would have happened if i hadn't intervened?
atypical breast hyperplasia is a pre-cancerous lesion. if a core biopsy (needle) shows ah an excisional biopsy is usually performed and in a small number of cases an early form of breast cancer can be discovered. i would certainly recommend vigilant screening with annual mammography and monthly self breast exams. good luck.
if you have a family history of breast cancer when should you start getting tested for it?
the past month i operated on a 24 year old with breast cancer. the first thing to start doing is a self breast exam!
if you have a family history of breast cancer when should you start getting tested for it?
family history depends a lot on what type of history that is specifically. who were the relatives how early was their cancer diagnosed etc. a great idea is to speak with a genetic counselor if you're worried or speak with your gynecologist and see if you need a referral to a geneticist. a family tree with all the information will help them guide you. good luck!

what you mean. if you need treatment get yourself a multidisciplinary group of docs. if you need information check the american cancer society or the national cancer institute websites.
if you had undiagnosed breast cancer and then got pregnant would the pregnancy hormones shrink the tumor?
the very high hormone levels of pregnancy are a big risk factor for increased growth and often women with a breast cancer diagnosis have to deliver their babies early so that they can have their evaluation for the cancer completed or surgery done and begin any additional treatments necessary.
if you had undiagnosed breast cancer and then got pregnant would the pregnancy hormones shrink the tumor?
it would most likely get bigger. hope this helps.
is it true if you had a maternal aunt with breast cancer you are more likely to get it?
yes. family history of breast cancer in second degree relatives increases the risk of breast cancer but only modestly. family history in a first degree relative is a much stronger risk factor. in addition if the family member is diagnosed younger age the risk is higher than if he/she was diagnosed at older age.
is it true if you had a maternal aunt with breast cancer you are more likely to get it?
which aunt does not matter; any close relative having had breast cancer suggests a genetic predisposition. especially if it came on early consider being checked for brca1/brca2.

it is unusual to be faced with this question because invasive cancer simply means the cancer is real and not in-situ (stage-0) any more. inflammatory cancer is one type of invasive cancer. other types are called invasive ductal carcinoma or invasive lobular carcinoma of the breast.
if you get an abnormal result for mammography and you have had uterine cáncer and just checked your cancer antigen its 6. 3. cáncer a for sure thing?
results are probably not related to the uterine cancer. an abnormal mammo doesn't mean you have breast cancer either. 70-80% of the time a mammographic abnormality turns out to be benign.
is it true that there is a pillow that helps relive the pain after breast cancer surgery?
the location and severity of post op pain varies depending on the type of surgery (for example lumpectomy vs mastectomy lymph node removal or not reconstruction or not). the most comfortable sleeping position for each patient will vary depending on the type of surgery so there is probably not a one-size-fits-all pillow/cushion.
i have bite sized lumps on my breasts. could this be breast cancer?
you need a real evaluation and physical exam by a doctor. no website can do that.
i was wondering is breast cancer a gene or chromosomal disorder?
i think you are really asking if breast cancer is hereditary meaning is it past from a parent it is possible to inherit a predisposition to breast cancer. there are a few genes known to cause this like brca 1 ; 2 and tests can be done for them. on the other hand all breast cancers have genetic abnormalities. these changes however were not inherited but happened in the patient.
i'm anemic have heavy periods mom had breast cancer. gyno gave me norethindrone & said it didn't have estrogen so wouldnt cause cancer. is that true?
there's very little data that norethindrone causes breast cancer when used to slow down heavy periods. i would have some concern if you had a history of breast cancer but since you don't i'm not worried.
i'm anemic have heavy periods mom had breast cancer. gyno gave me norethindrone & said it didn't have estrogen so wouldnt cause cancer. is that true?
first progesterones which norethindrone is one is associated with increase risk in breast cancer (i would not state causing it). risk is more so in women using during postmenopause and for prolonged periods. actually estrogen use by itself remains controversial as a risk factor for breast cancer. if your anemia is due to very heavy periods a limited course of hormonal manipulation can help.

depending upon your age and menstrual status your oncologist will help choose a medication to block the receptors for estrogen and progesterone or one that will block the production of those hormones. these drugs minimize the ability of these hormones to stimulate the growth of breast and breast cancer cells. some of them are associated with a risk of endometrial cancer but it is minimal.
can the hormone drugs taken after breast cancer surgery cause other cancers?
tarnished with the association is tamoxifen and endometrial cancer. the risk is only in women that still have their uterus; the frequency about 1/1000. it is otherwise a very good and successful drug. i still use it. the benefit is high and the risk is quite low.

that is a very unusual place for breast cancer to spread to. in general if breast cancer spreads the most common organs it spreads to are the lungs liver bones and brain. this can occur at any time around the diagnosis of the breast cancer but is mostly likely within the first 2 years.
how long does it take for breast cancer to mestesise to the retina?
while breast cancer can metastasize it is rare for it to go to the retina. the time until a breast cancer spreads depends upon the aggressiveness of the cancer not the site to which it travels.
how long does it take for breast cancer to mestesise to the retina?
while the most common places for breast cancer to spread to are the lung bones brain and adrenal glands the most likely source or a metastatic tumor to the retina is from breast. how long it takes for it to spread and go there from the time it first develops is hard to determine since it depends in many variables related to the primary tumor.
how would recurrent psoriasis affect breast cancer reconstruction?
where is the psoriasis? is it located where breast surgery would be performed? active skin lesions located at the site of surgery would increase infection & poor healing risks. if the psoriasis is located somewhere else then likely no effect on the surgery. ask a plastic surgeon & have them examine you.
hi please when is the best day todo mammogram and echo of the breast after my monthly circle. thank you?
during the first week of your menstrual cycle is the ideal time to have your mammogram. the breast tissue is less dense during the first seven days of your cycle and may make the mammogram more sensitive and better able to detect breast cancers and possibly cause less patient discomfort. the us (echo) should be ordered by your dr. as needed based on your mammogram results and your clinical exam.
how suseptable can a woman be to breast cancer if she already suffers from suger diabeates and high blood pressure?
if no genetic transmission involved like braca i & ii. susceptible like any other woman diabetes and hypertension has no correlation see your doctor regularly. and do not worry.
how suseptable can a woman be to breast cancer if she already suffers from suger diabeates and high blood pressure?
medical conditions such as you describe of diabetes or high blood pressure are not related to increased risks of breast cancer. women with medical conditions would have the same risks as other women for breast cancer. genetics young age at first menstrual cycle older age at first childbirth prolonged exposure to hormone medications obesity can be risk factors for breast cancer.
how suseptable can a woman be to breast cancer if she already suffers from suger diabeates and high blood pressure?
these should not increase her risk of developing breast cancer. if she develops obesity however this will increase her risk.
hormone sensitive breast cancer 7 yrs ago; 3 small spots w breast cancer cells in lungs just showed; now using femara; should i stop using astaxanthin?
i will recommend stopping astaxanthin which is a carotenoid but also a potent antioxidant. how femara (letrozole) or letrozole interacts with this compound and because of the super radical and antioxidant effects it can potentially make femara (letrozole) less effective is possible. there is no proven benefit of this in breast cancer. hopefully this helps.
hormone sensitive breast cancer 7 yrs ago; 3 small spots w breast cancer cells in lungs just showed; now using femara; should i stop using astaxanthin?
but it might depending on what the oncologist decides to do next. the supplement you are taking does not interact with femara (letrozole) but they might want you to stop it when they change treatment. good luck to you!
had breast cancer (6 yrs ago) and us shows i have hypodense solid nodules on my thyroid. should i be concerned and what would you recommend doing now?
you were obviously diagnosed with breast cancer at a very young age (23) which is always concerning and puts you at risk for other cancers just by being a cancer survivor yourself. you shouldn't ignore any new findings like this. a biopsy might be necessary to rule out a second cancer especially if you received radiation to the chest/neck area. please see your doctor.
had breast cancer (6 yrs ago) and us shows i have hypodense solid nodules on my thyroid. should i be concerned and what would you recommend doing now?
you had breast cancer at age 23? that is very unusual. hypodense nodules of the thyroid are usually not cancerous so do whatever the doctor managing you is recommending as follow-up.
had breast cancer (6 yrs ago) and us shows i have hypodense solid nodules on my thyroid. should i be concerned and what would you recommend doing now?
these nodules are most likely unrelated to your breast cancer. they do need to be followed. you should see an endocrinologist and see if they feel these nodules should be biopsied with a fine needle.
hi docs! i'm diagnosed w dcis. will i b more susceptible to cancers in other areas? lumpectomy done n now due for crt.
~90% of breast cancer are environmental with little association w/other cancers. however thehereditary forms of breast cancer can be associated w/other cancers most notably ovarian cancer. if you have multiple relatives with breast and/or ovarian cancer it would be advisable to meet w/a genetic counselor. a simple blood test (brca) can help sort this out. good luck!
how can breast cancer differ with a lump compared to microcalcifications?
a breast lump that you can feel is likely a more advanced breast cancer compared to micocalcifications. micricalcificatons only has a 10-15% chance of having cancer & likely to represent a very small and very early cancer if malognant (or non-invasive in situ).

is tamoxifen needed for dcis that was treated with lumpectomy&radiation? been on it for 2yrs&have bad side effects. sonogram showed endometr thickenin
tamoxifen drops your risk of developing a new breast cancer in either breast by 1/2. but the absolute benefit is small. you are only 22 so your lifetime risk of having a new breast cancer is higher than if you were 50. ask your doctor for the numbers (your risk of developing a new breast cancer with or without tamoxifen) and ask about raloxifene a similar drug. then make your decision.
i am a young mum who has just been diagnosed with breast cancer i wanted to know what my treatment options are and possible fertility issues?
hi beatrice i am so sorry to hear ab your diagnosis. at stage 2 you have an excellent chance of being cured. because the lymph nodes are involved you should strongly consider chemo to improve your chances. you need to see a fertility specialist prior to starting to talk about embryo/egg preservation. chemo may decrease your ability to have another baby. discuss w oncologist. i am rooting for you!
i am a young mum who has just been diagnosed with breast cancer i wanted to know what my treatment options are and possible fertility issues?
you have multiple options but you need to be more specific with your information. need to know type of breast cancer stage response to hormones genotype etc before your answer can be addressed accurately.
is it safe to wear makeup especially liquid foundation that contain parabens? do parabens in makeup cause breast cancer?
there is no relationship of make up with causing breast cancer. just eat healthy and stay trim by eating low fat foods and exercise daily. this is the recipe to keep cancer at bay.
i have brownish nipple discharge (and i'm a guy)?
see a doctor in person even if it seems awkward do it. this is likely nothing to worry about but nipple discharge in men is unusual enough it out to be checked. although it's rare men also get breast cancer so please get it examined.

xeloda is the oral form of 5fu. depending on the nature of the tumor and whether metastatic cancer is being treated combinations of chemotherapy are being used such as cmf or taxol with herceptin (trastuzumab). its up to the treating physician as to whether a single agent is to utilized.
is coughing out blood or having chest pains a sign of breast cancer?
it is a sign of nothing good. get it checked out by a physician. without also having a size able lump in your breast or a past history of breast cancer i think it is rather unlikely that these are signs of breast cancer however.
is coughing out blood or having chest pains a sign of breast cancer?
this probably is not a sign of breast cancer but still could be a sign of a serious medical condition. you need to be examined by a doctor immediately. go seek care in an emergency department if this is happening to you.

triclosan is an ingredient used in products like antibacterial soaps and toothpaste. its been around for 40 years and may have side effects related to changing hormone patterns. for the most part breast cancer is inherited in about 5% of patients and is probably caused or associated with viral entry into the breast duct wnt-1 gene in about 80% of patients via the mmtv virus.
in light of new findings about triclosan if it truly could cause breast cancer wouldn't there be many more cases of breast cancer in the population?
data still remains to be gathered about its causation of breast cancer disruption of the endocrine system which is very involved in the growth of breast cancer could be increased in frequency with continued use of triclosan.
inflammatory breast cancer symptoms come & go or progressively worsen over days/weeks? had breast pain during & after cycle 4 1 week but no pain now.
dr. h's answer is accurate. breast pain at various times in the cycle can often be helped by diet changes especially by avoiding caffeine. acupuncture ; oriental medicine can be very helpful as complementary approaches for treating symptoms that come ; go as these are usually functional problems that have not progressed to organ pathologies such as the cancer you worry about.

is it possible to get breast cancer after a mastectomy?
during a mastectomy the surgeon attempts to remove as much breast tissue as possible but no surgeon can remove every last bit of breast tissue. your residual skin/surrounding tissue still has to remain viable. so even with a double mastectomy (removal of both breasts) there is still a very small chance of developing breast cancer at a later time.
is it possible to get breast cancer after a mastectomy?
it is possible to get breast cancer after a mastectomy but the risk should be low. it also depends on the type of cancer you are treated for the type of treatment you received and if the margins are clear. it is best to speak with your oncology team about your risks for a breast cancer after mastectomy.

if your grandmother had breast cancer at the age of 61 and your mom who is now 46 has an abnormal mammogram but a normal ultrasound the recommendation would be to recheck the ultrasound in 6 months. if you can feel a lump are still concerned it would be reasonable to do an ultrasound guided biopsy. it is very common to get lymph nodes that are abnormal on mammo but normal on ultrasound.
it was i that has the lymph node my mother died at 46 from breast cancer and my grandmother died at 61 from breast cancer.
if your mother had breast cancer at 46 and grandmother died at 61 you have a very strong family hx of breast cancer suggesting the possibility of a gene mutation. you should undergo a biopsy under ultrasound. depending on your insurance you may also be a candidate for brca genetic testing. genetic testing will help determine what type of treatment and screening you should undergo.
is flaxseed thought to prevent breast cancer?
only moderate amounts of ground flaxseeds up to two to three tablespoons per day at most should be eaten. flaxseed contains some phytoestrogens which likely don't encourage cancer or affect hormone positive breast cancers but as with many vitamins/minerals it's nearly always best to get majority of nutrition from diet.
if breast cancer isn't rare in women under 40 why are there no screening methods offered? shouldn't regular ultrasound or mri be encouraged?
women at higher risk can begin screening before age 40. this could entail mammography sonography or mri depending on the circumstances. although younger women and men can get breast cancer the likelihood is not high enough to warrant a general screening program. the costs($$ unnecessary biopsies etc. ) would not be outweighed by the benefits.
i have ocd and can not stop feeling this one area of my breast. i'll poked so hard it's now bruised. does this make it likely i'll get breast cancer?
it is not so easy to create cancer. trauma certainly can not change our body cells that much so it is highly unlikely that you have to worry about cancer unless there is a growth or lump already present there. sometime in the future you should get a mammogram(when you are near 40 years old) of this breast just to be sure. but they would not like to do x-rays in younger women. (under 30 year old)
i have ocd and can not stop feeling this one area of my breast. i'll poked so hard it's now bruised. does this make it likely i'll get breast cancer?
some checking compulsions can inadvertently cause harm. in your case this has taken the form of a bruise. another feature of ocd is seeking reassurance and your question appears to be doing just that. this is another form of compulsion and you will not be helped by getting reassurance.

i went to my doctor for breast pain he said he felt something there i have to get a mammogram it's in both breast change in meds have anything to do?
the pain is bilateral but your doctor felt something on one side? bilateral pain is generally not a sign of breast cancer. if your doctor felt something however it needs to be evaluated. at your age ultrasound is typically the first imaging study but mammogram not inappropriate either.
in early stage her-2 breast cancer which is the best option:- is it taking drugs or a total removal of the breast?
mastectomy or lump-x + radiation rx are local treatments of breast cancer with equal survival rates. one or the other is necessary for all breast ca pt's. chemotherapy ("drugs") are systemic (whole body) rx's for certain breast cancers. her2neu (+) cancers are particularly sensitive to herceptin (trastuzumab). please meet with your oncologist to understand the different options you have. good luck.
in early stage her-2 breast cancer which is the best option:- is it taking drugs or a total removal of the breast?
her2 (+) breast cancers typically need chemotherapy. chemotherapy followed by surgery +/- radiation is very good option. long term outcome no different w mastectomy vs lumpectomy.
in early stage her-2 breast cancer which is the best option:- is it taking drugs or a total removal of the breast?
early stage breast cancer can often safely be treated with a lumpectomy + rad therapy (breast conservation). a mastectomy may be preferred for larger or multiple tumors cosmetic outcome or genetic risk. the her-2 pos does not directly impact the (local) surgical decision at this time but certainly determines the systemic therapy specifically the need for herceptin perjeta (pertuzumab) and chemotherapy
i usually feel a sharp pain inside my right breast. the appearance looks normal no lump or discharge. but painful when i touched it. what's this pls?

stage iv describes invasive breast cancer that has spread beyond the breast and nearby lymph nodes to other organs of the body such as the lungs distant lymph nodes skin bones liver or brain. talk to your oncologist to determine the extent/ or remission of the cancer. stage 4 usually means that cancer was not just in the breast area.
is cinnamon ceylon type in natural from safe for breast cancer survivors? i've read that it contains estrogen.
supposedly cinnamon does have some estrogenic properties but there isn't any strong data out there that suggests those with estrogen receptor (+) breast cancer are at any significant risk with cinnamon consumption. i would caution you that in general that more is rarely ever better and that if you are "gung ho" about cinnamon supplementation that you be reasonable about your intake.
i've taken birth control for two years. does my risk of side serious effects (blood clots breast cancer) increase the longer i take it?
although the absolute risks of serious side effects and complications such as blood clots strokes and heart attacks are statistically low these risks do accumulate over time. exercise healthy diet avoidance of smoking can all help to reduce the risks. the only way to eliminate the risks are to stop the hormone replacement and use a different form of contraception

i am currently taking microgestin 21 1. 5-30 as a birth control pill. will the 30 mcg content of estrogen increase a risk of breast cancer?
of breast cancer include age family history history of tobacco abuse and unopposed estrogen therapy the last of which is only a negligible increase in risk. so an increase in risk is unlikely
i had a breast lump almost a year ago. got it checked the ultrasound didn't show anything. could it be breast cancer? i turned 17 this year
at your age a breast cancer is unlikely but still possible. if the lump is still present you should see your doctor for re-evaluation.

you should be preforming regular checks yourself and with your doctor. if you still feel something but the ultrasound doesn't show anything your doctor will suggest further testing. if the ultrasound shows a cyst that can be watched. if the ultrasound shows a solid entity a biopsy might me needed. at 17 you chances of cancer are low.
is there a way to regulate your period without the pill? does the pill increase ur chances of breast cancer or any other cancer (it runs in my family)
most gyn doctor use bcp to regulate your period so far there is no concrete evidence of breast cancer and bcp some study suggest that hormone replacement might increase the chance in some women strong family history of breast cancer would indicate to have a genetic testing to make sure you do not have the gene that caused breast cancer either way need to see a doctor breast specialist . gyn onco
i've had breast pain for 2 months and tissue seems denser than other breast. if it were inflammatory breast cancer would symptoms be worse by now?
ibc is a very aggressive form of cancer causing redness and swelling thus the name inflammatory. what you describe does not sound like inflammatory breast cancer (especially if to has not turned into a dreadful mess after those 2 months) but please see your doc for a good evaluation. and btw good to see you have never engaged in tobacco use. good for you.
i've had breast pain for 2 months and tissue seems denser than other breast. if it were inflammatory breast cancer would symptoms be worse by now?
inflammatory breast cancer (ibc) usually is diffuse swelling enlargement heaviness redness and skin swelling. pain is rare in breast cancer unless it is so advanced that it has eroded out through the skin or eating into the underlying muscles. by that time there is an obvious large hard mass. lobular breast cancer can show up like this however and i strongly urge you to see a dr soon!

your oncologist so many treatment options are now available to control of your disease. good luck
i have a family history of breast cancer. how concerned should i be?
the main importance of family history is who how are they related how close are they and does your family have an inherited dna change called brca-1 or brca-2. remote relatives relatives on both sides of the family and lack of brca presence can make your risk perhaps no higher than any other woman's. i recommend you see a genetic counselor for a detailed look at your risk. good luck!

her 2 over expressed breast cancer is considered to be more aggressive and have a higher risk of recurring. that being said there are many more targeted agents which make this type of breast cancer more treatable and curable.
is her2 positive or her2 negative better when dealing with breast cancer?
her-2-neu + or - isn't necessarily "better" or "worse" -- more important is the specifics of a woman's breast cancer. is it "luminal" or "basal"? spread to lymph nodes other organs blood or bone marrow? what is general health age and what treatments have been offered. her2 + means herceptin (trastuzumab) a chemotherapy drug has the potential to help kill cancer cells but may not change survival.

it is one of the many options for evaluating breasts. mammogram and ultrasound are the most common. mri is useful in pts with implants so both breast and implants can b evaluated.
can you please tell me why it'sthat breast cancer is always being recognized but not the other types of cancers?
it is a common cancer it has an effective screening can be treated successfully when detected early and affects patients in a very visible way so it's not surprising it generates so much buzz. there are other social and political reasons as well. in a way it may feel unfair to those suffering of other cancers so we need to be advocates for all patients with cancer regardless of the type.

fat necrosis does not become breast cancer. sometimes fat necrosis can look concerning enough on a mammogram to be biopsied. the calcifications and scarring from the necrosis can at times resemble breast cancer. however once proven fat necrosis is a benign diagnosis.
can you please tell me about moderate stage breast cancer?
you can have breast cancer stages 0 through 4 and perhaps call the first ones "early stage" but i've never heard of a "moderate" stage. maybe you mean moderately differentiated tumor grade which has to do with the appearance of the cells in the eyes of a pathologist. lots of folks confuse grade with stage. both are important but quite different things.

the statistical probability of getting breast cancer at 15 is lower than the odds of winning the lottery. breast cancer rates increase the older you are and are rarely seen before the 30's. however if one has a palpable lump and/or a strong family history of breast or ovarian cancer it is best to discuss with one's primary care doctor or gynecologist.
could a 15 year old get breast couldcer?
it is possible there is a type of breast cancer called juvenile (or secretory) breast cancer that can occur in teenagers. however this is extremely rare and a new breast mass in a 15 year old is likely a fibroadenoma cyst or other benign lesion. even some benign masses may need to be removed so any new or enlarging breast mass should be evaluated by a physician.

could you tell me what are different leads to of breast cancer besides heredity?
cause and effect are hard to prove. women with several first degree relatives having cancer are at higher risk. new studies have identified certain genes that are high risk as well. women who have "uncycled estrogen" like those with no children or long term bcp use have more risk. women with certain types of breast changes develop higher risk too. consider a look at 'nci risk assessment tool'.
could you tell me what are different leads to of breast cancer besides heredity?
hereditary breast cancer accounts for less than 10% of all cases. most cases are sporadic. some of the risk factors asscociated with development of breast cancer are early age at first menstruation late menapause nulliparity (never pregnant) obesity female sex (100 times more common in women than in men) older age certain benign breast condition chest irradiation.

can all breast cancer patients carry the brca genes?
many patients with breast cancer have no genetic predisposition or risk for breast cancer. however there are several genetic markers which increase the risk of developing breast cancer over a person's lifetime.
can all breast cancer patients carry the brca genes?
we all have the genes named brca but we don't all have mutations in those genes. it's the brca mutations that increase the risk for breast cancer. it turns out that 85% of breast cancers have nothing to do with the brca gene. so most patients with breast cancer do not have a brca1 or brca2 mutation. i hope that answers your question!
can all breast cancer patients carry the brca genes?
we all have the brca genes in our dna. god (or evolution your choice) put it there with the purpose of repairing damaged dna destroying dna that can't be repaired and other things. when it's mutated (changed) in certain places it does not work and leads to the development of cancer. only a small number of breast cancer patients inherit such deleterious or "bad" mutations.
can putting your cell phone in your bra cause breast cancer?
evidence to support or refute this causation. it is probably not a good idea to keep it there all the time.

as a matter of fact it actually slightly reduces your chances for a future breast cancer.
can you let me know is invasive ductal carcinoma really "no big deal"?
that is the most common category of breast cancer so i'm not sure why anybody would say such an absurd thing. it is curable if found early but it kills thousands of women every year. ask the husband who lost a wife or the child who lost a mother if they think it's no big deal.
could a 12 year old get breast couldcer?
breast cancer is very rare in women under 30 and increases in incidence the older you get. the statistical probabibility of having breast cancer at 12 is less than the probability of winning a million dollars in the lottery. a breast lump in a 12-yr old girl is most likely a benign fibroadenoma which can be confirmed by ultrasound +/- biopsy.

can breast cancer cause high fai and low shbg?
"free androgen index" and "sex-hormone binding globulin"? that is news to me. there's a few old correlations with obesity but nothing i could find more recently. i'd reiterate my colleague's request to keep the abbreviations / acronyms to a minimum -- there's way too both in real life and in medicine. i'm wondering why you ask but i hope this was helpful.
can breast cancer cause high fai and low shbg?
your abreviations are not helpful. so do not use them. breast cancer does not cause any of what you are concerned about. why do you even ask?
can you please tell me if it's neccesary to have a mammogram at 30?
mayce: the recommendation for mammography is to begin at 40 and have one every year thereafter. there are special circumstances where mammography can/should be done earlier such as a very strong family history of premenopausal breast cancer there is a problem (lump discharge dimpling etc). if younger than 30 with a problem a sonogram is usually done before a mammogram.

some studies suggest that use of birth control pills appears to slightly increase the risk of breast cancer especially among younger women. however the risk level goes back to normal 10 years or more after discontinuing oral contraceptive use. women who use oral contraceptives have reduced risks of ovarian and endometrial cancer.
can there be a scientific link between breast implants and cancer?
breast implants do not cause breast cancer. breast implants require special mammographic techniques to image as much of the breast tissue as possible. women with implants do not have their breast tissue imaged as thoroughly/completely as women without breast implants. but women with implants do not have a higher risk of breast cancer nor a later diagnosis of breast cancer. bse remains important.
can there be a scientific link between breast implants and cancer?
5 separate scientific studies that show no link between breast cancer and breast implants. there is a very rare tumor called alcl which may be associated with textured implants. research is ongoing into this topic.
can there be a scientific link between breast implants and cancer?
there has never been shown to be a causal relationship between implants and breast cancer. in fact statistics show a lower incidence but this may be due to other factors. breast implants may delay or interfere with the diagnosis of breast cancer but survival rates are not effected. a higher risk of an atypical lymphoma has been documented but is extremely rare. sbe & special mammos are the rule!
can there be a scientific link between breast implants and cancer?
breast implants do not affect the rate of breast cancer according to the most recent plastic surgery research. there is a slightly increased risk of alcl in women with silicone implants.

do breast implants increase the risk of cancer? my friend just got breast implants. does having implants effect the chance that she could get breast cancer at some point in the future? do implants make it easier or harder to detect any lumps?
breast implant do not increase or decrease the risk of having breast cancer. breast examination should be just like any other woman. when you get a mammography you need to tell your technician that you have implants so they can have special views. very little breast tissue may be masked with implants. feeling lumps can actually be easier because the breast is pushed forward by the implant.
do breast implants increase the risk of cancer? my friend just got breast implants. does having implants effect the chance that she could get breast cancer at some point in the future? do implants make it easier or harder to detect any lumps?
no breast implants do not affect the chance of developing breast cancer in the future. the risk of developing cancer in your friend with implants is neither increased or decreased. however implants do make it more difficult to detect cancer on mammography. a study published in the journal of the american medical association showed that mammography detected only 45 out of 100 breast cancers in women with breast implants. this was in comparison to 67 out of 100 cancers detected in women without breast implants.
do breast implants increase the risk of cancer? my friend just got breast implants. does having implants effect the chance that she could get breast cancer at some point in the future? do implants make it easier or harder to detect any lumps?
there is no evidence that breast implants increas the risk or impede the detection of breast cancer.
do breast implants increase the risk of cancer? my friend just got breast implants. does having implants effect the chance that she could get breast cancer at some point in the future? do implants make it easier or harder to detect any lumps?
there is no direct link but there are concerns with the potential for implants to interfere with the detection of cancer. particularly using mammograms. special views (eklund) must be obtained. alhtough there may be a delay in diagnosis there has not been shown to be any effect on survival. with mri surveillance is improved and may supplant mammography. as stated alcl may be increased but rare.
do breast implants increase the risk of cancer? my friend just got breast implants. does having implants effect the chance that she could get breast cancer at some point in the future? do implants make it easier or harder to detect any lumps?
breast implants do not affect the rate of breast cancer according to the most recent plastic surgery research. there is a slightly increased risk of alcl in women with silicone implants. women with implants should have screening mammograms with eklund views to check for cancer in addition to screening mris as directed for silicone implants.
does breast feeding reduce the risk of breast cancer?
yep and the number of pregnancy does as well.
does breast feeding reduce the risk of breast cancer?
it can.
does breast feeding reduce the risk of breast cancer?
the short answer is yes for both mom and baby girls. how much does it reduce the risk is more debatable. it also reduces the risk of ovarian and possibly endometrial cancers as well. in f act pregnancy itself may help reduce the risks of these also. here are a couple of studies from reputable journals that demonstrated reduction in breast cancer risk for women that breast fed: if women who do not breastfeed or who breastfed for less than 3 months were to do so for 4 to 12 months breast cancer among parous premenopausal women could be reduce by 11%; if all women with children lactated for 24 months or longer the incidence might be reduced by nearly 25%. source: newcomb p. etal. "lactation and reduced risk of premenopausal breast cancer. " n engl j med 1994; 330(2):81-87. women who were breastfed as infants even if only for a short time showed an approximate 25% lower risk of developing premenopausal or postmenopausal breast cancer compared to women who were bottle-fed as an infant. source: freudenheim j. "exposure to breast milk in infancy and the risk of breast cancer. " epidemiology 1994 5:324-331.
does an ultrasound of the breast mean i don't have to take a mammogram?
a breast ultrasound is usually done to evaluate a specific finding identified on physical exam or on a screening mammogram. it does not count as an overall screening test for breast cancer. an annual mammogram still needs to be performed.
does an ultrasound of the breast mean i don't have to take a mammogram?
it really depends on your age your risk factors and why you got the ultrasound in the first place. ultrasounds are used to evaluate a breast mass that you can feel. they will not pick up microscopic breast cancer. mammograms will pick up microscopic breast cancers (before you can feel it).
does the estrogen that my physician prescribes increase my chance for breast cancer?
studies have shown that prolonged use of estrogen replacement especially when in combination with progesterone may increase the risk of breast cancer by as much as 25%. this risk seems to diminish considerably 5-10 years after discontinuing the drug(s).
does the estrogen that my physician prescribes increase my chance for breast cancer?
it depends on the type of estrogen you are being prescribed and the reason. it also depends on your personal risk factors for breast cancer (family history etc) birth control pills do not increase one's risk. hormone replacement for menopause can increase the risk if taken longer than 5 years.
does natural progesterone prevent breast cancer?
there is no evidence progesterone of any type prevents breast cancer "natural" progesterone or not. if a woman has menses that only occur a few times a year six or four or fewer however progesterone or progesterone-like compounds can very definitely prevent endometrial hyperplasia (which can lead to uterine cancer) and should be used regularly to oppose continuous estrogen stimulation.
does natural progesterone prevent breast cancer?
progesterone has been implicated as the "bad guy" in combined hormone replacement therapy when it comes to breast cancer. women taking estrogen + progesterone natural or not were at higher risk of developing breast cancer. also their breast cancers tended to be more aggressive. progesterone also seems to increase the aggressiveness of other cancers. natural progesterone is not any safer.
does natural progesterone prevent breast cancer?
the evidence is unclear on this topic.

yes.
does a family history of breast cancer put someone at a higher risk?
it increases the relative risk of one developing breast cancer.
does breast cancer run in families?
hereditary breast cancer occurs approximately in about 15% of cases. majority of breast cancer occurs sporadically.
does breast cancer run in families?
having a family history does increase your risk. although the vast majority of women with breast cancer do not have a family history.
does breast cancer run in families?
it is estimated that10-15% of all breast cancer cases in the us are hereditary. a simple blood test exists to see if someone has a genetic mutation responsible for many of these hereditary breast cancers. if someone has this mutation they have as high as a 65% chance of getting breast ca in their lifetime. their children have a 50:50 chance of inheriting this mutation.
does hormone replacement therapy for menopausal symptoms cause breast cancer?
hormone replacement therapy (hrt) has been shown to increase one's risk for breast cancer if taken for longer than 5 years. the current recommendation is to take low doses for a limited amount of time and then stop. there are some other non hormonal medications that can be used to help manage menopausal symptoms.
does hormone replacement therapy for menopausal symptoms cause breast cancer?
there are three human esrogens: estradiol (from the ovary) estriol (from the placenta in pregnancy) and estrone (from peripheral fat conversion). estrone is probably the culprit since women with excess peripheral body fat have increase rates of estrogen related cancers (breast uterus ovary colon). many oral estrogen hormones on the market are converted to estrone in the liver.
does hormone replacement therapy for menopausal symptoms cause breast cancer?
virtually all of the studies showing that hrt increases breast cancer have been done on premarin (conjugated estrogens). premarin (conjugated estrogens) is converted to estrone in the liver when taken orally. overweight women convert adrenal hormones into estrone in peripheral body fat & have increased rates of estrogen dependent cancers (breast colon uterine). i suspect the culprit is estrone not estradiol/estriol the other human estrogens.
does hormone replacement therapy for menopausal symptoms cause breast cancer?
the cause of breast cancer is so complex and poorly understood that it's better to talk about "associations" rather than "causes". studies have shown that women who have used hormone replacement have a slightly higher incidence of breast cancer as compared to women that have not. in general if you can avoid it it's better to especially if you have other risk factors for breast cancer.
does reliv slow the growth of breast cancer?
reliv is a nutritional product that is not regulated by the fda. no studies have been published showing that reliv slows the growth of breast cancer. one study has been published showing reliv helps with radiation-related fatigue in cancer patients.
does reliv slow the growth of breast cancer?
this is a "health supplement" and not a prescribed medication. this substances that claim to cure cancer have not gone through the rigorous testing (clinical trials) that our standard medications have gone through via the fda. see a breast cancer team for optimal treatments and care. you may put your live in danger (and shorten it) by not seeking out care that is proven and approved by the fda.
does radiation therapy affect having breast reconstruction?
the main goal of breast cancer treatment is to remove the cancer cells. radiation is often used to decrease the risk of local recurrence. radiation is indiscriminate in that it kills cancer and normal cells too. the result is tougher tighter skin that has a reduced blood supply. the incidence of complications associated with breast reconstruction is higher after radiation esp. with implants.
does radiation therapy affect having breast reconstruction?
women who need radiation for their breast cancer can still safely have reconstructions and end up with a good cosmetic result. radiation can significantly improve the cure rate and should not be avoided due to concerns about reconstruction. there are many ways to combine rt and reconstruction and you should speak with an experienced team.
does radiation therapy affect having breast reconstruction?
you should not avoid having radiation if it is recommended for your breast cancer treatment. it may make breast reconstruction a bit more challenging but usually does not prevent reconstruction. you should definitely consult a board certified plastic surgeon with experience in breast reconstruction to get more specific information concerning your treatment.
does smoking cause breast cancer?
no direct correlation with breast cancer and smoking. there is direct correlation with several other cancers and smoking. lung cancer head and neck cancer bladder cancer is to name just a few.
does smoking cause breast cancer?
but smoking causes mamy other problems that are more deadly then breast cancer. did you know that far more women die from cardiovascular disease and from lung cancer than die from breast cancer? smoking also makes your skin age badly. if you are 22 and smoking stop. smoking is one of the stupidest things that a human being can do.
does smoking cause breast cancer?
there may be a slight increase in breast cancer risk but even if there wasn't smoking can lead to development of multiple other kinds of cancer plus cardiovascular and lung disease. no redeeming value to smoking. it is good to view lifestyle choices in the light of how they affect health in general not just specific illnesses. best regards and happy holidays.
does stress increase my likelihood of developing breast cancer?
stress is a negative immunomodulator meaning it decreases the effectiveness of the immune system which slows healing and immune response among other things. there are some who believe it can contribute to worse outcomes in any disease and maybe increase the risk of disease. you will be healthier overall if you learn stress reduction techniques [yoga meditation etc].
does stress increase my likelihood of developing breast cancer?
the evidence on this is unclear.
does stress increase my likelihood of developing breast cancer?
it has not been scientifically proven that stress causes cancer. some viruses cause cancers so it is possible that stress alters the way the body fights off or deals with viruses and could make one more susceptible to developing cancers. stress can alter the function of the immune system perhaps making it harder for the immune system to detect and destroy mutant cells before they reproduce.
does tamoxifen for breast cancer put me at risk for uterine cancer?
studies have shown that women taking tamoxifen have twice the risk of developing uterine cancer as compared to the general population. however the benefits of tamoxifen far outweigh this risk when treating many breast cancers. when taking tamoxifen it is critical to see your gynecologist yearly and be mindful of any pelvic pain or irregular menstrual bleeding.
do any foods naturally reduce or increase your chances of getting a breast disease?
there are no foods that definitely cause or prevent breast cancer. generally speaking it is goid to eat plenty if vegetables and fruit to provide vitamins and antioxidants. starches and fatty foods and fast foods are considered unhealthy as they are associated with overweight or obesity which is associated with an elevated estrogen level which may be a factor which can increase your risk.
do you need to have a lump in the breast to have breast cancer?
some early breast cancers do not present with a lump or mass. they present with findings on a mammogram or ultrasound. calcifications commonly present with out a palpable mass.
do you need to have a lump in the breast to have breast cancer?
very often there is not a lump and the cancer is just picked up on imaging.
do you need to have a lump in the breast to have breast cancer?
very often breast cancer is diagnosed on a screening mammogram done in a patient with no signs or symptoms of cancer.
do you need to have a lump in the breast to have breast cancer?
actually the main goal of mammograms is to find cancer before you could feel them. we often identify breast cancer that is as small as a few grains of sand. mammograms save lives!

i am not aware of clear link between breast cancer and colon cancer.
does breast cancer reconstruction surgery look natural? i have to undergo a double mastectomy for breast cancer and am deciding whether to have breast cancer reconstruction surgery. would the surgery leave my breasts feeling hard and unnatural? i might ch
no a breast reconstruction should not feel hard or unnatural. the main surgery i perform is the diep flap which uses the skin and fat of the abdomen to create natural feeling and appearinbrg breasts. with the release of silicone implants in the us market over the last few years we now can perform implant based reconstruction are natural in appearance and soft to the touch. please see plastic surg.
does breast cancer reconstruction surgery look natural? i have to undergo a double mastectomy for breast cancer and am deciding whether to have breast cancer reconstruction surgery. would the surgery leave my breasts feeling hard and unnatural? i might ch
every patient may have a different experience with implants. the majority of implants are not hard at all. there is another type of breast reconstruction called tram flap reconstruction that does not require the use of implants. today women can also participate in picking out the color of the nipple to be tattooed onto the reconstructed breast. some surgeons actually make a nipple using the patients' skin. the majority of reconstructed breasts that i have seen in my practice are beautiful. we have many talented plastic surgeons.
does breast cancer reconstruction surgery look natural? i have to undergo a double mastectomy for breast cancer and am deciding whether to have breast cancer reconstruction surgery. would the surgery leave my breasts feeling hard and unnatural? i might ch
there are many options available to patients needing reconstruction. the most natural way is using your own tissues. a diep flap is the most cutting edge way to achieve this natural result. it is using the abdominal fat /skin only (no muscle - as sacrificing your muscle is a tram). find a diep center as this is a challenging technique that requires experience and expertise.
does tamoxifen help prevent breast cancer?
tamoxifen blocks estrogen and progesterone receptors which when stimulated can cause remnant cancer cells to be stimulated to grow back and also can cause normal cells to be overstimulated to develop into new hormonally sensitive cancer. statistically it reduces the chance of recurrence by 30% and reduces the chance of a second primary by 50%.
does tamoxifen help prevent breast cancer?
the p-1 trial showed in high risk women tamoxifen decreased the risk of er+ tumors by 40-50% (no difference in er- tumors) over palcebo. the p-2 or star trial compared tamoxifen to raloxifene/evista and saw similar overall benefits with some slight variations. recently a new trial has shown 65% reduction benefit for the aromatase inhibitor exemestane over placebo.
does tamoxifen help prevent breast cancer?
tamoxifen also can be used to prevent breast cancer in the other breast as well as "secondary prevention" of breast cancer in patients who are at higher than normal risk of developing breast cancer.
does tamoxifen help prevent breast cancer?
it prevents recurrence in women with estrogen receptor positive tumors.
does tamoxifen help prevent breast cancer?
tamoxifen use may reduce the development of breast cancer in high-risk patients by about 50%. there are risks associated with tamoxifen so the decision whether to take this medication is based upon an individual patient's risk:benefit analysis.
does taking tamoxifen for breast cancer treatment induce development of cancer of the uterus?
the chance is about 1% and treatment is hysterectomy. with such a low chance then tamoxifen is worth the risk. a gynecologist needs to keep track of the patient and any unusual bleeding evaluated. there are also other hormone alternatives with less risk. check with your medical oncologist to see which drug is best for a particular patient.
does taking tamoxifen for breast cancer treatment induce development of cancer of the uterus?
studies show that women who take tamoxifen have twice the risk of uterine cancer as compared to non treated patients. however the benefits of tamoxifen for the treatment of breast cancer far outweigh the risks. aromatase inhibitors are a group of drugs that can be used instead of tamoxifen for post-menopausal breast cancer patients; these drugs do not have this risk.
does postmenopausal hormone therapy lead to breast cancer?
with due respect. the landmark study whi is called into question in so many ways. the nih spent millions to answer very little. as an re i feel there are many facets to hrt and a careful and comprehensive evaluation of the literature supports a very minimal at best increase in breast cancer and the evidence points to the progestin component only (provera). consultation warranted.
does postmenopausal hormone therapy lead to breast cancer?
hormone therapy can be estrogen only or combination estrogen &progesterone (ep). almost all studies show an increase in breast ca in women who take ep. there may be more breast ca dx/'d in women who take e but diagnosed earlier 7 more curable. some type of progesterone is indicated in women w/ a uterus to prevent uterine ca.
does postmenopausal hormone therapy lead to breast cancer?
while not every woman who takes hormone replacement therapy will get breast cancer there is compelling evidence that it's use substantially increases the risk of breast cancer. a landmark study published last decade sponsored by the national cancer institute found a 25% increase in breast cancer in women who took estrogen and progestin.
do breast implants affect mammogram results?
yes. in fact special views are required for patients with implants to increase the ability to visualize the amount of breast tissue that may be obscured by the implants. the good news is that the implants have not been shown to effect survival of patients with breast cancer who have had implants previously placed.
do breast implants affect mammogram results?
studies show that implants cause breast cancer to be detected at later stages than without implants. but implants can decrease breast cancer by around 4 fold. for information see www. thenakedtruthaboutbreastimplants. com.
does pr-negative breast cancer respond to tamoxifen?
tamoxifen is used to treat hormone-sensitive breast cancer. this is determined by checking for estrogen receptors (er) and progesterone receptors (pr) on the cancer. if the cancer is er+ and pr- (or vice-versa) it should respond to tamoxifen. however if the cancer is er- and pr- tamoxifen is not effective.
does pr-negative breast cancer respond to tamoxifen?
if the breast cancer is er + tamoxifen will work- however it will not work if the cancer is er- pr-.
does pr-negative breast cancer respond to tamoxifen?
response to tamoxifen depends on the er (estrogen receptor) status.
does chemotherapy work for breast cancer?
chemo treats the whole body to kill cancer cells that may have escaped from the breast tumor. sometimes chemo is used to shrink the breast tumor before surgery (neoadjuvant chemotherapy). breast cancers that respond best to chemotherapy are those with a high ki-67 (proliferation rate) er negative and/or her2 positive.
does chemotherapy work for breast cancer?
some cancers are more chemotherapy sensitive than others. neoadjuvant therapy in appropriate patients can answer this question and provide additional prognostic information. in the adjuvant setting oncotype dx testing for er+ tumors gives additional biologic information as to which patients get most or all benefit from hormonal therapy and which may truly need/benefit from cytotoxic chemotherapy.
does chemotherapy work for breast cancer?
different regimens for different cancers-that vary with the cancer's hormonal and genetic make - up. - added time of treatment if lymph nodes positive. the biggest breakthrough is with designer targeted drugs eg. herceptin (trastuzumab) aimed at its target her 2 oncogene on selective cancers-- that has a great added response when given with chemotherapy.

elevated prolactin levels have been linked to an increase in breast cancer risk however most women who are not breastfeeding but are producing milk go to the doctor with this complaint leading to dignostic workup and treatment. the risk will be mitigated by the treatment.
does taking tamoxifen for breast cancer treatment cause cancer of the uterus?
tamoxifen has been shown to increase the risk of uterine cancer not unlike estrogen replacement therapy with an incidence of ~1:500. however this is almost-always caught at its earliest stage with very high cure rates. if you compare the benefit of tamoxifen for either treating or preventing breast cancer compared to this risk the benefit far outweighs the risk.

if you get vaginal bleeding you need a biopsy of the endometrium. some doctors do ultrasounds looking for polips as well
do chronic swollen lymph nodes in the arm pit most likely mean breast cancer?
if the lymph nodes are persistent after seeing your doctor and being evaluated for a possible infection and perhaps being treated with a course of antibiotics a consultation with a breast cancer surgeon may be needed. also a proper breast exam with your doctor mammogram and ultrasound should be performed if not already.

but no where near the top. a local infectious or inflammatory process would be more likely. indolent lymphoma and breast cancer possible but unlikely. get it checked out.
do chronic swollen lymph nodes in the arm pit most likely mean breast cancer?
this would not be the first thing that i think of. could be related to infection. you should tell your friendly primary care physician about these symptoms.
do chronic swollen lymph nodes in the arm pit most likely mean breast cancer?
lymph nodes may become enlarged due to many different reasons of which cancer is but one explanation. the first step is to be seen by your doctor who will perform a careful breast exam and order a diagnostic mammogram and ultrasound. based upon these findings an ultrasound-guided biopsy of one of the lymph nodes may be ordered.

the benefits of eating organic food are controversial. there has been no clear link between eating organic and decreasing cancer risk.
does drinking organic milk reduce my risk of breast cancer?
hormones given to women have not been proven to increase risk of breast cancer but most practioners who know about those issues try to stay away from rx if possible. milk not produced organically has hormones so you do the math. my family drinks organic.
does dcis usually turn into invasive breast cancer?
current thought is that if left untreated dcis will develop into invasive breast cancer.
does dcis usually turn into invasive breast cancer?
it is estimated that approximately 10-50% of all cases of dcis if left untreated would progress to invasive cancer. while some subtypes are more aggresive than others it is hard to predict which are more likely to become invasive; therefore our treatment of dcis is geared towards erring on the side of caution and treating all cases as if they could become invasive if left untreated.
does dcis usually turn into invasive breast cancer?
dcis means cancer cells are inside the ducts and have not invaded. in time these cells will cross the duct wall and invade the breast tissues resulting in invasive cancer. sometimes dcis can enlarge and remain in one lesion and not invade. sometime even up to several centimeters. so it does not always lead to invasion. that's why we remove dcis before it does this. but if left alone it would.
does a breast cancer lump usually feel like a single ball or a small clump of balls?
it can be a single lump but not always. if you have concerns only a doctor and breast images with a possible need biopsy can make a definitive diagnosis.

does tamoxifen stop breast cancer from growing?
tamoxifen is an antiestrogen that blocks the ability of breast cancer cells to use estrogen; therefore it is only effective in hormone sensitive (estrogen receptor +) breast cancers. when taken for 5 years tamoxifen has been shown to both stop the growth of cancer cells in breast cancer patients and to prevent the development of breast cancer in women that are at high risk.
does tamoxifen stop breast cancer from growing?
tamoxifen is used as a hormone therapy in the breast cancers that exhibit an estrogen hormone receptor. (er+ tumors).
does getting pregnant reduce the chances of getting breast cancer?
from an epidemiologic standpoint women with more children especially if they had their first pregnancy relatively early in life - develop fewer breast cancers. however the risk reduction is moderate at best. better ways to reduce risk: exercise avoidance of too much alcohol keeping to a weight that is normal for your height avoiding high fat foods and too kuch red meat. (and get mammogram.

fullterm or live birth age 30 or younger is somewhat protective for breast cancer; nursing the baby for over 6+ months is also protective; notice i said protective no "preventative".
does getting pregnant reduce the chances of getting breast cancer?
based on population data women who have not had children are at a higher lifetime risk of developing breast cancer.
does tamoxifen use cause ovarian cancer?
tamoxifen has not been associated with ovarian cancer. however it has been associated with a 1 in 300 risk of uterine cancer. the benefit of decrease in breast cancer far outweighs the risk of uterine cancer. the recommendation is to do a biopsy if you have bleeding on tamoxifen.
does having my womb/uterus taken out decrease my chances of breast cancer?
taking the uterus out would not affect your risk of breast cancer but if you are premenopausal taking the ovaries out would lower your risk. this of course also has drawbacks(sudden menopause and all it's associated symptoms: hotflashes mood changes bone thinning). i would only recommend this if there is a genetic predisposition for breast or ovarian cancer.
does having my womb/uterus taken out decrease my chances of breast cancer?
having a hysterectomy does not decrease your risk of breast cancer. in some cases - removal of the ovaries may decrease your risk - but not if replacement hormones are given.

how can you tell if you have breast cancer male.?
there will be a lump under or near a nipple probably not painful. any such bump deserves evaluation by a physician.
how to determine if i have breast cancer w/o going to the doctors?
in essence the best way to find a breast cancer is before anyone can feel it and before it has spread from the breast into lymph nodes lung bone brain etc. that is why mammography is advised. we want to find the small cancers that neither you nor your doctor can feel because there is a better chance that the cancers have not spread.
how can breast cancer continue to kill in mass numbers?
is a difficult disease. we have made great strides in treating many cancers especially hodgkin lymphoma and childhood cancers but unless detected early before it has spread it more likely than not will eventually cause the patient's death. in 2011 approx 230 000 cases of invasive and approx 58 000 cases of non invasive breast cancer were diagnosed in the us with approx 39 000 deaths.

mammogram sonogram possible mri and biopsy if a lesion is suspicios.
how can i tell if a woment is suffering from breast cancer after mammoplasty?
breast cancer is typically found on a mammogram. if a reduction has been done this can sometimes distort the tissue making evaluation more difficult. after implants a small cancer could be obscured. however special views are performed to try to see all the tissue by displacing the implant during mammography.
how can the doctor check you for breast cancer?
is where a doctor starts including a family history. the physical includes a breast exam both sitting up and lying down. given your age a screening mammogram would be the usual next step assuming the history and physical did not reveal anything concerning. then see what the mammogram results are. you should perform breast self exam every month in the shower - ask your doctor for instruction.
how can you prevent breast cancer?
there are many known and unknown factors for the risk of breast cancer - these include genetic factors gender age age when menstrual cycles started history of radiation exposure to the chest area. these factors cannot be modified. so the risk factors that you can modify are: being overweight excessive use of alcohol and smoking. most importantly do breast exams and get your mammogram.

how many chemotherapy cycles before we can tell whether it is working or not? (fec protocol stage iii breast cancer)
if you get it before surgery to shrink the tumor you can usually see a change after 2 or 3 sometimes even with just one. if you are getting it after the surgery (adjuvant) to keep it from coming back then there is no way you can tell short term if it did the job. only time will tell if the tumor relapses or not. good luck either way and best regards.
how dangerous can stage 4 breast cancer that has mets to lungs and adrenal gland be if it goes untreated without chemo?
among all patients with breast cancer who present with distant disease one fourth will survive beyond 5 years. it would be good to know the patient's age and receptor status (er pr her2) to answer this question because we are finding much better results now with certain treatments (like herceptin (trastuzumab) for her2+ pts) than in the past. ask your oncologist for info.
how dangerous can stage 4 breast cancer that has mets to lungs and adrenal gland be if it goes untreated without chemo?
cancer that is so aggressive and wide spread is not likely to regress or give up on it's own. without any chemo it may spread rapidly through the lung and to more organs. even with chemo rx there may not be much help with such an advanced cancer.
how dangerous can stage 4 breast cancer that has mets to lungs and adrenal gland be if it goes untreated without chemo?
cancer is likely to lead to death regardless of treatment. ask about benefit of chemo vs. toxicity and appropriateness of hospice.
have bilateral breast tenderness for six months. getting ultrasound and mammogram. is breast cancer the primary concern with these symptoms.
breast cancer is typically not tender and is not likely to be bilateral in a male patient(does happen in female breast cancer but it is very rare).
have bilateral breast tenderness for six months. getting ultrasound and mammogram. is breast cancer the primary concern with these symptoms.
breast tenderness particularly bilateral would be an unlikely presentation of cancer of the breast. more likely it is painful gynecomastia due to meds or hormonal changes. that being said i agree with having it worked out men can have breast cancer. hope it turns out well for you.
have bilateral breast tenderness for six months. getting ultrasound and mammogram. is breast cancer the primary concern with these symptoms.
it is most likely gynecomastia.
have bilateral breast tenderness for six months. getting ultrasound and mammogram. is breast cancer the primary concern with these symptoms.
should be ruled out so the mammogram and ultrasound is a good idea. bilateral breast pain or tenderness in a 73 year old male is likely gynecomastia.
had ultrasound and mammogram 4 bilteral male breast tenderness had for 6 mths. why do both? are either gynecomastia or cancer possible?
ultrasound is useful at detecting cystic changes and mammogram x-ray is better at detecting calcifications and solid mass. given your age and the symptoms you describe it is not unusual to have both exams performed. hormonal level blood test may also be done as part of the work up. gynecomastia or pseudogynecomastia are more likely but 1% of all breast cancer does occur in men so cant be ignored
had ultrasound and mammogram 4 bilteral male breast tenderness had for 6 mths. why do both? are either gynecomastia or cancer possible?
men can get breast cancer. men make up 1% of all breast cancers. bilateral makes it more likely to be gynecomastia but sometimes removal is the only way to know for sure.
how common are breast cyst and could a 20 year old get breast cancer?
breast cysts are fairly common and many women experience it during their life time. cyst are generally benign especially if they are designated as simple cysts. as far as breast cancer at age 20 it is rare but not impossible. if there is any question about an abnormal breast finding or symptom it would be best to check with a breast care professional for appropriate work-up.

the best things you can do include avoiding estrogen-progesterone pills smoking and radiation exposure. exercise a healthy diet and avoidance of alcohol will further reduce the risk. a summary of a recent epidemiological study can be found below: <link>
how can you reduce breast cancer risk?
to reduce risk of getting cancer: lifestyle choices like eating well avoiding obesity exercising and limiting alcohol intake may help. preventative tamoxifen or evista (raloxifene) are used in a select group of high risk patients and in very high risk patients (like brca carriers) there is the option of preventative mastectomies. to reduce risk of dying of cancer: screening mammos self exams and md exams.
how can you reduce breast cancer risk?
screening mammograms & self exams help reduce risk.
how do you boost your chances of surviving breast cancer?

how do you boost your chances of surviving breast cancer?
breast cancer is still a surgical disease. having an excellent breast surgeon and an excellent plastic surgeon to perform and reconstruction necessary.
how do you boost your chances of surviving breast cancer?
three respected colleagues have answered this slightly differently but all are correct. prevention and early detection (healthy lifestyle self exams -i'm also old fashioned- mammos etc. ) are vital. if you get it you need good doctors. i would agree that the "main course" for breast cancer therapy is surgical but may i suggest that a multidisciplinary approach is best.
how do doctors tell if a man has breast cancer?
a woman in most case but an obese man may have flabby pectoral fat. . asymmetry palpable hard lump and more common in older men. usually a mammo is done than a biopsy. many boys develop gynecomastia during puberty - leave this alone. some medication produces this usually bilateral. some testis tumors also produce. go to a doctor to distinguish and find out.
hi i have breast cancer it came back in my chest wall?
for locoregional recurrence the mass needs to be biopsied and work-up to rule out distant metastases should be done. if mastectomy was performed during the original treatment a wide local excision of the recurrent mass should be performed (if possible) as well as axillary lymph node dissection and chest wall radiation (if was not done already) + adjuvant chemo/hormonal therapy.
hi i have breast cancer it came back in my chest wall?
to prove that it is a recurrence? if that's the case you should talk with your oncologist about whether radiation to that area and/or other therapies would be helpful.
how to tell if you have breast cancer male?
breast cancer in men usually presents as a palpable lump. an ultrasound +/- needle biopsy can usually clarify the situation quickly.
how to tell if you have breast cancer male?
while breast cancer is not common in men it does sometimes happen. history and physical examination from a healthcare provider is the best place to start. a doc could help to distinguish gynecomastia (growth of benign breast tissue in men) from cancer. if needed imaging studies and/or a biopsy could be performed to confirm benign versus malignant diagnosis. don't wait. see a doc & find out.
how has breast cancer treatment improved over time?
in many ways it has improved. first of all withearlier detection there is less need of less aggressive excisions and chemo and radiotherapy. have many advances in chemotherapy for example it is a lot more targeted to specific receptors on the cancer.
how has breast cancer treatment improved over time?
progress is achieved in recent years but still long way to reach the goal the cure due to awareness early diagnosis improved diagnostic tools ( better mammography mri etc ) improved knowledge in biology of tumor genetics availability and advances in chemotherapy and more and financial contribution for research by people like you.
how to tell if i have breast cancer at 17?
get mammogram and biopsy if indicated. highly unlikely at 17

size of breast does not correlate with risk of cancer.
heard that massaging pomegranate seed oil into my breast would prevent breast cancer but would eating pomegranate also prevent breast cancer?
there is no scientific evidence that rubbing seed oil or eating pomegranate will prevent breast or any other cancer or disease.
how long do breast cancer spread if not treated?
breast cancer should be evaluated by mammogram us and biopsy. with this information the type of breast cancer the cellular activity and hormonal receptor status can be evaluated which aid your breast surgeon medical oncologist and radiation oncologist guide you through the process. if you need a mastectomy a plastic surgeon with breast reconstruction experience should be consulted.
how long do breast cancer spread if not treated?
i assume you're asking how long it takes before breast cancer begins to spread when not treated. that's a good question. it depends on many factors such as the type of breast cancer and how aggressively the cancer behaves. there is tremendous variation which ranges anywhere from a month to many years. i hope this helps.
how long do breast cancer spread if not treated?
breast cancer remains localized to the breast for a finite yet unpredictable period of time before they begin to spread first to the regional lymph nodes in the armpit and later into the internal organs of the body. once cancer begins to spread(metastasize) they keep spreading unchecked unless you receive treatment with chemotherapy or hormonal therapy which could kill the spread cancer cells.
how will i know breast cancer hormone therapy is working?
if you are receiving hormonal therapy for metastatic breast cancer you will hopefully notice improvement in symptoms from the cancer or by seeing an improvement on another scan. if you are taking hormonal therapy to minimize the chance of recurrence there is no way to know how well it is working for you as an individual. however many studies prove that it decreases the chance of recurrence.
how will i know breast cancer hormone therapy is working?
may be given to treat overt measurable disease in er++ tumors and if you had symptomss or tests showing disease these willl iimprove. . adjuvant use is commonly giveen ffor 5 years. surviving disease free is proof.
i've breast implants (12yrs) & notice lumps inner cleavage on 1 breast that disappear when i press firmly during self exam. rippling or cancer fear?
it is reassuring that the lumps disappear with compression. they could easily be droplets of? silicone from an implant rupture. however breast tissue does remain in the breast after implants are placed. 33 years of age would be very young to have breast cancer but we all know it does happen. see your doctor for evaluation; appropriate breast imaging will help identify the cause of the lumps.
i've had a fiber tumor in my breast before and got it removed. now my breast constantly hurt. could i have breast cancer?
given your age. you likely do not have breast cancer but if your breast still hurts after the surgery you should see your doctor about it. sometimes while tissue is healing from surgery it can cause discomfort and usually an anti inflammatory like advil or aleve (naproxen) will help it. feel better.
is there anything that i can do at home to help control/stop my heavy menstral cycles? i can't take bc pills because i've have breast cancer before.
unfortunately there is little that you can do if you have excessively heavy menstrual periods. if you are sure that you are done having children there is a newer minimally invasive procedure that involves placing a balloon inside the uterus and heating water in the balloon to destroy the uterus' inner lining. no lining = no/minimal periods. see a gynecologist. if you take tamoxifen go now!
i'm 26 and worried that the breast biopsy i had will cause breast cancer later in life from the trauma. is this true?
breast biopsies do not cause breast cancer.
i'm 26 and worried that the breast biopsy i had will cause breast cancer later in life from the trauma. is this true?
it is not true. whoever you heard it from is wrong. when we estimate breast cancer risk we consider prior biopsies as a risk factor but it is because a biopsy is done as result of breast findings that can be premalignant not because the biopsy per se increases the risk. if your doctor recommends a biopsy i suggest you get it. at your age is unikely to be cancer but better be safe. best 2u
i am a breast cancer survivor and underwent masectomy mid last year. i am currently taking tamoxifen. is it safe for me to use slendertone abs? pls.
this abdominal belt will unlikely have any effect on your mastectomy and will not interfere with your tamoxifen. i personally believe there are far more better core workout programs but if this is the path you choose for core work your mastectomy should not interfere
i have lump in armpit when i touch it really hurt. do you know how much for surgery cost? and do i need to concern about breast cancer? thank you
most of the time acute painful lumps in the axilla (armpit) are from an infectious cause. this is a swollen lymph node. they swell when they are fighting a bacteria or virus. a scratch by an animal on the arm could cause this. at your age unless you have strong family history of breast cancer it's not likely this is a sign of cancer. however you may need antibiotics so you should see a doc.
i have lump in armpit when i touch it really hurt. do you know how much for surgery cost? and do i need to concern about breast cancer? thank you
a lump or mass in the armpit needs to be evaluated and assessed by your physician urgently.
is breast density a risk factor for breast cancer? mammogram noted "extremely dense breasts".
is a risk factor for breast cancer. the relative risk for extremely dense breasts is about 4x the relative risk of patients with almost entirely fatty breasts and about 1. 6x the rr for "average" density breasts. find out all you need to know at <link>
i have a family history of breast cancer. how worried should i be?
if several members of the family have had breast ca then the braca gene should be examined. if present then there is a familial history. if not then br ca is acquired. that represents 7% of women susceptible each year. doing a monthly self exam and a single mammogram should be sufficient. if mammo neg then repeat at age 40 with montlhy physical and physician exam yearly will be sufficient
i have used anabolic substances in the past and currently. i never had any issues with gyno before and im starting to. breast cancer or gyno?
it sounds like it is high time to stop anabolic steroid use which can cause liver damage. also time to go see your primary care physician for a physical examination. cannot diagnose breast cancer in this venue very easily. please make an appointment. men have a 1% risk of breast cancer in the general population.
i have a lump rite at the dark spot on my nipple and i popped it and clear liquid came out? it hurts a lot. should i be worried about breast cancer?
cancer of the breast is detected as a firm lesion on palpation or clustered microca representing dcis on mammogram. a dark spot on the nipple probably represents a small clotted area from the nipple. the latter is the confluence of milk ducts of the breast terminating as the nipple. fluid evaporates every day from the nipple and if clotted and the latter then removed fluid will drain.
i'm 28 female and my left breast is heavy aching. i'm not on any tablets or contraception not pregnant. i'm worried it's breast cancer?
it is not feasible to provide a meaningful opinion without taking additional history physical examination and may be some tests. it would be prudent to see your doctor. it is less likely to be cancer and an infection is more likely. however i urge you to see your doctor.
is her2 better if negative or positive in regards to breast cancer?
her2 receptor testing (along with estrogen and progesterone receptor testing) is done on breast cancer tissue to help guide the oncologist for endocrine chemotherapy. it's better if tissues are positive in each case as this increases the treatment choices. if all three are negative (triple negative breast cancer) the prognosis for cure is diminished.
is breast cancer in women under 40 with no additional risks (at average risk) uncommon? roughly how many?
the risk of breast cancer in the years 30-40 is. 44 % (one in 227 women). see: <link> high fat high protein diets increase the risk of breast cancer. one study: walk a mile a day reduce risks of some cancers inc. breast by up to 40% percent. see: <link>
i often do stairs as a form of exercise (repeat up/down). is this one way i can reduce my risk of breast ca (by physical activity)? or not enough?
to boost immunity is helpful for prevention in general so your exercise is good. as your doc to check your vitamin d level which is also an immune booster and may people have low d. a new study suggests that statin medication for high cholesterol is associated w/breast cancer. as your doc about that. manage stress because stress depresses immunity. peace and good health.
is breast cancer caused by a mutation in the gene or by a problem with the gene expression?
if not a genetically inherited environmental conditions initiate the induction of the breast lesion. the most common mutation occurs with the long terminal repeat of the mmtv virus enters the wnt-1 gene. this produces an over expression of b-catenin which results in transformation. ebv infection probably needed for fgarat production that acts to overexpress telomerase inducing immortality.
i have breast cancer-her 2 positive progesterone & estrogen positive. on my health record it shows i have breast cancer (hcc). what does hcc mean?
does it say ihc? immunohistochemistry. immunohistochemistry is an array of stains used to confirm a specific type of cancer. they probably used this to tell if estrogen and progesterone positive. hope this helps.
im a breast cancer positive stage 1 with her2 positive is completly necesary the chemotherapy in my case?
it really depends on your risk factors and tumor characteristics. you should have a through consultation with a medical oncologist to determine the best course.
ive had breast cancer doing great 10 yrs free but i have pain on left side where the breast was removed (scare tissue) what can i take for the pain?
on your successful treament of breast cancer. are you continuing your follow-ups with your doctors/surgeon? are you continuing to do monthly self breast exams? you have been cancer free 10 years lets keep it that way! if you have not been seen by your doctor/surgeon since the pain began - go to them to be checked! please! if it is pain due to scar tissue aleve (naproxen) or motrin should be adequate.
if i were to get my breasts removed would i still be able to get breast cancer?
removal of healthy breasts in a fully developed woman essentially prevents one from getting breast cancer. it is possible that small amounts of breast tissue remain unless the underlying pectorals muscle is removed. in the above case one assumes that there is no abnormal tissue in the breasts before removal.
if i were to get my breasts removed would i still be able to get breast cancer?
women at high genetic risk for breast cancer who opt for prophylactic mastectomies still have a small rate of breast cancer. if there is quite a bit of breast cancer in your family especially early you may want to be tested for brca mutations. it's most important for you to know however that death from breast cancer is uncommon among women who self-examine faithfully & get screened.
if i were to get my breasts removed would i still be able to get breast cancer?
if all your breast tissue was completey removed it would be less likely you would get breast cancer. please speak with your parents first if this is your intention.
is cancerous breast lump single or there may b two cancerous lumps in breast.?
hi. if you have a genetic risk for breast cancer (e. g. one of the brca gene mutations and other genes too) multifocal breast cancer is more likely than in sporadic cases of breast cancer. overall multifocal breast cancer at the time of diagnosis is uncommon. given your age of 25 i would lean heavily toward suspecting a genetic form of breast cancer. evaluate all breast lumps. good luck!
if my breasts feel sore and painful is it likely that i have breast cancer?
but you should have regular breast examination by your doctor and annual mammography including self examination of breast like any woman of your age.
it hurts when i touch under my boobs. is this a sign of breast cancer?
breast cancer is essentially a painless mass growing in breast tissue. it is best felt and distinguished when lying down with the effected side having the arm placed behind the head. using the oppositie hand one then feels a firm lump which really doesn't move around. pain under the breast crease especially when sitting up is usually inflammation in tissue in the region of the breast crease.
i'm 25 years old. i just discovered i have a septated cyst sized 9*4 mm in breast. my grandmother and aunt just got breast cancer. what's your advice?
if the septation is thin then the chance of malignancy is near zero. if the septation is thick irregular or vascular then the lesion is more suspicious and biopsy may be necessary. so more information about the septated cyst is needed.
is stage 2 pancreatic cancer in one person any more serious than stage 2 breast cancer in another person?
hello pancreatic cancer and breast cancer are 2 completely different disease. stage for stage breast cancer usually has a better prognosis than pancreatic cancer. there are a few rare exceptions: such as certain subtypes of pancreatic cancer so please discuss this with your oncologist. if you have a more specific question that you'd like addressed please post it. thank you.
i am a breast cancer survivor and am having increasing pain in my shoulder and hip bone on my affected side i had a double mastectomy 2011?
to have your health checked to determine the causes of this pain. are you getting regular follow up s/p your surgery?
is mastitis normal during pregnancy?
mastitis during breastfeeding is not normal but is certainly very common. it is caused by overgrowth of bacteria in milk-containing ducts. it is managed with oral antibiotics and continuation of breast feeding to empty the milk ducts. mastitis while breastfeeding is not a sign of breast cancer.
my nipples are cracking during feeding. is this breast cancer?
that persists after a few wks should be biopsies but it sounds like chapping.
my nipples are cracking during feeding. is this breast cancer?
cracking nipples during breast feeding is often related to the minor trauma of feeding. however in rare cases changes in the skin of the nipple can be related to a type of breast cancer called paget's disease. have your medical profession examine you and monitor.
my breast cancer came back after 13 years - has radiation and chemotherapy improved since then?
new chemotherapy agents have been introduced. there are also newer types of rmachines and techniques. however in regards to radiation if you had the same exact problem now versus 13 years ago the treatment might be exactly the same.
my breast cancer came back after 13 years - has radiation and chemotherapy improved since then?
i'm sorry your breast cancer came back. yes chemo and radiation have both improved in the last 13 years. radiation is more targeted with new techniques and there are many more chemotherapy drugs to choose from that are less toxic. medications to prevent side effects like nausea are also greatly improved.
my breast cancer came back after 13 years - has radiation and chemotherapy improved since then?
greetings from waco. sorry to hear your cancer relapsed. if there is any consolation know that the fact it took so long to come back suggests it should respond well to therapy (i'm assuming it is er positive). also know that cancer treatment has definitely improved and continues to do so. fight well and best to you.
my breast cancer came back after 13 years - has radiation and chemotherapy improved since then?
vast improvements have been made over the last 13 years in the treatment of breast cancer.
my friend has breast cancer. she says she needs a sentinel lymph node biopsy. what is that?
a sentinel node biopsy means removing several lymph nodes in the chain of armpit lymph nodes. blue dye and/or radioactivity is injected into the breast. the first armpit lymph nodes that "light up" are removed and examined for cancer cells. we know that cancer cells travel through lymph nodes in order. if the sentinel lymph nodes are negative the others are assumed to be negative as well.
my friend has breast cancer. she says she needs a sentinel lymph node biopsy. what is that?
this is a surgical procedure to identify the first node that receives drainage from the site of the cancer and is thus the node most likely to have cancer if cancer has spread. it is done routinely for breast cancer. the node is removed and examined under the microscope for cancer. the results will help determine what additional treatments may be needed.
my friend has breast cancer. she says she needs a sentinel lymph node biopsy. what is that?
this is a surgical procedure that is usually performed at the same time as the breast procedure. a radiotracer and/or blue dye is injected into the breast. these travel through the lymphatic system and stop in the first draining lymph node. a small incision is made in the armpit and the surgeon removes the lymph node that has the blue dye and the radiotracer. this node is studied for cancer.
my friend has breast cancer. she says she needs a sentinel lymph node biopsy. what is that?
with invasive cancer ax nodes are often the 1st site away from the breast. staging used to be removing the ax fat pad w/12-15 nodes. as most pts are node neg at dx removing the 1st node(s) in the chain (sentinel or predictive) gives the same or better staging info wi/less morbidity. these nodes are mapped by dye injection at surgery which travels to the nodes as cancer cells would potentially.
my screening mammogram turned out to be negative but my doctor says i need a breast exam. why?
complementary examinations. both are important in a comprehensive breast health evaluation. a small percentage of breast cancers are found on physical examination and not seen on mammography.
my doctor ordered a second mammogram and it's still not clear if anything is wrong. what's next?
the first step to screening for breast cancer is a screening mammogram. many times more images are needed. this is called a diagnostic mammogram. if it is still unclear the next step is a breast sonogram or a breast mri and evaluation by an experienced breast surgeon.
my girlfriend is 21 years old and she is having breast pain?
a doctor can evaluate a 21 year-old woman with breast pain to see if it is related to trauma cysts hormonal changes (menstrual cycle birth control pills pregnancy) shingles (chickenpox virus) cancer etc. . breast cancer is uncommon in young women but it happens to a some unlucky women every year.
my doctor has recommended chemotherapy prior to a lumpectomy due to the size of the tumor in my left breast. common practice? microscopic diagnosis:invasive ductual carcinoma macroscopic diagnosis: three cores of intermingled glistening gray & yellow
neoadjuvant chemotherapy is a common treatment for locally advanced breast cancer and has been proven to have significant effect to reduce the size of the breast cancer in some patients the surgical management can be a lumpectomy and not a mastectomy.
my daughter has a lump on her breast and i was wandering is she too young for breast cancer?
breast cancer increases in incidence the older a person is. for example teenagers have a "one in a million" chance of getting breast cancer; the probability increases slightly in your 20's. that said all breast lumps should be evaluated by a doctor.
my daughter has a lump on her breast and i was wandering is she too young for breast cancer?
this depends on several factors including family/genetics. while this is a possibility it is highly unlikely. benign breast masses are very common in young women. in particularly thin women normal breast tissue can feel like a mass. pay close attention and do not ignore and discuss with your primary care physician. call sooner for a changing or growing mass or one associated with discharge
my daughter has a lump on her breast and i was wandering is she too young for breast cancer?
while breast cancer is less frequent in younger women it can occur. your daughter should be examined by a physician.
my mother passed away from breast cancer also had a cousin on my fathers side had both breast removed because of cancer i have been having swelling?
your family history is worrisome (especially if your mother and cousin were premenopausal or there are other family members with breast ovarian uterine prostate or colon cancers). you might want to see a specialist. if you are found to be at increased genetic risk you may need more aggressive screening with an mri. for very high risk patients preventative drugs or surgery may be suggested.
my mother passed away from breast cancer also had a cousin on my fathers side had both breast removed because of cancer i have been having swelling?
if you have not had routine breast cancer screening (mammograms and breast exams by a health care professional) you should have those. if your mother had breast cancer you may have a higher risk of breast cancer. if you notice any abnormality on a self breast exam you need to see your doctor.
my mother just passed away from a breast cancer called her 2. it is evidently a rare type of cancer. what else can you tell me about this cancer?
i am sorry for your loss. her 2 stands for human epidermal growth factor receptor. this is a protein that is present on approximately 20% of all breast cancers. these cancers tend to be more aggressive; however there are targeted therapies with drugs such as herceptin (trastuzumab) that can be very effective.
my mother just passed away from a breast cancer called her 2. it is evidently a rare type of cancer. what else can you tell me about this cancer?
i'm so sorry you lost your mother to breast cancer. her2 is the name of a protein found on 20% of breast cancers. it used to be the worst sub-type of breast cancer but now there are drugs like herceptin (trastuzumab) that target her2+ breast cancers so the prognosis has improved. it's still an aggressive breast cancer as you have sadly learned. take care of yourself! to learn more: www. her2support. org.
my dad just overcame skin prostate and kidney cancer. and my mom had breast cancer 3 times. and my cousin has brain cancer? how high is my risk?
kat13 your biggest risk is likely breast cancer. if your mom was diagnosed before she was 50 your risk is higher for breast cancer than it would be otherwise. there are some genetic cancer syndromes that increase risk for brain kidney and breast cancer. ask your doctor to refer you to a genetic counselor who can investigate your family history further and guide you re: genetic testing.
my dad just overcame skin prostate and kidney cancer. and my mom had breast cancer 3 times. and my cousin has brain cancer? how high is my risk?
many cancers have a genetic link so it is best to let your doctor know so they can screen you earier. the cancers you are mentioning do very well typically when caught early. by screening earlier hopefully you'd catch anything before it became a problem.
my dad just overcame skin prostate and kidney cancer. and my mom had breast cancer 3 times. and my cousin has brain cancer? how high is my risk?
did your mother undergo genetic testing for the brca gene mutations? this would be important information regarding your risk of breast cancer. you should being breast cancer screening 5 - 10 years prior to when she developed breast cancer or at age 40 whichever comes first.
my dad just overcame skin prostate and kidney cancer. and my mom had breast cancer 3 times. and my cousin has brain cancer? how high is my risk?
there are some links between prostate and breast cancer. the others not so much. you might want to ask your parents to discuss genetics evaluation to see if there is a genetic predisposition to cancer. otherwise not clear if your risk is different.
my dad just overcame skin prostate and kidney cancer. and my mom had breast cancer 3 times. and my cousin has brain cancer? how high is my risk?
a positive family history places you at higher risk than the average person. skin prostate and breast can be screened for. for kidney and brain cancer no screening guidelines exist.
my dad's mom had breast cancer and now my mom had breast cancer. even though i am not yet 40 should i have a mammogram?
i recommend you seek out a high risk breast program or specialist to do an extensive family history to determine when and what type of screening is indicated.
my dad's mom had breast cancer and now my mom had breast cancer. even though i am not yet 40 should i have a mammogram?
you should ask your doctor to refer you to a genetic counselor to evaluate your long term risk for breast cancer. depending on your risk there may be a role for genetic testing for genetic predisposition for breast cancer in your or your mother. in some cases it makes sense to do annual breast mris as they are more sensitive than mammography in younger women.
my dad's mom had breast cancer and now my mom had breast cancer. even though i am not yet 40 should i have a mammogram?
i'm sure that it feels that you have a "double dose" of risk but if these are your only family members with breast (or ovarian) ca you are not high-risk for hereditary breast ca (we tend to see this type in families with multiple members with ca especially prior to menopause or when in both breasts) & can wait till 40. that said a mammogram is a small price to pay for peace of mind.
my dad's mom had breast cancer and now my mom had breast cancer. even though i am not yet 40 should i have a mammogram?
a comprehensive risk assessment then you and your doctor can assess whether it would be appropriate to begin early screening.
my dad's mom had breast cancer and now my mom had breast cancer. even though i am not yet 40 should i have a mammogram?
i really don't have enough famiy history but baseline mammograms can be done between 35-40 years anyway-without extra family history. please also note if you ever feel unusual senastions-unequally in your breast-not pain really but tingling in onebreast that persists for month - any nipple dischatge esp only in one breast. go to a physician/ medical center known for tx/prev. of breast disorders.
my dad's mom had breast cancer and now my mom had breast cancer. even though i am not yet 40 should i have a mammogram?
generally patients who have a first degree relative should start annual mammograms starting at an age 10 years younger than your mother was when she was diagnosed. i would recommend you start.
my nipples are leaking what looks like breast milk i'm male and 19 this is the 1st time its happened i'm also on tamoxifen if this helps now for 1 w?
are you on tamoxifen for breast cancer or for countering the effects of anabolic steroids (used by some bodybuilders)? i find no listing of galactorrhea (breast milk) as a side effect of tamoxifen; however it can be caused by a number of other medications or by a tumor of the pituitary gland. see your doctor to discuss these symptoms & for his advice for further evaluation.
my friend who has breast cancer gets her tumor markers checked my mother also had breast cancer what are the markers and could i get checked?
just don't work that well (outside of a few very specific tumors that don't include breast cancer) and should not be used to screen for cancer in someone without the disease. the odds are that any positive test would be a falsely positive. as far as what tumor markers are used for breast cancer none are used routinely and i'd ask your friend what the markers her docs are using.
my friend who has breast cancer gets her tumor markers checked my mother also had breast cancer what are the markers and could i get checked?
if you have strong family history of breast cancer then you can ask your doc about testing. usually what happens is someone with cancer gets tested. if positive then testing offered to other family members. as cost comes down will probably test more people.
my friend has 4th stage breast cancer her lungs are filling up with tumors why wouldn't her docs give her an oxygen bottle to use whenever needed?
oxygen would only be helpful if her oxygen levels are low. this is easily checked at the md's office and it may be that even though your friend has multiple metastasis she does not have low oxygen levels.
my friend has 4th stage breast cancer her lungs are filling up with tumors why wouldn't her docs give her an oxygen bottle to use whenever needed?
many patients with lung problems or cancer in their lungs can still get enough oxygen in their blood without supplemental oxygen. they may feel short of breath but if the oxygen level is not low giving more oxygen is not necessarily the answer. for most insurances to pay for home oxygen oxygen saturations must be documented at less than 88%.
my friend has 4th stage breast cancer her lungs are filling up with tumors why wouldn't her docs give her an oxygen bottle to use whenever needed?
i don't know. the importance is keeping her comfortable. if oxygen makes her comfortable---so be it. there is no medical reason not to. does she have hospice involved? they are very knowledgable in end of life care for the patient family and friends. if the docs will not cooperate find new physcians. if she is continuing her treatment; comfort is still key for a patient.
my friend who has forth stage breast cancer has fluid around her lungs tumers inside her lungs and is tired. could oxygen therapy help her at all?
oxygen level can be easily tested and so i would do that first. if it is low supplemental oxygen can be quite helpful. if too much fluid she may need to get treatment to remove the excess fluid otherwise oxygen may not get to the lungs to cross to the blood where she needs it.
my friend who has forth stage breast cancer has fluid around her lungs tumers inside her lungs and is tired. could oxygen therapy help her at all?
as dr. bessmer stated it can be checked to see if oxygen is low by use a pulse oximeter (you just place it on the finger at get a reading) it should be in the mid to high 90's. otherwise oxygen bottles or generators can be ordered by your doctor. sometimes the o2 level is good resting but walking it gets real low so it can be tested when walking as well.
my gynecologist prescribed bioidentical hrt and said that i can stay on it "indefinitely" without increased risk of breast cancer. do you agree?
i think there may some controversy as to the long-term safety of any estrogen. in theory your estrogen is more easily broken down (metabolized) by your liver and theoretically safer but long term studies comparing one form with another are not yet available to the best of my knowledge.
my gynecologist prescribed bioidentical hrt and said that i can stay on it "indefinitely" without increased risk of breast cancer. do you agree?
you can get breast cancer with or without bioidentical hormone treatment. if you do get it being on any estrogens could make it worse depending on the kind of breast cancer you get. so i would still insist upon routine breast exams and mammograms to follow you. bioidentical hrt can be extremely helpful and life changing in a good way but everything has risks.
my gynecologist prescribed bioidentical hrt and said that i can stay on it "indefinitely" without increased risk of breast cancer. do you agree?
i do not agree with that at all. there are very few studies on bioidenticals because they are considered "supplements" and are therefore not regulated by the fda. that should be a bad sign in and of itself. the studies performed by the naturalist industry are all industry sponsored not published in major peer reviewed journals and frequently without adequate controls. do your research 1st!
my sister was diagnosed with stage one breast cancer at 42. no family history and she isbrca negative. should i be on hormone free birth control?
there is no present scientific information to make a definitive conclusion. sometimes it's difficult for us to agile a simple yes or no answer. however i think that it would be the safest for you to avoid excessive estrogen in any medication you might take.
my sister was diagnosed with stage one breast cancer at 42. no family history and she isbrca negative. should i be on hormone free birth control?
i'm sorry to hear about your sister. unfortunately there is conflicting data regarding long-term risk of breast cancer associated with bcp use; however one study in particular found the risk higher in women with strong family histories and bcp use. therefore if at all possible i would suggest an alternative.
my sister was diagnosed with stage one breast cancer at 42. no family history and she isbrca negative. should i be on hormone free birth control?
taking unopposed estrogen does increase your risk of developing breast cancer.
my friends lungs are full of tumers from forth stage breast cancer she is having coughing fits and her docs haven't given her oxygen therapy why not?
it sounds like your friend is quite ill but she may not oxygen yet. this is quite easily determined in an office setting with a pulse-oximetry meter. if she is having shortness of breath easy fatigue etc. it is reasonable to check her oxygen status. treating her coughs may make her more comfortable. advise her to consult her docs. wish her luck for me.
my friends lungs are full of tumers from forth stage breast cancer she is having coughing fits and her docs haven't given her oxygen therapy why not?
oxygen is only needed if a persons blood oxygen is below a certain level the treatment of symptoms is not oxygen unless a person is not able to keep a good level of oxygen without supplement so if your friend has a po2 of >90 without oxygen he may not need any.
my friends lungs are full of tumers from forth stage breast cancer she is having coughing fits and her docs haven't given her oxygen therapy why not?
oxygen will not stop the cough. it may help her feel a bit better but a strong cough med is probably indicated. is hospice needed? they do a wonderful job of helping when conditions seem bleak or unsolvable to usual care.
my friends lungs are full of tumers from forth stage breast cancer she is having coughing fits and her docs haven't given her oxygen therapy why not?
oxygen can only be prescribed if her oxygen level is low enough to warrant this therapy. so your friend's oxygen level is likely not low enough. her doctors will likely monitor this and prescribe it if/when necessary (her pulse ox needs to be below 88% on room air to qualify). i am very sorry about your friend's illness. best of luck to both of you!
my sister got a mammogram result of "suspicious cluster microcalcifications". is that a cancer sign?
microcalcification can be a sign of breast cancer. there are however many calcification of the breast that are benign. malignant type calcifications are usually tightly grouped very small and heterogeneous in configuration. if a good mammographer is suspicious as to a group of calcifications they should be biopsied. i have seen cases of false negative mri of breast with malignant calcification.
mammogram with punctate pleomorphic calcifications. is that breast cancer?
although breast calcifications may not necessarily mean cancer pleomorphic calcifications are suspicious. a biopsy should be done. talk to your doctor. pleomorphism means that something is of varying shape and characteristics. a non-cancerous or benign calcification will be read as "benign-appearing". don't delay your biopsy.
mammogram with punctate pleomorphic calcifications. is that breast cancer?
microcalcifications are usually described as either punctate (benign) or pleomorphic (in determinant to suspicious) not both. ultimate definitive diagnosis may require tissue sampling that is best done via stereotactic guided core biopsy. see a breast surgeon for further evaluation.
mammogram with punctate pleomorphic calcifications. is that breast cancer?
usually calcifications do not mean cancer and are not themselves cancerous. however tight clusters of microcalcifications are seen with breast cancer. many times a repeat mammogram would be done in about 6 months to see if there are changes. if there were a biopsy would be done. at this point it would appear that no suspect changes are noted. check with your doctor to be sure.
mammogram with punctate pleomorphic calcifications. is that breast cancer?
be sure it's cancer until it's biopsied. "punctate" and "pleomorphic" are mutually exclusive terms so the description of the microcalcifications doesn't make sense. it's like calling something square and round at the same time. it is impossible. moreover punctate usually implies benignity and pleomorphic is suspicious. were they called suspicious? was a biopsy recommended?
mammogram with punctate pleomorphic calcifications. is that breast cancer?
probably need biopsy. see breast surgeon.
my kids are upset i never had colonoscopy or mammogram. healthy and 88. why should i bother now?
its a judgment call if at 88 you need any of that stuff. congrats on getting to 88 without breast cancer or colons ca! but for every lucky person like yourself there are several who are unlucky who never get tested and it's too late <negative_smiley>.
my mother has breast cancer. will she die?
prognosis of breast cancer will depend on the stage the type/biology of cancers/ other prognostic markers. all of us will die sooner or later. however not everybody with breast cancer will die from the breast cancer. without any information it is hard to say about one's prognosis. please discuss with her oncologist in detail. nobody knows about one's fate- only god knows.
my mother has breast cancer. will she die?
death from breast cancer like for most cancers depends on stage and type of cancer treatment given and the genetic make up of the individual. early breast cancer is curable.
my mother has breast cancer. will she die?
everyone dies but fortunately most people who are diagnosed with breast cancer don't die as a result of their breast cancer.
my mom had estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer should i be taking birth control or getting pregnant?
even a family history of breast cancer should not stop you from having kids especially if you are healthy and cancer free. there are also several treatment options for estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer like tamoxifen. birth control is of course an option if you do not feel ready to have children yet regardless of your family history. get counseling from your doctor to be sure.

if the xray examination of the hip shows bone destruction or increased bone formation. on xray there has to be at least 40% destruction of bone for it to be visible. a normal bone scan is much more sensitive for detecting involvement of bone by tumor. if your bone scan is normal the presence of tumor is unlikely. it is likely that your pain is from benign process such as bursitis or arthritis.
does cancer how up on exrays does cancer show up on exrays exrays taken ofhips they said it was burstisus i am a cancer survivor since 2007 clear test results clear lympnodes clear bone scan clear margins in stsge 1 breast cancer
x-rays can pick up cancer some of the time. for example a chest x-ray can detect lung cancer. a ct scan or mri is more sensitive in picking up cancer than an x-ray. if you like please submit more information. what kind of cancer are you speaking of? what x-rays were done or ordered? good luck.
do i need a pet scan after surviving breast cancer? i had breast cancer (stage 1) and treatment was successful. i just had a mammogram and there was no cancer. treatments were chemotherapy and radiation.
you and your oncologist need to discuss this. given the low stage and assuming successful completion of treatment pet/ct might not be indicated at this time. it does depend on the specifics of your case. pet/ct is useful in evaluating for distal metastatic disease. it does not replace mammography ultrasound or breast mri for local recurrence surveillance
do i need a pet scan after surviving breast cancer? i had breast cancer (stage 1) and treatment was successful. i just had a mammogram and there was no cancer. treatments were chemotherapy and radiation.
if all of your treatment is completed as you are followed by your oncology team with breast exams mammograms and md breast exams pet scan will offer little to no benefit. there r also some blood markets that can be used to evaluate for early recurrence and this merit additional studies. routinely though after treatment for an early stage breast cancers do not require pet scan for surveillance.
do i need a pet scan after surviving breast cancer? i had breast cancer (stage 1) and treatment was successful. i just had a mammogram and there was no cancer. treatments were chemotherapy and radiation.
technically no. but i would still consider getting one ( if you can afford one or if your insurance will consent ) for piece of mind. remember a pet/ct scan covers your head to thigh and could some other non-symptomatic areas of concern.
do i need a pet scan after surviving breast cancer? i had breast cancer (stage 1) and treatment was successful. i just had a mammogram and there was no cancer. treatments were chemotherapy and radiation.
pet scans are not proven to be of use in stage i breast cancer. there is a new type of breast-only pet canning called pem zthat is currently being tested but right now there it also has no established role in monitoring you for recurrence or a new cancer. glad to hear the mammo was clear and wish you the best. for now an annual mammo possibly with an ultrasound is the best testing after treatment for an early stage breast cancer. there are some woman with a particularly higher risk of recurrence or of developing a second new tumor who will also benefit from regular mri scans. ask your doctors if they think you need this too.
does fibrocystic breast diesease increase cancer risk?
fibrocystic breast disease is very common. up to 50% of women have fibrocystic changes. about 1 in 8 women will develope breast cancer which is quite a significant risk. having fibrocystic breast changes does not increase the risk for breast cancer but makes it more difficult to detect. mamograms are the best test for breast cancer and should be done once at age 35 and yearly after the age of 40.
does fibrocystic breast diesease increase cancer risk?
i agree with the others that there is no known association or risk of breast cancer with fibrocystic breast disease.
diagnosed with breast cancer in the fall. partial mas. in oct & 1/2 through radiation. armpit just strarted swelling hurting & chest pain. worry?
it is very common to develop swelling in the chest and armpit following breast cancer surgery and radiation therapy. while this may just be "normal changes" it could be lymphedema. in this situation it is best to return to your breast surgeon so that he/she can examine you. if it is lymphedema physical therapy will be recommended. i hope this helps.
diagnosed with breast cancer in the fall. partial mas. in oct & 1/2 through radiation. armpit just strarted swelling hurting & chest pain. worry?
you could be experiencing lymphedema. radiation is a risk factor for the development of lymphedema after surgery. i recommend you speak with your radiation oncologist and surgeon. you should be evaluated by a lymphedema specialist/physical therapy clinic.
diagnosed with breast cancer in the fall. partial mas. in oct & 1/2 through radiation. armpit just strarted swelling hurting & chest pain. worry?
talk to your radiation oncologist it may all be due to the side effects of radiation. a physical exam is in order to make sure there are no signs of an infection.
diagnosed with breast cancer in the fall. partial mas. in oct & 1/2 through radiation. armpit just strarted swelling hurting & chest pain. worry?
it would be best for you to see your oncologist as soon as possible about this problem. it is common for some swelling to occur during radiation. however it would be best to bring it up with your treatment team at your next appointment.
diagnosed with breast cancer in the fall. partial mas. in oct & 1/2 through radiation. armpit just strarted swelling hurting & chest pain. worry?
definitely see your surgeon and your rad onc. but i'm not too worried. this is not breast cancer returning. it's most likely side effects from radiation + your surgery. many patients have breast/armpit swelling and pain during radiation. i agree with dr. rosen that lymphedema could be developing. another possibility is infection. make sure your rad onc examines you at your next visit!
does having breast discharge while not breastfeeding really means i might have breast cancer? when my left nipple is stimulated a bit it releases a small discharge very similar to that of breastfeeding. i am not pregnant and my daughter is 4yrs so i am no
you may have gala torches where you produce breast milk even though you aren't breast feeding. it can be due to a variety of reasons such as drugs trauma etc. talk to your obstatrician about it.
does having breast discharge while not breastfeeding really means i might have breast cancer? when my left nipple is stimulated a bit it releases a small discharge very similar to that of breastfeeding. i am not pregnant and my daughter is 4yrs so i am no
milky nipple discharge is not related to breast cancer. we check 2 hormone levels. thyroid function and prolactin hormone level. if those are normal there is no medical issue causing the discharge. in that case decreasing nipple stimulation in sex play or in the shower water on the breasts may help. some medications can cause this as well.
does having breast discharge while not breastfeeding really means i might have breast cancer? when my left nipple is stimulated a bit it releases a small discharge very similar to that of breastfeeding. i am not pregnant and my daughter is 4yrs so i am no
nipple discharge can be caused by a malignant lesion if it is spontaneous ie comes out on its own or is bloody if the discharge is milky and only comes out with stimulation then it is benign and i would not be concerned it usually will stop on ts own mention t to your gyn at your next visit.
does having breast discharge while not breastfeeding really means i might have breast cancer? when my left nipple is stimulated a bit it releases a small discharge very similar to that of breastfeeding. i am not pregnant and my daughter is 4yrs so i am no
a breast discharge is one sign of breast cancer. however it can also be caused by infection. the difference between these two diagnoses is obviously very great so you should see your doctor for an evaluation.
do a lot of people get paget's disease of breast?
paget's disease is an uncommon type of breast cancer. less than 5% of breast cancers manifest as paget's disease. about ten to twelve thousand cases are seen every year in the united states.
do a lot of people get paget's disease of breast?
pagets disease of the breast is much less common than other presentations of breast cancer accounting for only 1 to 3 % of new cases of female breast cancer that are diagnosed annually in the united states. it has been described in patients ranging in age from 26 to 88 however the peak incidence is between 50 and 60.
do doctors see a lot of patients with paget's disease of breast?
it is not a common type of breast cancer. so most doctors don't see a lot of patients with this probem. many times the patients may see a dermatologist. the breast surgeons end up seeing most of the patients with paget's disease due to referral from primary care physicians or dermatologists.
do doctors see a lot of patients with paget's disease of breast?
paget disease of the breast is much less common than other presentations of breast cancer. it accounts only 1 to 3 percent of new cases of female breast cancer that are diagnosed annually in the united states.
diagnosed with liver cancer also breast cancer. what is the prognosis?
to have two cancers at once' more likly the breast cancer is the cause of the liver lesion(s). ifthere is doubt a biopsy can be done to verify cell type and establish appropriate treatment including presence of er/pr/her-2-neu - cell surface marker suggesting treatment. liver metastasis can respond but classically less responsive to hormones and not having as favorable outcome to therapy.
diagnosed with liver cancer also breast cancer. what is the prognosis?
i am sorry to hear about your diagnosis. in general when cancer has spread from one organ such as the breast to the liver the chance for cure is low. however the chance for remission is possible and is dependent on the unique "fingerprint" of your cancer which will identify what drugs will be most effective. don't give up hope: many people can live for years if the tumor is chemosensitive.
diagnosed with liver cancer also breast cancer. what is the prognosis?
when a cancer is present in multiple organs it is usually incurable. the circumstance you describe is likely a primary breast cancer that has spread to the liver and it indicates poor prognosis.
doctors can you tell me how often should women get a mammogram?
after forty. baseline 35 or ten years before mothers or relatives breast cancer.
do i have to worry about breast cancer as 70yo male?
if you have a lump in your breast you should be seen by a breast doctor. breast cancer remains very rare in men however it is often diagnosed at an advanced stage due to most men not recognizing the significance of a breast lump.
do i have to worry about breast cancer as 70yo male?
unless there is a family history of similar cancer you need not worry about breast cancer. if you feel a lump in the breast see your doctor.
do i have to worry about breast cancer as 70yo male?
is more frequent in older men than younger men but is so infrequent it is not a major worry. if you detect a lump or change in your breast/nipple area get it checked. you are not likely to get it but not immune because of age.
different types of breast cancer. are some a lot worse than others?
there are several types of breast cancer and some are worse than others for instance a sarcomotoid breast cancer is very aggressive nd resistant to treatment. even within ductal carcinomas (the most common type of breast cancer) we now recognize three separte types luminal (phenobarbital) a luminal (phenobarbital) b and basal with basal being the most aggressive.
different types of breast cancer. are some a lot worse than others?
we're just starting to understand the different types. general categories are er+ er/pr/her2+ er-/her2+ and er/pr/her2-. her2+ tend to be more aggressive but can be counteracted w/herceptin. triple neg are also more aggressive but some of these are very chemosensitive. genomic analysis/microarrays allows further subdividing. the environment of the tumor in the body is also likely critical.
different types of breast cancer. are some a lot worse than others?
there are lots of different subtypes of breast cancer. all have different prognoses and different recommended treatments.
do bras cause breast cancer by not allowing natural cooling of the mammary glands?
i do not believe there is any evidence for bras increasing cancer risk. wear what is pleasing to you aesthetically and comfortably.
do bras cause breast cancer by not allowing natural cooling of the mammary glands?
that was made up in the 1990s by an anti-bra militant. there's no reason to think it's true.
do bras cause breast cancer by not allowing natural cooling of the mammary glands?
that's a myth. women in colder climates also do not have a lower risk for breast cancer than women in tropical climates.
do bras cause breast cancer by not allowing natural cooling of the mammary glands?
there is no scientific basis or link of breast cancer secondary to wearing bras. women on the east coast have the same predilection for breast cancer as those on the west coast or in the midwest. you may be comparing the breasts to testicular activity being affected by temperature but the breast does not work the same way nor is it affected by heat.
do bras cause breast cancer by not allowing natural cooling of the mammary glands?
never heard of this wives tale but it sounds exactly like one. not a chance.
do men get mammograms? how?
men can develop breast cancer and mammography would be part of the workup in a male with a breast lump.
do doctors put implants in women with family history of breast cancer if they want it?
not without the appropriate counseling of the pro's and con's. to wit: implants can interfere with the ability to perform the best test that we have for screening for breat cancer--mammograms. on the other hand 85-90% of all breast cancers occur due to environmental factors rather than heredity so many women have less of a family risk than they may realize.
do doctors put implants in women with family history of breast cancer if they want it?
women with a family history of breast cancer can certainly have breast augmentation surgery performed. however it is important that they understand the potential problems with imaging screening (mammography) that may be caused by the presence of breast implants. some decreased visualization of breast tissue is possible. best wishes.
do doctors put implants in women with family history of breast cancer if they want it?
breast implants can be placed in women with a family history of breast cancer.
do doctors put implants in women with family history of breast cancer if they want it?
breast occurs in 1 out if 8 women. of course family history is a very important risk factor. the placement if breast implant does make screening more difficult. it definitely is not something to be cavalier about from either the patient or surgeon perspective. even without a family history i have each augmentation patient in my practice have a mammogram that is normal prior to surgery.
do i need to do chemo for my breast cancer? i might want to do like g rancic.
whether or not you get chemo for breast cancer will depend on the stage of the cancer. if you have been diagnosed with cancer and are unsure of chemo talk to your oncologist. recommendations are based on clinical results of similar patients with similar staging.
do i need to do chemo for my breast cancer? i might want to do like g rancic.
breast cancer rx does not always include chemotherapy; this recommendation is made based upon a patient's cancer stage (tumor size status of lymph nodes) age and unique molecular features of the cancer. please seek out the opinion of a medical oncologist to decide whether chemotherapy is indicated for your cancer.
does breast cancer show up in blood tests?
apart from tests for genetic markers breast cancer is usually diagnosed from self exam or mammography where a mass is detected. if it persists throughout the cycle or is in postmenopausal women it should be aspirated. if the fluid is bloody or leaves a residual mass or the original mass is solid a mammogram and excisional biopsy are done.
does breast cancer show up in blood tests?
yes it does but you have to specifically order the correct tumor marker and not all breast cancers have elevated blood levels of tumor markers. this means that it is not a good way to monitor for breast cancer.
do i have to worry about breast cancer if i'm only 23?
dominique: breast cancer incidence increases the older a woman is and is very rare for women in their 20's. unless you have a strong family history i would not recommend any screening tests. however any palpable lump in the breast or new symptom (nipple discharge persistent pain skin change etc) should be evaluated by a physician.
do i have to worry about breast cancer if i'm only 23?
you dont have to worry about breast cancer unless you have a strong family history of cancers- esp with ovarian and breast cancers; or other kind cancers in more than 2-3 family members. if you do have a strong family history of ovarian and breast cancer you need to know whether any of the affected family members carries a brca 1/2 mutation. if yes discuss with md regarding your risk/prevention.
do i have to worry about breast cancer if i'm only 23?
worrying does no good. breast cancer at 23 is very rare. you should educate yourself about your family history and discuss it with your doctor. in general maintaing healthy weight exercise not using tobacco and alcohol are good preventive measure.
does wine increase or decrease breast cancer risk?
alcohol consumption increases breast cancer risk studies show consumption of 3 to 4 alcohol drinks a wk showed 15 % increase of breast cancer risk if you don't drink don't start.
does wine increase or decrease breast cancer risk?
the whole field of epidemiology based on people's recollections of their "bad habits" when faced (or not faced) with a deadly illness and with the likelihood of confounding variables generates huge amounts of often-contradictory claims about risks and benefits that are mostly moonshine. i'd urge you to ignore all the links that aren't obviously true (i. e. cigs and lung cancer).
does wine increase or decrease breast cancer risk?
if you are asking about it in males i will refer to some surgeons who are experts in cancer and male breast disorders. i also referred it to additional experts in case you were referring to adults in general. we will also try to provide some data references. thanks for asking!
do i have breast cancer on my left breast i formed this brown spot that has now became the size of a quater. about a week ago i notice that their is now a lump their problet the size of a pea that has become very tender.
time to see your doc.
do i have breast cancer on my left breast i formed this brown spot that has now became the size of a quater. about a week ago i notice that their is now a lump their problet the size of a pea that has become very tender.
hello. i dont know if you have cancer. most breast cancers aren't tender. cancers usually don't grow tremendously quickly. however it doesn't state how long the brown spot has been there. possibly the brown spot might be a mole. i don't know if you are fair skinned or have had very much sun exposure. please check the brown spot for the following. this information comes directly from the american academy of dermatology. asymmetry: if the mole has asymmetry (one half is unlike the other half). border: the border is irregular scalloped or poorly defined. color: the color is varied and has shades of tan brown or black; is sometimes white red or blue. diameter: the diameter is more than 6 mm (the size of a pencil eraser). evolving: a mole or skin lesion that looks different from the rest or is changing in size shape or color. if you have an irregular mole that itches bleed or is painful that can be worrisome for possible skin cancer. i do recommend that this be evaluated. normally breast tumors are evaluated by general surgeons and possible skin cancers are evaluated by dermatologists. because of the location i recommend that you see a general surgeon. take care.
how do you know the difference between a breast abscess and inflammatory breast cancer?
breast abscess is an infection that is presented with a thin walled area with pus accumulation- caused by bacteria. while on the other hand inflammatory breast cancer is a type of agressive breast cancer that involves the skin and soft tissue underneath- with clinical presentation that mimics inflammation process- swelling redness and pain
how do you know the difference between a breast abscess and inflammatory breast cancer?
confused so you must see a doctor to determine when a biopsy needs to be done. . cancer is not mistaken there.
how does a breast tumor look like in ultrasound?
breast cancers on us usually have the appearance of being deeper than wide are hypoechoic indicating they are solid and frequently have irregular borders. they are also not compressible.
had breast ultrasound for breast lump and dr said it was a cyst. its been there almost 3 months but getting smaller. could this be cancerous?
benign processes which develop when a duct becomes obstructed. with rare exception breast cancers grow solid; therefore if a breast lump is fluid-filled no further evaluation is needed. cysts require no rx although if it is painful or causing anxiety aspiration can resolve the cyst. if the ultrasound was definitive no follow-up is necessary; if equivocal a 6 month follow-up is advised.
have sore breast discoloured changed shape. took antibiotics nothing! i'm scared its inflammatory breast cancer. can an ultrasound detect this?
inflammatory cancer of the breast is a clinically and pathologically defined condition. mammo may show skin thickening or all sorts of different findings ultrasound may not add much. i can't say more based on your description but if you and your doc are concerned enough the way to go is a biopsy asap. hope it's not cancer but if it is fight well and best to you.
have sore breast discoloured changed shape. took antibiotics nothing! i'm scared its inflammatory breast cancer. can an ultrasound detect this?
i think that you should make an appointment to see a gynecologist or general surgeon this week. i would not wait. if you call and can't get in quickly find another doctor who will get you in quickly. i agree with you that since you had antibiotic treatment and there is no improvement that you do have cause for concern and appropriate tests should be run.
how much radiation is there in a digital mammogram? the clinic keeps telling me it's like a plane flight but i don't believe them.
they are correct. mammograms do result in an overall increased risk of developing breast cancer but the upside is you are more likely to diagnose and treat that breast cancer with the mammograms.
how common is breast cancer in male?
but it has worse prognosis than female breast cancer stage for stage.
how long will you. survive with triple negative breast cancer if untreated?
it is impossible to answer this question without knowing more particularly what stage the cancer is at. but don't find out. even triple negative cancer if caught at an early stage can be curable. surgery radiation and chemotherapy sound terrible and scary but are more tolerable than people think and we have become much better at managing side effects. talk with women who have been through it.
how long will you. survive with triple negative breast cancer if untreated?
triple negative breast cancer is the most aggressive breast cancer because it grows and spreads fast and there are fewer options for treatment. if no treatments are given the cancer will grow and spread and become incurable. theoretically if found when very small you could live for years but it would not be a good idea to find a small triple negative breast cancer and not treat it.
how dangerous would it be to stop taking tamoxifin for lcis as the side effects (hot flashes ) are just too much to take?
this question is best addressed by your oncologist who may be able to offer you some options to help deal with the side effects. the other way to answer this question is to ask yourself why you're taking tamoxifen? to prevent recurrence of breast cancer right? well that's the "danger" that you need to consider for yourself. another question to ask is quality of life vs quantity of life.
how to enlarge breast naturally or by which exercises it can be enlrge?
most of the breast is fat tissue so when one gains weight breast size tends to increase. another option to consider is an herb from thailand puereria mirifica which contains phytoestrogens and is widely promoted to increase breast size. there is some research showing it really does work and it also appears to reduce the risk of breast cancer! see <link> for more information.
how long does 18 infusions of herceptin (trastuzumab) cover you for breast cancer grade 3 her+3 stage 1?
in the us the studies of herceptin (trastuzumab) looked at a full year of treatment for patients with curable breast cancer. herceptin (trastuzumab) is given every three weeks for 17 doses. but why a year? it was chosen at random. in finland a similar study gave only 9 weeks of herceptin (trastuzumab). and patients did just as well! so after a year (or less) you are considered cured. you don't need more!
how long does 18 infusions of herceptin (trastuzumab) cover you for breast cancer grade 3 her+3 stage 1?
herceptin (trastuzumab) is a targeted therapy used to treat her-2 positive breast cancers. it is usually given together with 4 or 6 cycles of chemotherapy then continued every 3 weeks for a full year. the treatment reduces the likelihood of a recurrent cancer with the hope that the effect will be life-long.
hi. can tamoxifen have this side effects if uset by male for gyno water retention acne and weight gain?
tamoxifen has no serious side effects like you have described. it is very well tolerated drug in general. but who do you have to use it in the first instance? it is only useful for treating breast cancer both in females and in males who suffer from cancer.

it has spread to bones in those areas. please consult a doctor for more specific advice.
hi i want to ask which food have to take in 6. 5 uric acid i am breast cancer survivor. thanx?
tart cherry juice is effective; avoid organ meats; fatty meats and alcohol will elevate uric acid. avoid these. also drink at least 3 liters fluid per day - this may enhance uric acid excretion - and if you incline diet successfully to mostly whole grain fruit and veggies and nuts using white fish and egg white for protein then uric acid levels will come down.
hi i want to ask which food have to take in 6. 5 uric acid i am breast cancer survivor. thanx?
a serum uric acid of 6. 5 mg/dl is minimally elevated. ignore it. diet has virtually no benefit in lowering the uric acid level despite what other doctors may say.
hi i want to ask which food have to take in 6. 5 uric acid i am breast cancer survivor. thanx?
look up low purine diet. some seafood- lobster etc can precipitate gout as can some diuretic medications-hydrochlorthiazides.
how do i make my breasts larger naturally without breast implants?
what do you mean by natural? non-surgical? mechanical? weight gain? bio-identical hormones? garments? vacuum devices? duct tape? "chicken-cutlets"? pads? exercises? few of these provide sustained desirable results. hormones may stimulate early breast cancers. expanders may increase breast by vacuum. fat injections are another natural method. see <link>
how do i know if i have breast cancer rash?
the only way to know for sure is to be examined by a physician and if there is suspicion for cancer a biopsy of the skin would be performed. redness of the breast can be seen with infection or after radiation treatment in women who have been treated for breast cancer.
help! could squeezing the breast really hard cause breast cancer?
studies shows ( u k ) trauma ( injury ) as a the cause of cancer did not prove so the answer is no but causes moderate epithelial growth.

no it does not. hope this helps.
had ct scan to check for kidney stones and few weeks later had mri of lumbar spine. i am a woman in thirties. does this increase risk of breast cancer?
that amount of radiation will not increase risk of breast cancer it can affect the fetus if you are pregnant.
how frequently does a spot compression lead to a breast cancer diagnosis?
spot compression is used to determine if an area of abnormal appearing tissue on a mammogram spreads out like normal breast tissue or holds together densely like a more worrisome mass. usually it spreads out and you forget it. even when it leads to a biopsy because it doesn't compress it doesn't by any means absolutely mean cancer it just increases those chances.
how to know it is cyst or breast cancer?
who will take a history do a physical exam and possibly order tests such as mammogram or ultrasound.
had last a/c/t chemo for neoadjuvant breast cancer was told to make appt this month to measure toxicity from chemo. how is this done & what to expect?
medical oncologists often check blood counts (cbc) in the few months after chemotherapy to make sure they are recovering appropriately. women who had neoadjuvant chemo should also be seeing their breast surgeon to plan for surgery.
had last a/c/t chemo for neoadjuvant breast cancer was told to make appt this month to measure toxicity from chemo. how is this done & what to expect?
perhaps an echocardiogram has been requested. can you provide more information?
hysterectomy? should i remove the ovaries? i had triple positive breast cancer five years ago. or just have an oblation? i have three week period
are you asking because you are concerned about ovarian cancer risk or about reducing the risk of breast cancer recurrence? either way more info is needed (stage treatment family history etc. ). i suggest you talk to your oncologist and go over the risks of recurrence of the cancer you had risk of a second breast primary and risk of ovarian cancer. best to you.
hysterectomy? should i remove the ovaries? i had triple positive breast cancer five years ago. or just have an oblation? i have three week period
this can't be answered specifically in 400 characters with that amount of data. you should talk to a genetic counselor to carefully review breast cancer risk factors inclluding family history. it is also important to know what treatment you had (and may still be on) as well as menopausal status. (i'm confused that your profile says 46yo male).
how do you check breast cancer other than mammogram?
for diagnosis: physical examination ultrasound breast mri needle biopsy excisional biopsy for staging: pet/ct scan sentinnel lymph node biopsy lumpectomy mastectomy axillary node dissection for follow-up: usually physical examination and mammogram or mri.
how do you check breast cancer other than mammogram?
physical examination by your doctor and self exam augment the screening mammogram in most circumstances. there may be an emerging role for screening ultrasound in dense breasts. breast mri is also useful in particular cases.
how does harmony menopause work for someone who had breast cancer?
harmony menopause has not been shown to help with breast cancer. many herbal supplements can interfere with cancer screening and some can make cancer worse.
had anyone been cured from breast cancer using soursop leaves?
this is a vicious cynical scam. the plant (seeds are worst) is actually a neurotoxin. it is poisonous to some cancer cells in culture which is no surprise (just about anything can have an effect on stuff growing in a petri dish). there's not even an animal model and anyone who offers a human testimonial is lying -- it would have been published and a scientist's reputation made.
is it possible for breast cancer to cause bilateral axillary lymph nodes enlargement?
it would be very unlikely that breast ca would cause symmetrical and bilateral lymphnode swelling. sounds much more likely to be an infectious/viral process.
im 18 i have a small lump under my right armpit i think it enlarged a little since 3 4 weeks do i have breast cancer i get chills. too scared?
at 18 breast cancer very rare and would probably be palipable before spreading to axilla. lump may be sweat gland cyst or other non nodal problem. ff a node is enlarged it can come from lesion on chest wall as well as arm. gp should examine axilla to confirm finding of node and if questionable should be excised. fna produces too many errors in dx. chills unrelared.
im 18 i have a small lump under my right armpit i think it enlarged a little since 3 4 weeks do i have breast cancer i get chills. too scared?
it may be a cyst or an abscess. see your doctor for an assessment. breast cancer is very uncommon in someone of your age. all the best.
is breast cancer rare in a 23yo female?
but possible. so be checked. particularly if positive family history!
i had bilateral breast cancer and ct with rt. now ct scan showed atelectasis or infiltration in the right middle and left lingula. er doc said it's ok?
there are a number of reasons for atelectasis (collapse alveoli or air sacs) or infiltration (areas of inflammation) in the lung: infection mucus plugging or shallow breathing. though the cause is most likely unrelated to your cancer lung cancers or recurrent breast may sometimes appear as infiltration. best thing to do is to schedule a follow-up visit with your oncologist for evaluation.
is it possible to go 6 years without knowing you have breast cancer?
at 24 yrs of age a malignant lesion usually presents with a nodular mass and over a several yr. period of time the mass would have grown significantly in size to be easily identified if not associated with metastasis. most lesions at your age are hormone dependent and grow rapidly with estrogen stimulation. mammograms cant be performed due to density of tissue and sensitivity to rt. from mammo.
is it possible to go 6 years without knowing you have breast cancer?
cancers grow at different rates. some cancer can be around for many years before you develop symptoms.
is it possible to go 6 years without knowing you have breast cancer?
many breast cancers are diagnosed months or years after they start. ideally the sooner they are diagnosed the better the outcome of treatment. after diagnosis of breast cancer is made it is very difficult to know exactly when it started. regular clinical exams mammography as recommended by your healthcare provider as well as breast self examination would make early detection more likely.
is it possible to go 6 years without knowing you have breast cancer?
not sure whether you are worried about it or have actually had a diagnosis. tumors less than a millimeter in size will not be seen on a mammogram nor felt during examination. some tumors are so slow growing that they can grow for years before detection. if you have large breasts special imaging must be used to detect small lesions. hope that helps. message me if you have additional concerns.

recommendations on gene mutations are best given by a medical geneticist who needs a detailed understanding of the exact test that you had done and the detailed results. many gene mutations cause a loss of function so you don't necessarily want to turn off the mutated gene. modern genetics is discovering many genetic markers that convey only small risk of disease and may require no treatment.
i was told i have fibrocystic lumpy breasts 10 years ago but my doctor has never done any imaging. is this normal?
imaging is not very good in dense breasts. fibrocystic change is very common. a change or a single suspicious area would be an indication for imaging but routine screening is recommended to begin at age 40 in those at normal risk. this would be earlier if you had a mother or sister with breast cancer in which you would begin screening 5 years earlier than the age at which she was diagnosed.

your family history symptoms and size of ovarian cyst are worrisome. you need surgery to remove it. if your ob/gyn is worried about cancer he/she may recommend that your surgery be done by a gyn oncologist (a specialist in female cancers) but this isn't always necessary. ob/gyns are trained to make this decision. best wishes.
i'm 30 years old have never had children. my mam had breast cancer when she was 44 i've got 27cm septated cyst in ovary & have typical ov/ca symptoms?
that big a cyst (bigger than a baseball if that's the right measurement) is going to produce mass effect and this doesn't have any bearing on malignancy. an imaging specialist can advise you on whether this probably mucinous cystadenoma needs to come out and you're welcome to get several opinions. you may be offered a brca1 & 2 test & given more options. glad you're educating yourself. cheers.

metastatic breast cancer spreading to lymph nodes? is that usually pretty bad?
lymph nodes are one aspect of evaluation for stage and treatment of breast cancer. it depends on size of breast cancer itself number of lymph nodes involved hormone status of the tumor and dna testing can also help identify breast cancer risks. if the lymph node involvement is small then there is little additioanl risk to the patient. there are many factors involved in assessing breast cancer.
metastatic breast cancer spreading to lymph nodes? is that usually pretty bad?
the good news is that we treat breast cancer including metastatic disease very well. spread to the lymph nodes means that it has left the breast and there is potential for spread to other areas of the body. prognosis depends on how many lymph nodes are involved size of the tumor hormone status of the tumor. it is important to complete your prescribed treatment.

my mother died from breast cancer and now her sister has it. im takin hrt but hear it promotes some cancers. am i a high risk and is hrt increasing the risk?
just the fact that your mother had breast cancer puts you at risk. hrt could potentially increase that risk. hope this helps.
my mother died from breast cancer and now her sister has it. im takin hrt but hear it promotes some cancers. am i a high risk and is hrt increasing the risk?
first yes by family history you have a statistically higher risk of breast cancer with two first degree relatives affected by the condition. second yes some hormone replacement medications also can increase your risks of breast cancer. see your doctor who prescribed you the medication to review your risks. consider genetic testing for brca gene. be sure to have yearly physical exam & mammograms.
my wife had a growth in her breast when she was a teenager it was removed. what's the chance she can have a breast cancer pls?
most likely she had fibroadenoma a benign tumor was removed. if she has no genetic mutations like braca i & ii her 2 or family history nothing to worry. she has same chance as any woman she needs regular self examinations check ups by her doctor and mammography every year and don't worry.
my wife had a growth in her breast when she was a teenager it was removed. what's the chance she can have a breast cancer pls?
chances are that your wife had a fibroadenoma removed the most common benign breast tumor. this shouldn't increase her risk of breast cancer. if she does not have any family risks she's no different than any other woman. therefore she should begin yearly mammography at age 40 and see her doctor for yearly breast examination.

if you are 18 years old that is a very early age to be considering mastectomy surgery. it would be best to see your family doctor and get a referral to a genetic counselor for consideration of brca testing to see what your risks are. you may or may not have a higher risk of breast and/or ovarian cancers. be checked first before considering the worst.
my bio mother had breast cancer at a young age and my bio grandmother had ovarian cancer. both passed from it. prophylactic mastectomy an option?
you should see a genetic counselor to assess your risk and to determine if genetic testing is appropriate for you.
my bio mother had breast cancer at a young age and my bio grandmother had ovarian cancer. both passed from it. prophylactic mastectomy an option?
brca 1 and 2 are genetic mutations that can be passed through families and those affected have a higher than average risk of developing those kinds of cancers. would recommend appointment with a genetic counselor and consider getting that test done. if positive then you and your doctor can make a plan for higher intensity monitoring or prophylactic surgery.
my 79 year old friend has breast cancer since 2004. is she at the end now? she fefused all treaments. and not eating! living on vitimin water.
if your friend has disease that has spread extensively then the fact that she is not eating may reflect end of life. however she should be evaluated for other problems that maybe treatable such as depression even if her disease is advanced. when someone with cancer becomes bedbound and stops eating generally the life expectancy is less then 3 months and less then 2 weeks if not hydrating.
my 79 year old friend has breast cancer since 2004. is she at the end now? she fefused all treaments. and not eating! living on vitimin water.

my mother had 5 years ago of breast cancer but now good health but this time the doctor found that the analysis of (cea) has increased by 13. 6 why?
i wonder why it was ordered to begin with. was it routine or was she having some symptoms? the problem with markers is that once found high (and confirmed high) we are almost obligated to work it up with additional tests. best wishes to both hope it is nothing serious.
my mother had 5 years ago of breast cancer but now good health but this time the doctor found that the analysis of (cea) has increased by 13. 6 why?
have been ordered unless it was measured at the outset and was high at diagnosis. this exemplifies the use of an unproven test that will lead to expensive probing that may or may not find something work knowing meaning needing treatment that results in benefit.
my mother had 5 years ago of breast cancer but now good health but this time the doctor found that the analysis of (cea) has increased by 13. 6 why?
that is why markers are not the greatest. now she is going to need to get scans. cea is better for colon cancer but can be elevated in other cancers. however tumor markers should not be used in early stage breast cancer.
my left breast is sore im 22 not pregnant not on period not on borth control my grandmother died of breast cancer at 60 how do i check for it/what could be wrong?
breast pain may be a sign of cancer however breast pain is far more commonly due to benign processes. cyclic changes in hormone levels are a common cause of breast pain. if this persists beyond a few cycles i suggest you see your gyne for a breast exam. having a 60 yr old g'mother w/breast cancer should not change your risks & at age 20 your chance of cancer is 1in a million.
my left breast is sore im 22 not pregnant not on period not on borth control my grandmother died of breast cancer at 60 how do i check for it/what could be wrong?
statistically it is unlikely you have cancer but you need to see your doc for a proper examination.

there are no holistic approaches to treating breast cancer. sometimes a simple medicine (tamoxifen) is used instead of standard treatment if the patient is very old has alzheimer's etc. but surgery is well tolerated and the standard for most breast cancers. there are holistic approaches that can deal with side effects depression tiredness aches and pains etc but they are not curative.
my mom is suffered from breast cancer she is 52 years old and surgery is done i want to know what is mean by er pr negative and her3+positive.?
the estrogen- progesterone- and her2/neu receptors are proteins present on some women's breast cancer cells. their presence/absence along with the anatomic stage (tumor size lymph node involvement) guide chemotherapy recommendations including which drugs may be most effective. unless your mother's tumor is very small it is likely her oncologist will recommend chemorx including herceptin (trastuzumab).
my mom is suffered from breast cancer she is 52 years old and surgery is done i want to know what is mean by er pr negative and her3+positive.?
some breast cancers display receptors to the hormones estrogen and progesterone. if the cancers have these hormone receptors certain drugs can be used to slow down their grow. er/pr negative means that your mother's tumors do not display these receptors. her2neu is a different target for a type of chemo. your mother's breast cancer is positive and may benefit from treatment. speak with her docs.
my mother has metastasis breast cancer along with ulcerated growth in the breasts. what is the survival rate?
i am sorry to hear about your mother's diagnosis. this is hard to answer without knowing the specific biology of your mom's cancer and which organs are involved. nowadays we consider stage iv breast ca like a chronic illness; one we cannot cure but we can often manage and control. if your mother consents it would be best to pose this question to her cancer doctors.
my mother has metastasis breast cancer along with ulcerated growth in the breasts. what is the survival rate?
stage 4 breast cancer with ulcerating lesions can respond to chemotherapy with tumor shrinkage or maybe healing of the ulcers. some patients can live many years with good response to treatment and others will not respond as well. ask the oncologist who will have much better information specifically for your mother's condition.
my grandma had breast cancer will gp do a breast exam because of my family history?
breast exam is part of a general physical exam or for symptoms or new history. would not expect a breast exam if went for sinus infection. if you are seeing gp for a specific reason like a sinus infection and want to have a breast exam performed given new family history anxiety re: risk change in self exam etc. then breast exam could be doneas well.
my grandma had breast cancer will gp do a breast exam because of my family history?
your family doctor is a good place to sart. you should practice breast self examination(bse) and have your docotor do the annual clinical breast examination(cbe). he will likely advise you to do regular mammograms as a screening method for early detection of breast cancer.

breast cancer may recur locally (in breast after lumpectomy) or systemically (distant organs=metastasis). if the former mastectomy is recommended; if the latter chemotherapy. the "why" part is a lot harder to answer relating to the unique type of cancer she had and its original rx. i suggest you accompany your mother to her oncology appointments for support & a better understanding of the "why".
my mother is 80 years old. in 2008 she was diagnosed with breast cancer. she received treatment but it has reappeared again. what caused it to reappear again?
depends on the type & stage of the first breast cancer & the treatments received (chemotherapy & radiation therapy). depends on where it has reappeared: skin chest wall bone lung lymph node etc. breast cancers can recur and close exams & follow up after the first treatments are important. an oncologist will help direct the correct care & treatment options.
my friend is diagnosed with breast cancer & went for surgery. is now under chemotherapy. can she take graviola tree products alongside? side effects?

" so that you can be around for high school graduation ceremonies for both of those children.
had 2 babies over 40. is that considered high risk for breast cancer? breastfeed both. how much higher of a risk than average woman.
we don't truly understand what "causes" breast cancer outside certain mutations (brca1/2) ; in most cases its a combination of factors - gene switches ; lifetime experiences. many items associated w/ "risk" have been identified such as early menarche late 1st period mammo density. these are not causes but likely surrogates for other influencing factors. #1 risk: being female and having breast.
heard that after giving birth you're risk of breast cancer goes up in the following 10 years. is this true and is it very high risk?
it is true that risk of breast cancer goes up minimally after childbirth but having children and especially breast feeding protect against breast cancer. see this site for more information on risks for breast cancer. <link> cancer. org/cancer/breastcancer/detailedguide/breast-cancer-risk-factors.
heard that after giving birth you're risk of breast cancer goes up in the following 10 years. is this true and is it very high risk?
there are factors which can influence breast cancers both ways. some factors can decrease the risk (e. g early age first term pregnancy) and others can increase the risk (e. g later age at first pregnancy). breast feeding age of your first period and more seem to have an effect. we don't know all the influences. we are learning. sometimes i get the feeling the more we learn the less we know.
have studies shown conclusively that the radiation from a lifetime of mammograms does not cause breast cancer? which studies are they?
that type of study would be impossible to perform. radiation induced cancer risks are extrapolated from various data sources but not controlled studies. the theoretical slight cancer risk of mammography is dwarfed by the number of cancers mammography detects. you can easily calculate the risks using an interactive tool at xrayrisk. com
have studies shown conclusively that the radiation from a lifetime of mammograms does not cause breast cancer? which studies are they?
the question is whether finding cancers earlier justifies the expense inconvenience the trouble and cost of false-positive readings and perhaps increased cancer risk. there are some good reads bmj. 345:e5660 2012 suggested for women with brca1/brca2 mutations early mammographs much increase total risk; health physics. 101(5):578-82 2011 nov. felt risk is minimal if started in older women.

how long can exemestane work for stage 4 breast cancer? i've been on it 6 months and i have no more active cancer. i'm terrified it will come back.
that varies. i have had patients on their first hormone treatment for over 5-10 years. ultimately if it is stage 4 the cancer will recur. regular follow ups and exams are very important. hope this helps.
how long can exemestane work for stage 4 breast cancer? i've been on it 6 months and i have no more active cancer. i'm terrified it will come back.
exemestane is a good drug. it can keep working for long periods of time. so you do not need to worry about how long it will work. sometime sit can work for many years especially if you have no visible cancer now. which means your cancer is in remission. such patients generally do very well on hormonal therapies. good luck.
her2-positive breast cancer stage 1 level 3 and 70 yrs old - how much longer can somebody expect to live?
stage 1 cancer is curable with appropriate treatment. with surgery to remove the tumor and appropriate chemotherapy including herceptin (trastuzumab) the chance of cure is very high. in someone age 70 the doses of chemo drugs might need to be reduced but herceptin (trastuzumab) is not chemo. older people do well on it! it is very unlikely she will die from breast cancer if she gets good treatment now.

i have been having twinges in my left breast. have had mammo ultrasound & mri. all normal. breast tissue dense. concerned about breast cancer. what followup do you recommend? tests were done last august.
first it is great news that all of the testing has been normal to this point. i know it is frustrating not having an answer about the cause of the twinges. i would imagine repeating the mammogram in 3-6 months would be reasonable. if there is an early breast cancer (which there doesn't seem to be) you would be catching it early when it's very treatable. would need more info about twinges.

i take spironolactone 100 mg daily for pcos. is it safe for me long term if i used to have fibroids and my mom has fibrocystic breasts but no cancer?
to my knowledge spironolactone has no effect on the risk of getting breast cancer. none of your stated conditions does either.
is it safe for me having a family history of breast cancer to use hormonal contraceptive if no what's the best way to be safe and don't case problems?
if you have a very strong history of breast cancer and/or have been found to be positive for the "breast cancer gene " you may choose to use non-hormonal contraception - like the paraguard iud for example. there are also very low dose progesterone-only pills that may be reasonable choices also. it's all a matter of risk vs. benefits. talk to your doctor. lgromkomd
i was recently diagnosed with. 6 cm cancerous breast tumor. i have chosen to have a double mastectomy. will i have to take arimidex (anastrozole).
the decision of how to treat breast cancer is highly personal and individual. the choice of double mastectomy will allow for a more symmetric outcome should you choose to remain without reconstruction or choose to reconstruct. also mastectomy obviates the need for radiation another plus. 5 years of an estrogen-blocker such as tamoxifen or arimidex (anastrozole) is standard depending on tumor receptor status.
is. 6 cm maglinant breast cancer considered small? easily treatable?
a 0. 6 cm tumor usually has a very good prognosis once excised but there are no certainties. i am very glad you found it early. best wishes.
is. 6 cm maglinant breast cancer considered small? easily treatable?
in general yes it is if there is no metastases to the regional lymph nodes so the bottom line depen (penicillamine) on the staging from 1-5. and the treatment for the original cancer will dictate the need for other treatment like chemotherapy and radiation therapy. the lower the stage the higher chance of survival.
is tamoxifen essential in invasive ductal carcinoma (hr+/er+)? does additional chemotherapy is neccesary in stage 1 cancer?
yes anti-estrogen therapy is essential for er+/pr+ invasive ductal carcinoma. while tamoxifen is used in premenopausal women femara (letrozole) or arimidex used in postmenopausal women. some stage i breast cancers (er+/pr+) do not require further chemotherapy others do. the need for additional chemotherapy can be assessed by tumor size recurrence score from a special molecular testing and etc.

i had a mammography yesterday because of a lump in my breast and it was nothing. is a one time mammography dangerous or increase cancer risk? im 25
two reasons for not doing a mammogram under 35 is that young breast tissue is very dense and mammo frequently unable to visualize a lesion the other reason is that breast tissue under 35 is very sensitive to x ray and repeated films in a young patient can increase incidence of breast cancer. under 35 one uses good palpation and sonography. if necessary in rare cases an mri can be performed.

i'm 17 and i have small breasts. does this mean i'll get breast cancer sooner?
there is no such association for developing breast cancer. you need to read up(google it) about causes of breast cancer and you will learn that excess of female hormone(estrogens)may have some such bearing. but you do not have any such problem.
i'm 17 and i have small breasts. does this mean i'll get breast cancer sooner?
one might speculate that having more breast tissue allows a greater potential for some area of breast to transform to malignancy and the smaller the amt of tissue the less the chance. this would apply to males with smaller breasts having a lower incidence of breast ca however it is exposure to the carcinogenic effects derived from the environment that correlates with ca development
i have some pain on the lower left side of my left breast for the past 4 years. 3 years ago i took a mammogram and there were no findings. is it tumor?
for the most part breast pain is not a hallmark of breast cancer. the inability to note a lump in the area of pain with a negative mammogram further reinforces the pain process as benign. in addition the presence of t he pain symptoms for 4 yrs without progression of the degree of pain further suggests stability of the process which for the most part is related to fibrocystic disease.
i have a small bump on my areola. it has been there for about a month. it has gotten bigger over time. my mom had breast cancer could i have it too?
most lesion of breast origin occur in the parenchyma of the breast itself and appear first on mammo and then as a small palpable lesion. the rarer form of pagets disease begins in the terminal ducts which ends in the formation of the nipple. rare for malignancies to appear as a small areola lesion. if it persists or enlarges bx should be performed.
i might have to take tamoxifen (invasive ductal carcinoma-waiting for hormone tests to come back). wouldn't a hysterectomy accomplish the same thing with fewer side effects?
the purpose of taking tamoxifen post resection of invasive breast cancer is to minimize the effect of the bodys estrogen on possible growth factor receptors such as estrogen receptor on. br ca performing a bso alone or in combination with hysterectomy minimizes levels of estrogen in the host. it also minimizes the effect tamoxifen has acting as an estrogen on the uterus to induce endometrial ca
my grandma was diagnosed with breast cancer that has spread to 2 lymph nodes. what stage is that?

quit smoking.
my throat hurts i smoke one cigarette per day i had breast cancer/surgery radiation/chemo in 2009?
all patients with a history of cancer need routine follow up to ensure recurrence has not developed. however your sore throat could be as simple as strep throat. tobacco puts you at higher risk for head and neck cancers (also many other cancers) so everybody should be encouraged to stop. consult with your primary care doctor to start with a great history and physical.
my throat hurts i smoke one cigarette per day i had breast cancer/surgery radiation/chemo in 2009?
is this a persistent sore throat? if so i would see your friendly ent for an exam.

my mom was diagnosis with tubulo-lobular breast cancer nottingham score grade 2. tubule formation was graded 3 with very little tubules. how can this be.?
if the tumor is mostly lobular with very little tubule formation it would be graded 3 in terms of tubule formation. the overall grade would still be 2 since the nuclei are usually small sized and the mitotic rate low. these tumors usually have a good prognosis if they are under 2cm and a single focus.
my mom was diagnosis with tubulo-lobular breast cancer nottingham score grade 2. tubule formation was graded 3 with very little tubules. how can this be.?
tubular breast cancer or lobular breast cancer or tubulolobular that's a combination have excellent prognosis. usually they are endocrine responsive and in majority of them chemotherapy can be avoided. pathological description can be confusing but bottom line is they have very good prognosis after proper surgery and completion of adjuvant therapy.
my mom has breast cancer and is having surgery. how serious is it if she must have surgery?
breat cancer is one of the cancers for which we have good treatments and upwards of 80% cure rate. yet it is difficult to predict how one patient will do as we must monitor them for several years before we can be sure that a person is trouble free. having surgery does not neceassarily mean that it is bad as surgery is only done if it is relatively early cancer.
my mom has breast cancer and is having surgery. how serious is it if she must have surgery?
wind up having surgery if they are at all suspicious. the surgery itself is not serious. it is the implications of what the surgery finds (nodes margins size receptors) that provide information on seriousness and need for/ option for further treatment.
mother had lobular breast ca at 54. i'm 27 had an breast ultrasound which came back normal but radiologist said they can't see lobular on u/s? is this true? am i at increased risk for lobular ca?
you are at an increased risk for breast cancer which may be lobular or other types of breast ca due to your family history. lobular cancers may be harder to be identified on mammogram as well as ultrasound. but if your ultrasound was negative do not imply that you may have lobular cancer. stay proactive in your breast care with regular self exams clinical breast exam and breast imaging as needed.
mother had lobular breast ca at 54. i'm 27 had an breast ultrasound which came back normal but radiologist said they can't see lobular on u/s? is this true? am i at increased risk for lobular ca?
you are at increased risk for any type of breast cancer. try this risk assessment tool <link> then speak to your doctor about your choices of early screening such as abus mri and beginning mammogram before age 40y.
mother had lobular breast ca at 54. i'm 27 had an breast ultrasound which came back normal but radiologist said they can't see lobular on u/s? is this true? am i at increased risk for lobular ca?
lobular breast cancer can sometimes be missed on mammograms but the new digital mammograms have a higher diagnostic yield. mri breast can be useful in someone who have lobular cancer and initially missed on mammogram or us. it is also indicated for brca positive cancers and for women with dense breasts. i don't think that you are at increased risk for lobular cancer.
my daughter had a lumpectomy last feb. removing about 1/4 of her breast tissue. now her breast has filled in and looks like the other. is this normal?
if a lumpectomy was done for a fibroadenoma this kind of tumor usually squishes the normal breast tissue out of the way. once the fibroadenoma is gone the normal breast tissue fills in the space. if the lumpectomy was done for another reason (biopsy or for breast cancer for example) then the lumpectomy cavity will often fill up with clear serious fluid which is normal--nature's implant.
mother diagnosis with breast cancer at 54 maternal grandmother diagnosis with pancreatic ca at 69. dr's won't do brca test because there is no other breast/ovarian ca in my family. what do i do? i'm so worried.

mother diagnosis with breast cancer at 54 maternal grandmother diagnosis with pancreatic ca at 69. dr's won't do brca test because there is no other breast/ovarian ca in my family. what do i do? i'm so worried.
you are at higher risk for breast cancer because your mother has had breast cancer. you should consult your health care provider and come up with a screening plan for breast cancer surveillance. other than breast self examination nothing likely needs to be done before you are at least 30 years old.
mother diagnosis with breast cancer at 54 maternal grandmother diagnosis with pancreatic ca at 69. dr's won't do brca test because there is no other breast/ovarian ca in my family. what do i do? i'm so worried.
independant. about 5% of breast cancer comes from a famiaial inherited gene and the radar goes off for this when 1st degree relative dx'd prior to age 50. most likey you do not carry this gene but we use whats called the gail model (look this up) to determine who should be screened. approx 9% of women will get a breast cancer diagnosis most are not related to a brca 1 or 2 gene.

my breast cancer was painful at the lump site. do i need to be concerned?
if you have already had a lumpectomy pain at the biopsy site is not uncommon and is usually related to focal scarring or a residual seroma (a pocket of fluid that fills the lumpectomy site. ).
my breast cancer was painful at the lump site. do i need to be concerned?
yes the breast cancer needs to be promptly and properly diagnosed staged and treated. no the presence of pain does not alter the work up treatment or prognosis- so no need for added concern.
mother had breast cancer in stage 3 8 years agoand now has a secondary bone cancer said dr. it at an early stage and take the risk and give them only?
has findings in bones compatible with recurrent breast cancer 8 years later. i would not call this an ealy stage. with long interval best to biopsy check er/pr/her-2-neu on the biopsy to guide therapy. if painful or weight bearing single fraction xrt or cryotherapy.

my mom was recently diagnosed with breast cancer (age 60). does that increase my sister's risk of getting breast cancer?
having a family history of breast cancer does increase your risk.
my mom was recently diagnosed with breast cancer (age 60). does that increase my sister's risk of getting breast cancer?
about 80% of women who get breast cancer don't have anyone in their family with breast cancer but if you have a first degree relative with breast cancer ie mother sister or even father or brother then that increases your risk of breast cancer.
my mom was recently diagnosed with breast cancer (age 60). does that increase my sister's risk of getting breast cancer?
has at least one first degree relative (your mom). are there others in the family aunts and yes uncles? one case does not establish a pattern of risk. genetic testing is available at a price nd not always covered by insurance.
my two anties have breast cancer what are the risk of me getting it ?
i do not know if you are a male as the origin of the question indicates. male breast cancer is very rare and you would not likely inherit risks from your aunts. if you are asking about a female breast cancer risk the risks are probably not greatly increased over the standard 12-14% lifetime risk as your aunts are not first degree relatives. females can be tested for brca risk too.
my two anties have breast cancer what are the risk of me getting it ?
anyone in your family have ovarian cancer? did your aunts develop breast cancer before menopause. plus in general men have a low risk of developing breast cancer.
my mom had breast cancer i'm 39 and i just had a mammogram and breast ultrasound and got called back to my doctor should i be worried?
you had a screening mammogram. this test is designed to determine if your mammogram is normal or abnormal. an abnormal mammogram does not mean you have breast cancer. you can have a fibroadenoma a breast cyst or other benign breast condition which are much more common than breast cancer. the next step if the screening mammogram is abnormal is to perform a diagnostic mammogram of the area.
my mom had breast cancer i'm 39 and i just had a mammogram and breast ultrasound and got called back to my doctor should i be worried?
regardless of your family history it sounds like your doctor simply wants to discuss the results of your tests with you. while this may mean the radiologist saw something on one or both of your tests it does not necessarily mean it is something bad. it is understandably nerve-wracking to have to wait. express your anxiety and ask to see the doctor sooner to ease your mind.
my mom had breast cancer i'm 39 and i just had a mammogram and breast ultrasound and got called back to my doctor should i be worried?
sorry your mom had breast cancer unless several members of her family like your aunts your sisters has then you have to worry and need to test braca i and ii genes other wise it is incidental not familial like any woman need to follow with your doctor for breast exams mammography etc your doctor will call you and give findings good luck.
my mom had breast cancer i'm 39 and i just had a mammogram and breast ultrasound and got called back to my doctor should i be worried?
called back to the radiologist for extra views or called to your physician to discuss results? if the former this happens about 10% of the time and 80% of the time it turns out to be nothing of concern.
my mom had breast cancer i'm 39 and i just had a mammogram and breast ultrasound and got called back to my doctor should i be worried?
in addition to dr. jackson's response you may want to got to get a risk assessment. since your mom was so young when diagnosed she should get a brca test. you would also qualify for testing if your mother is not available to be tested. a breast center or breast surgeon can provide assessment.
my mother had breast cancer age 43 but their is no familial deaseas so why did it happen to her and is it possible that i get this disease later on?
the vast majority of women who get breast cancer do not have family history of breast cancer. you mother should have undergone testing for the breast cancer genes brca1 and brca2. this would also help to determine your risk of breast cancer.
my mother had breast cancer age 43 but their is no familial deaseas so why did it happen to her and is it possible that i get this disease later on?
only about 10-15% of breast cancers are related to hereditary risks. that means 85% of breast cancers occur spontaneously with no known family risk. and women in the us have a 12-14% lifetime risk of getting breast cancer. as you have a first degree relative with breast cancer have yearly physical exams after age 20 yearly mammogram after age 40 & consider genetic testing for yourself.

my father died from multiple myeloma at age 57 and my mother died from breast cancer at age 54 am i at risk too?
you are at risk for breast cancer but less likely myeloma cannot say no risk.
my father died from multiple myeloma at age 57 and my mother died from breast cancer at age 54 am i at risk too?
there is no clear inheritance pattern in multiple myeloma. second of all majority of breast cancer is sporadic in nature and only 15 % or so cases are familial. are there other family members either in your father and/or mother sides who also were diagnosed of having cancers? if there are- consider to see a genetician to calculate your risk and to update your screening test.
my mother has stage 3 breast cancer. could she still battle it?
although it can be a difficult treatment with a combination of surgery chemotherapy and possibly radiation most of these treatments are aimed at getting rid of the cancer and preventing it from coming back. unless she has many other or more serious health concerns that make it unlikely for her to live another year or two then some form of treatment is a good idea.
my mother has stage 3 breast cancer. could she still battle it?

my grandma has metastatic breast cancer in her ribs & spine she keeps getting these hot flushes. causes?
ask her medical oncologist. some of the treatments she is getting could cause those symptoms. is she having fevers? the medical oncoligist would likely want her to watch for signs of fever infections or check for low white blood cell count (neutropenia).
my grandma has metastatic breast cancer in her ribs & spine she keeps getting these hot flushes. causes?
if her breast cancer type was sensitive to estrogen and/or progesterone the her oncologist likely is treating with antihormonal therapy. this is in the form of a pill taken daily. by blocking the receptors or creation of these hormones you effectively cause symptoms similar to what occurs during menopause when the ovaries greatly decrease their production of estrogen and progesterones.
my mom has stage 2 breast cancer and i'm extremely depressed. how can i deal with this?
go to one of her oncology appointments to listen to her doctor & get more information. results from current treatments can be highly successful. learn more & be informed. be upbeat around her & help her when you can even with small things. she may need your support. and have a yearly physical examination yourself.

my mother has stage 4 rare breast cancer just got double mastectomy i've read about the incredible benefits of coq10 input?
coq10 benefits for treating cancer are low. the data and research have been with chemotherapy or hormone therapy based on the hormone receptor status of the tumor. using coq10 with chemotherapy not a lot of data. this should be discussed with her oncologist. hope this helps.
my mother has stage 4 rare breast cancer just got double mastectomy i've read about the incredible benefits of coq10 input?
this is in fact what "incredible" means. there are a few papers in junk journals alleging some relief from the side-effects of chemotherapy. these have been parleyed by the people who want to sell you coenzyme q into false hope for cancer itself praying on desperation and the natural tendency to think "what if this did work? " don't reward these people.
my mother has stage 4 rare breast cancer just got double mastectomy i've read about the incredible benefits of coq10 input?

the answer to this depends mainly on the type of surgery you have had. if you had a mastectomy you would not require radiation. if you had a lumpectomy you probably would benefit from radiation.
do i need radiation therapy if i have early stage breast cancer with clear margins?
the stage is important but so are other things. namely the type of carcinoma (ductal vs lobular) invasive disease vs in situ (or both) differentiation status receptor expression etc. if low grade neg margins & neg nodes skipping radiation is likely an option. if your oncologist insists ask why and get yourself a second opinion (including pathology review) for assurance.
do i need radiation therapy if i have early stage breast cancer with clear margins?
discuss at length with your doc. if you are really 32 you have a much higher risk of recurrence in the breast than a much older woman (assuming that you had lumpectomy). radiation or mastectomy is definitely indicated. lumpectomy alone may be ok in very selected post-menopausal tumors that are estrogen receptor positive good margins small and with specific pathologic features.
describe to me what ductal carcinoma cancer is?
ductal carcinoma in-situ is the earliest stage of a breast cancer. it is also referred to as dcis or non-invasive breast cancer. dcis is when the cancer cells are growing within the breast ducts. at this stage it is usually not palpable on physical examination. it is usually discovered where there are abnormal microcalcifications seen on a mammogram.

mum had a breast cancer;she did a mastectomy. she had 1/12 affected node she wants to do a breast reconstruction what do you think about that
1/12 nodes considering the tumor was rather small means that she will likely need chemo but hopefully not radiation. in either way she would be a great candidate for breast reconstruction. the radiations makes it more difficult but still a great option when it comes to restoring the body to its normal state.

a doctor that you can see yearly for physical exams. perform breast self exams. yearly mammograms at age 40. can ask your doctor about brca and have genetic testing. be healthy. eat healthy. maintain a healthy weight. exercise.
my relative has metastatic breast cancer going through the final stages. is it advisable for her daughter to undergo tests? is cancer hereditary?
breast cancer are hereditary. it's best to ask your relative's doctor what if she had the genetic type of breast cancer. if your relative got it at a fairly young age it is definitely advisable for her daughter to get genetic testing.
my relative has metastatic breast cancer going through the final stages. is it advisable for her daughter to undergo tests? is cancer hereditary?
as many as 10-15% of breast cancers in the us are believed to be hereditary. these are linked to mutations of a particular group of genes called the brca genes. there is a simple blood test to check to see if someone has a brca mutation. if your relative was diagnosed at an early age and/or there are other family members w/breast or ovarian cancer it may be appropriate for your relative.
my ultrasound shows multiple ovoid lesions in both breasts features may present fibrodenomas. does it increase future risk of breast cancer?
simple fibroadenomas do not increase risk of breast cancer. however some fibroadenomas are complex and do have a small increased lifetime risk for cancer. the practical issue is how many how large and how many to biopsy/sample and how to follow up if they are not removed. go see a surgical onoclogist or general surgeon with experience and special interest/expertise on breast disease
my ultrasound shows multiple ovoid lesions in both breasts features may present fibrodenomas. does it increase future risk of breast cancer?
does not pre-dispose to cancer.
my mum diagnosed with breast cancer stage 2 doctor recommended. surgery to remove whole breast completely. is it possible for her to complete cured?
stage 2 breast cancer are larger and/or have spread to nearby lymph nodes. many treatments may help. the five-year survival rate for women with stage ii cancer is estimated to be about 74% - 81% or higher. being curable is difficult to say but the longer the survival rate the better the chance.
my mum diagnosed with breast cancer stage 2 doctor recommended. surgery to remove whole breast completely. is it possible for her to complete cured?
until her surgery is complete and her lymph nodes and breast tissue are examined you will not know her true stage of disease. please be patient and make sure she has seen a plastic surgeon if she has had a mastectomy. it is her right to have the best reconstruction possible.
might somebody have breast cancer if he had the same symptom for 1 year?
what are the symptoms? if you are concerned see your doctor.
my mother was diagnosed with breast cancer at 54 grandmother had pancreatic cancer at 70 and great aunt had colon cancer at 65. no one else has cancer in my large family. could i have the brca gene?
the risk of having a brca mutation can be estimated at: <link> myriadpro. com/brca-risk-calculator/calc. html. a woman with ashkenazi jewish heritage and this family history would have about an 8% chance of having a brca mutation. without ashkenazi heritage the risk drops to 1. 5%. the best way to know for sure would be to have your mother see a genetic counselor and consider having testing.
my mother was diagnosed with breast cancer at 54 grandmother had pancreatic cancer at 70 and great aunt had colon cancer at 65. no one else has cancer in my large family. could i have the brca gene?
if your mother's cancer was "triple negative" and if she's still alive (which i truly hope) she fulfills criteria for testing. recently pancreatic cancer was added to the criteria so if she can't or won't test you should discuss this with your doc. best to you.
my mother was diagnosed with breast cancer at 54 grandmother had pancreatic cancer at 70 and great aunt had colon cancer at 65. no one else has cancer in my large family. could i have the brca gene?
this test is most useful if there is more than one member of the family with breast cancer and or ovarian cancer. furthermore this type of breast cancer ooccurs below the age of 45 years. so i do not think it would be useful for you to do this test. it is also quite expensive to do this test.
my mom had breast cancer. she is doing well but she has the braca 2 mutation. what are the chances she passed it down to me? when should i get tested?
your chance of having your mother's mutation is 50% and you could test now that you are sexually mature. you only need to test for that particular mutation (single site analysis) unless there is suspicious family history in your dad's side too or you are of eastern europe jewish ethnicity. one of the families i follow has a different mutation from each side so it can happen. best to you.
my mom had breast cancer. she is doing well but she has the braca 2 mutation. what are the chances she passed it down to me? when should i get tested?
you have a 50% chance of having the mutation.
my girlfriend has just been diagnosed with grade 3 breast cancer if she goes into remission what are the chances it comes back?
grade reflects the appearance in microscope view and can be associated w/ any stage. stage 3 cancers are further divided in 3a & 3b with wide range of survival/recurrence. stage is the predictor you want to know. please check w/ your doctor for specific term.

my aunt has 3c breast cancer for how much months/years will she be treated? how much can she live? can she be able to lead her normal life again?
with today's treatments pt. have a better chance at a longer and increased quality of life. during treatment she may not feel we'll and in terms of how long she had to live no one knows.
mother had tubular-lobular breast cancer and they also found a small area of dcis during mastectomy pathological analysis. is this common?
complete pathology review following mastectomy surgery can often identify other small microscopic lesions. dcis is a non-invasive early brsst cancer & would not affect the prognosis nor likely change her treatment plans. this is also an example of why additional treatment with hormone & radiation therapy is given if a person had only had a lumpectomy surgery.
my sister is a breast cancer survivor. she has chest pain and her doctor told her she has fluid around her heart. what does this mean? is this real ba
please have your sister work with her doctors to find out why she has a pericardial effusion or fluid around her heart and chest pain. until the reason is figured out the significance is uncertain. it could be anything from benign fluid unrelated to her chest pain or possibly percarditis - an inflammation of the lining (pericardium) around the heart or something more concerning.
my sister is a breast cancer survivor. she has chest pain and her doctor told her she has fluid around her heart. what does this mean? is this real ba
technically it is called a plueral effusion and can be do several reasons including infection and cancer related. she should be checked for fluid in other areas including abdomen and around lungs. ultimately if the fluid increases in amount it should be removed to prevent inability of the heart to function do to the surrounding pressure of the effusion. should have close follow up with heart dr.
might somebody have breast cancer at the age of 15?
but very very rare.
might somebody have breast cancer at the age of 15?
this age group is virtually zero but it is not impossible. the vast majority of breast lumps in adolescents are benign.
might somebody have breast cancer at 14?
this age group is virtually zero but it is not impossible. the vast majority of breast lumps in adolescents are benign.
might somebody have breast cancer at 14?
impossible anything is possible. but breast cancer in this age groups is rare. occasionally you can get benign tumors or sarcomas of the breast.
my mom has currently been diagnosed with a form of breast cancer and my aunt on my father's side has had breast cancer. should i be concerned?
family history is important and having a 1st degree relative increases your risk. you should be doing self breast exams and seeing a doctor at least once a year for clinical exams. however that risk depends on other factors. how old was your mom or aunt at diagnosis? was the cancer in both breasts or only one? are there other cancers in the family? discuss a screening plan with your doctor.
my mom has currently been diagnosed with a form of breast cancer and my aunt on my father's side has had breast cancer. should i be concerned?
breast cancer does have some hereditary tendencies. so you should be alert and watchful yet not worry too much about it. the precautions should include breast self examination/ awareness for any change in size shape and get to know the normal feel. a breast examination by your doctor once yearly is a good idea. once you get past 40 years of age an annual mammographic examination is advised.
mother has breast cancer at 53 her father had colon at 87 her paternal uncle had aml at 65 and her paternal cousin aml at 50. hereditary?
rare genetic syndrome called li fraumeni. but could be just sporadic. i think it would be reasonable to do two things: 1) have a cbc done 2) consider meeting with a genetic counselor. hope this helps.
mother has breast cancer at 53 her father had colon at 87 her paternal uncle had aml at 65 and her paternal cousin aml at 50. hereditary?
most of your family members are developing their cancers later in life and there is not an obvious pattern of inheritance from this limited amount of info. i'd talk about this with your doc and do a quick pedigree analysis. modern techniques are revealing correlations that we couldn't see in the past. so a good history can be helpful to tease out any possible association.
mother has breast cancer at 53 her father had colon at 87 her paternal uncle had aml at 65 and her paternal cousin aml at 50. hereditary?
if no other members of your family has breast or colon cancers then your parents has disease at random not genetic etiology. your uncle family has acute myeloid leukemia in two members in two generations possibly genetic ( hereditary ) may be have cebpa mutation or some thing else you have to speak to the oncologist with patients permission and may need investigation.
my breast skin gets dry very soon. it gets ichy and dry near nipple area. it happens to me usually. i have started applying moisterizer on it. but i feel scary is it breast cancer?
most of the time this is dermatologic such as excema or an allergic reaction or possibly irritation from clothing. there is a type of breast cancer known as paget's disease of the nipple that can present as an excoriated lesion on the nipple or areola. if this does not resolve consider seeing a dermatologist or breast surgeon. although unlikely a biopsy would be a very quick simple procedure.
my breast skin gets dry very soon. it gets ichy and dry near nipple area. it happens to me usually. i have started applying moisterizer on it. but i feel scary is it breast cancer?
breast cancer worry is especially true for someone who has family history of breast cancer so that screening should be done early in their twenties. at 36 an early difficult diagnosis to worry is paget's disease especially if that part of your breast looks and feels different from the other side. any nipple discharge can be examined. see your family or gyne doctor if you are so worried.
mother had breast cancer at 54 and grandmother had pancreatic cancer at 70. my insurance won't cover the brca testing. what do i do? it's $4000!
brca testing is reserved for women who are at significant risk for the hereditary type of breast cancer. while it is possible that your mom is brca (+) the odds are less than 10% unless she was under 45 at diagnosis other family members had breast or ovarian ca had bilateral-or "triple negative" breast ca etc. either way it is best to test your mom first; if she's (-) no need to be tested.
mother had breast cancer at 54 and grandmother had pancreatic cancer at 70. my insurance won't cover the brca testing. what do i do? it's $4000!
increased screening tests with your doc like blood work and scans that may be covered and the supeme court just ruled they do not have a monopoloy on that test so in the next few years other companies will most likely be able to offer similar tests and the price will be much cheaper!
mother had breast cancer at 54 and grandmother had pancreatic cancer at 70. my insurance won't cover the brca testing. what do i do? it's $4000!
i would suggest seeing a surgeon for a breast exam. get a baseline mammogram at age 35 and then yearly at 40. one could also consider getting a mri of the breasts the same time you get your first mammogram. just a consideration. hope this helps.
mother had breast cancer at 54 and grandmother had pancreatic cancer at 70. my insurance won't cover the brca testing. what do i do? it's $4000!
see a genetic counselor if you haven't already. and don't be too stressed! we already know your risk for breast cancer is higher because of your mom. so start preventive measures including exercise reduce alcohol (less than 4 drinks a week) keep your weight down do self breast exams and remind your doctors about your family history. that's more important than genetic testing for you!
mother had breast cancer in mid fifties now i'm worried i'll get it. nobody else in family had it. should i get prophylactic mastectomy?
your chance of getting breast cancer with a positive maternal history is still only about 15%. (50% higher than a negative history. ) however if a brca test was positive your odds would jump to about 85-86%. i would suggest a brca test if you really want to consider preemptive surgery. speak to your primary physician and see what can be done. good luck.
mother had breast cancer in mid fifties now i'm worried i'll get it. nobody else in family had it. should i get prophylactic mastectomy?
see a oncologist and get checked for risk of developing cancer.
my 34 yr old wife has a lump in her breast and has recently stopped nursing our 15 month old daughter. could this be breast cancer?
this is not likely to be cancer given the more common blocked ducts or irritated ducts found in nursing mothers. but it should not be ignored and her physician should be informed. if the lump hurts or is growing please make that visit with the doctor soon.
my 34 yr old wife has a lump in her breast and has recently stopped nursing our 15 month old daughter. could this be breast cancer?
most common cause is a benign galactocele. nonetheless you should absolutely have an evaluation with at least an ultrasound.
md today said my breast tenderness at 68 is probably caused by finasteride. if i stop taking it how long would it take for tenderness to disappear?
many urologists that see these patients recommend the patient see a general surgeon for removal of the tissue. it does take 6-12 mo for finasteride to completely get out of your system. the removal of the mammary tissue can allow you to stay on it if you need it for an enlarged prostate. there are rare instances of breast cancer in men. not as rare as you would think though.
my mother had breast cancer at 48. i 37 andy doctor recommended me to get a mammogram. is it a baseline check and or necessary?
typically recommend baseline at 35 in women who have first degree relative (mother) with breast cancer. or begin routine screening at 10 years younger than the age of the youngest relative w breast cancer at their age of diagnosis. usually will not screen with mammograms yearly in women younger than 30.
my mother had breast cancer at 48. i 37 andy doctor recommended me to get a mammogram. is it a baseline check and or necessary?
while recommendations vary many doctors recommend beginning screenings 10 years younger than the youngest family member who had breast cancer. so if your mom was 48 at diagnosis then you would start at 38. some groups recommend a baseline at 35 and then yearly at 40 for women with a family history. so you are getting good advice.
my mother had breast cancer at 48. i 37 andy doctor recommended me to get a mammogram. is it a baseline check and or necessary?
about ten years prior to your mom's cancer is typical to obtaining your baseline mammogram. get a very good family history from both mom and dad then look into having your mom tested for hereditary breast cancer. if she's neg for the abnormal gene then you don't have to worry nearly as much. just keep getting screened yearly starting ten yrs prior to mom's cancer. supreme court lowered testing $$!
my mother had breast cancer at 48. i 37 andy doctor recommended me to get a mammogram. is it a baseline check and or necessary?
this is an appropriate time to have a baseline mammo considering the family history.
mammo:ill marginated focal assymetry sono:two lipomas or intramamary lymphs mri:looks benign but birads 4 and recommends biopsy. im confused/scared!
i would advise that you consult a breast cancer surgeon or medical oncologist who has reputation of being a specialist in breast diseases/cancer. based on your history you may need to have a biopsy of the lumps/masses/ shadows that you have mentioned. that is the final solution to any palpable/visible lump in the breast. this will remove your anxiety which is due to the uncertainty you are facin.
my first breast cancer tested me for tsh and my new doctor tested for fsh why the different tests and what does each mean?
the tsh looks at thyroid function the fsh looks at ovarian function. he may have been testing the fsh to see if you are going into menopause.
my first breast cancer tested me for tsh and my new doctor tested for fsh why the different tests and what does each mean?
tsh. thyroid stimulating hormone. fsh. follicular cell stimulating hormone. lh. luteinizing hormone usually done with fsh.

chances are slim but not zero. does your mother have an abnormal gene?
my tumour marker with 1mm breast cancer invasion was 9. 3. after mastectomy it is still 9. 3. does that mean it wasnt actually cancer?
breast cancer is diagnosed with a microscope not a blood test. your tumor marker being normal before and after surgery tells me nothing at all. people may have cancer and their marker can be normal or have an elevated marker without having cancer. best of luck to you.
my tumour marker with 1mm breast cancer invasion was 9. 3. after mastectomy it is still 9. 3. does that mean it wasnt actually cancer?
there's no scientific tumor marker for a 1 mm breast cancer. perhaps this is a misunderstanding. there are some unscientific "tumor markers" offered as blood tests by charlatans but nothing in evidence-based medicine to indicate a small breast cancer has been excised.
my mom-in-law had breast cancer 5 years ago. she got breast implants done. she has recently gone throughradiation to cure cancer again. now a bump has appeared. what should i do?
checked to make sure it isn't a cancer recurrence or an implant problem.
my mom-in-law had breast cancer 5 years ago. she got breast implants done. she has recently gone throughradiation to cure cancer again. now a bump has appeared. what should i do?
doctor(s) as soon as she can. any new physical finding or symptom needs to be evaluated by a physician especially given her history. it may be nothing but it should be investigated thoroughly. good luck!
my mom-in-law had breast cancer 5 years ago. she got breast implants done. she has recently gone throughradiation to cure cancer again. now a bump has appeared. what should i do?
your mother in law needs an evaluation. while most causes are benign this warrants further work up. it could be a simple folding of the implant or scar tissue but let a professional help her with determining that.
my mom-in-law had breast cancer 5 years ago. she got breast implants done. she has recently gone throughradiation to cure cancer again. now a bump has appeared. what should i do?

my mom has breast cancer in brain. wondering if there are any natural treatments such as cannabis oil or anything else that we can do now?
there are two sites that i know of that cover naturopathic methods to help palliate cancer symptoms. one is through the goshen cancer center in indiana. the other is memorial sloan kettering cancer center in new york. if you go to either website and look for the naturopathic or alternative medicine site they may have suggests and/or contact information for you.
my mom has breast cancer in brain. wondering if there are any natural treatments such as cannabis oil or anything else that we can do now?
standard therapy is radiation. hope this helps.
my mom has breast cancer in brain. wondering if there are any natural treatments such as cannabis oil or anything else that we can do now?
are to speak with an oncologist regarding a treatment plan. i suppose that some docs may advocate cannabis for cancer related pain but this will not treat the cancer itself.
my mom has breast cancer in brain. wondering if there are any natural treatments such as cannabis oil or anything else that we can do now?
many of the treatments for cancer and other disorders are derived from plants especially from the rain forests. at this time i would discuss the alternatives with your mothe's doctor to explore alternatives to treatment.
my mum has breast cancer at the moment she is 48 and my grandmother on my dad's side had it at 65 is it a bad idea to be on the pill?
the data are still conflicted and it will likely depend on your genetics (estrogen sensitive) as well as the estrogen content of the pill. this should be discussed with your family physician or gynecologist.
my doctor scheduled me for a mammogram at 18. what are some possible reasons?
j: do you have a very strong family history of breast cancer (mother sister)? a mammogram is usually not needed until age 40. in someone as young as you if you are having a problem we would start with a sonogram. there is no radiation with a sonogram and often a mammogram at that young age would not be helpful. see if you can clarify the reasons for the mammogram before you get it.
my girlfriend has just been diagnosed with grade 3 breast cancer if she goes into remission what do we do?
if you really mean grade 3 breast cancer that is usually referring to pathologic type but has much less significance than stage 3 breast cancer which is a more advanced breast cancer usually with significant size and invasion and/or spread to lymph nodes. in any case if she goes into remission by being treated she needs continued followup for which this depends on the stage and treatment.
my girlfriend has invasive ductal breast cancer what are her chances of a full recovery? she is 40.
on many factors including the stage of the cancer and other prognostic features about the tumor like it's grade (1-3) if the er/pr markers are + or - if the her2neu is + or - if the ki-67 is high or low and how good her general health is otherwise. depends also on if she follows through with all recommended treatments or not.
multiple pimple different sizes 1-3 cm together on the infra scapula reg. of patient has metastatic breast cancer could be related to cancer?
hash the bast and safest thing to do is seek out a board certified dermatologist. these may be simple pimples a sign of immune changes or others. if possible and they look like a cancer then a simple biopsy would give you all the answers.
multiple pimple different sizes 1-3 cm together on the infra scapula reg. of patient has metastatic breast cancer could be related to cancer?
it is difficult to say without more information. these could be a reaction or a side effect of treatment but breast cancer can recur as skin lesions that can resemble small pimples. these should be examined by her oncologist. a simple biopsy may be recommended.
multiple pimple different sizes 1-3 cm together on the infra scapula reg. of patient has metastatic breast cancer could be related to cancer?
breast cancer can metastasize to skin - see your oncologist.
my boobs hurt when i press near the middle. i'm soo scared is it breast cancer?
is not a warning sign of cancer but it could be an infection or some other type of inflammation. you should have undergone mammogram at age 40 and if it was completely normal chances of breast cancer might be lower. but you need to make sure so see your doctor.
mum has breast cancer please give me advice on how we can deal with this?
a medical oncology specialist to help direct the proper treatments & general surgeon or breast surgery specialist to recommend the proper surgery. early stages have excellent outcomes. best wishes.
my mum has breast cancer scared that i may have it too. what do i need to do?
if you have a lump then call your doctor and get checked out and get a mammogram. depending on the age of your mother at diagnosis and cancer type she may be a candidate for brca gene testing.
my mum has breast cancer scared that i may have it too. what do i need to do?
it is always scary when a relative gets cancer. if you have not had a mammogram yet i would recommend one. one has to remember that breast is a common cancer which is why we spend so much effort on surveillance. it is also often found early stages. depending on your mothers age the type of breast cancer and how it was detected your primary care doctor and go over the current surveillance recs.
my oncologist thinks i have an abscess. he did a blood culture so i will get results. big painful lump still there. is it inflammatory breast cancer?
what is the extent of inflammation around the underlying breast mass? has an ultrasound of the breast been done? a surgeon with ultrasound can determine if there is an abscess and aspirated it clean the cavity and with serial treatments possibly resolve the infection without necessitating an open i & d of the abscess.
are people who are born with brca gene at a higher risk for recurrence of cancer too?
breast cancer may recur either in the breast ("local recurrence") or elsewhere in the body (distant metastasis). the risk of metastasis varies from very low to high and is correlated with the stage of the cancer. local recurrence following lumpectomy and radiation therapy is less than 5%. however brca(+) people do have a (much) higher risk of developing a second primary breast cancer.
after a mastectomy is it possible to get lung cancer?
there is nothing about a mastectomy that would prevent someone from developing an (unrelated) primary lung cancer. breast cancer can spread (metastasize) to the lung; the chances are the same whether a women is treated by mastectomy or lumpectomy (plus radiation therapy).
after a mastectomy is it possible to get lung cancer?
the short answer is yes. there are two types of lung cancer: primary and secondary. secondary cancer to the lung is cancer from another origin that spreads to the lung (like breast cancer). anyone can get primary lung cancer or non-small cell. higher risk individuals are smokers and individiduals with family history. for more info: <link>
are breast cancer and bone cancer related?
breast cancer can spread to the bones; this is called metastasis. this is the closest relationship.
are breast cancer and bone cancer related?
what makes any cancer "evil" is its ability to break away from its organ of origin and travel thru the body taking up residence in other organs; this secondary organ involvement is referred to as metastases. the bones are a common site of breast ca mets. rx hinges upon chemotherapy to kill as many cancer cells as possible supplemented by radiation therapy to control its growth (and symptoms).
are males automatically examined for breast cancer?
breast cancer is uncommon in males and usually presents with a lump that the individual feels. if you feel a breast lump tell your doc - it may not be picked up on a routine physical.
are males automatically examined for breast cancer?
most mean with breast cancer are diagnosed because of a new lump that is present. is a breast exam a part of every male physical? probably not although it should be.
are women who have had breast cancer more likely to develop deep vein thrombosis?
early stage breast cancer is associated with a very minimal risk of dvt although some of the treatments (estrogen blockage) may increase that risk as does smoking. advanced stages of most cancers are associated with increased dvt.
are women who have had breast cancer more likely to develop deep vein thrombosis?
active cancer increases the risk of dvt.
are women who have had breast cancer more likely to develop deep vein thrombosis?
active cancer increases risk for dvt significantly. tamoxifen can increase risk for dvt and pe. see this link for guidance. <link>
are soy products recommended for those with a family history of breast cancer?
there is no specific recommendations regarding nutritional supplements (ie soy) and cancer. remember that there is little to no control over safety or efficacy of nutritional supplements.
are soy products recommended for those with a family history of breast cancer?
this topic is controversial. some believe that the estrogen found in soy products increase the risk of breast cancer. the data is unclear on this.
are there different types of breast cancer? how many different types of breast cancer are there?
main types are non-invasive or invasive. then there can be lobular or ductal forms of these non-invasive (in situ) or invasive cancers. there are then variations of hormone receptor positive or negative her2/neu positive or negative and then many variations of cell type aggressiveness and dna variations too.
are there different types of breast cancer? how many different types of breast cancer are there?
the most common type of breast cancer is invasive ductal cancer. less commonly lobular. rarer are medullary tubular etc. however even within ductal the cancers may be different in cause and behavior as determined by expressions of estrogen progesterone and her-2 neu receptors. more recently gene sequencing has shown tremendous variations in mutations. go search for new articles.
after a biopsy i was diagnosed with breast cancer. the doctor said it is in the lymph nodes. i got results that came out negative but instead said metastatic breast. what does this mean?
typically breast cancer spreads first to regional lymph nodes and then to other parts of the body. once breast cancer spreads to the lymph nodes it is considered to have metastasized. it would be critical to understand exactly what results were "negative" to determine its significance.
after a biopsy i was diagnosed with breast cancer. the doctor said it is in the lymph nodes. i got results that came out negative but instead said metastatic breast. what does this mean?
i am not sure what you mean. what tests were negative? pathology evaluation of a biopsy sample is the only way to know for sure. radiology findings or other tests may suggest or imply a lack of cancer but a biopsy will tell for certain.
about how long can someone live with metastatic breast cancer?
the avergae survival of metastatic breast cancer patients is 2-3 years but it is highly variable and can range from 6 months to 10+ years! . patients who have only one organ involved or if the cancer is limited to bones only tend to live for 4-5 years on an average.
about how long can someone live with metastatic breast cancer?
depends on where & how much metastatic disease cell type response to chemotherapy & underlying medical conditions. some patients can live many years and some may not do as well.
are there certain types of food that are good for people with breast cancer?
good healthful food which is low in fat and avoids too much sugar so that your weight is kept in the normal/healthful range is recommended. also daily exercise will help to keep you healthy.

nutrition is extremely important. here is a link with some useful information: <link> here is another useful link: <link>
are people with big breasts more likely to get breast cancer?
it's a little tricky to sort this out as breast size correlates somewhat with obesity. the impact of size alone is not dramatic.
are people with big breasts more likely to get breast cancer?
individual breast size itself does not increase breast cancer risks but in some studies overall obesity can increase breast cancer risks.
an mri in nov 2012 showed a radiological cyst on l. femur; pain since may 2012. i have stage 111c breast cancer. should i get a pet /ct?
on mri cysts are pretty easily distinguished from metastasis from breast cancer. if you still have concerns ask your oncologist if he can have the mri interpreted by a second radiologist to make all are in agreement with the cyst diagnosis.
an mri in nov 2012 showed a radiological cyst on l. femur; pain since may 2012. i have stage 111c breast cancer. should i get a pet /ct?
help much but please see your doctor and complete the workup. if the first mri did not include iv contrast then a repeat mri with contrast may be helpful. also what did the cyst look like on plain radiographs (x-rays) or a ct? you need to get an answer to your pain as well as a definite answer about whether the bone cyst could be cancer. please get a full workup for the answers.
after finding a breast lump i had a blood test that came back normal. is it still possible to have breast cancer?
there is not a blood test to detect breast cancer. if there is an abnormal lump you need a mammogram and ultrasound and then a biopsy to make a diagnosis. only a biopsy which is taking a sample of the lump can determine if you do or do not have breast cancer. a biopsy can be done with a needle and results obtained in 24-72hours. see a breast specialist for evaluation-do not delay!
after finding a breast lump i had a blood test that came back normal. is it still possible to have breast cancer?
blood tests tell almost nothing about whether or not you have breast cancer. blood tests can only give us informatin about your overall health such as your blood cell counts and your liver and kidney function. a breast lump should be evaluated with a mammogram a breast ultrasound a breast mri a breast biopsy or some combination of the above.
are these symptoms exclusive to breast cancer- darkening pain and skin peeling of the area where the lump is? if not what could it be?

are there different ways someone can get breast cancer?
heredity and lifestyle risks such as obesity lack of exrcise prolonged use of hormone medication cigarette smoking can be linked to a variety of cancers. only about 15% of breast cancers are linked to hereditary factors. others occur randomly.
are there different ways someone can get breast cancer?
genetic likely 10-15%. most are acquired. most are associated with th ducts; others the lobule. the ductal ones cause microcalcification and are more visible on mammogram. the lobular tends to be hard to feel (like a puff bll of cotton) and harder to see with x-rays.
are there any natural ways to enlarge your breasts? i'm tired of hearing about augumentation. please tell me about the pills or creams that really work.
the reason you won't be hearing about creams or pills that "mean it" is because there aren't any that really work. none. not even a little bit. they work to reduce your wallet and your breasts remain the same (maybe a little swollen from all the massage). fat grafting is not recommended as it can interfere with the detection of breast cancer via mammogram. implants are still the best option. truly.
advanced lobular breast cancer. what is the success rate when a mastectomy 3rd generation chemotherapy and radiation is done?
may be good but need much more detailed information on tumor size stage lymph nodes hormone receptors etc. your own oncologist would be in a much better position to help answer this question for you.
advanced lobular breast cancer. what is the success rate when a mastectomy 3rd generation chemotherapy and radiation is done?
not enough information. depends on tnm staging. treatment decisions based on that as well as biomarkers - er pr her2/neu. the absolute risk reduction provided by chemotherapy and/or hormonal therapy can then be individualized. on useful online tool is adjuvant! online. that assumes adequate local control - eg surgery +/- radiation.

at what usual age does a woman start noticing the early signs/symptoms of breast cancer?
the older a woman becomes the risks of breast cancer can increase there are no early symptoms of breast cancer. early breast cancers are only seen on mammogram and are too small to feel and cause no symptoms. start yearly mammograms at age 40 and have yearly physical exams.
anybody have any other alternatives for breast cancer screening?
mean by alternatives? the commonly accepted screening tools are mammography with supplementation by ultrasound. sometimes ultrasound alone is used in young women as a first line tool. mri can be a very helpful evaluating exam in patients with dense/complex breast tissue or increased risk because of genetic markers or family history.

you have a lump or other breast changes that concern you a physician should be seen right away. otherwise screening mammograms in women without other risk factors are advised starting at age 40.
are there alternatives to mammogram for breast cancer screening?
mammograms are the best test for detecting breast cancer. it is not clear that breast exams by a health care provider add benefit (tho they may) and breast self exams have not been shown to be beneficial. certainly if you notice a bump a change in skin a nipple discharge or any abnormality that you are concerned about you should get it checked out.
are there alternatives to mammogram for breast cancer screening?
is currently the standard of care for screening. it has the most scientific validation and whatever its imperfections(no test is perfect) all of the other potential screening modalities are more imperfect for various reasons. ultrasound and mri have niche screening roles in special situations.

this depends on the biology of the cancer and the initial stage of the disease when brought to medical attention. "triple-negative" breast cancers (er- pr- her2-) are more likely to result in brain metastases than "hormone-receptor" positive breast cancers which tend to have slower courses of recurrence and don't usually show up in the brain. talk to your surgeon or oncologist for more info!

no blood tests would help to diagnose breast cancer. the only way to diagnose cancer is biopsy of the lump once it is confirmed to be real on an x-ray(mammogram). so you are advised to find a doctor who knows how to investigate a lump in breast which most dcotors do. but a physical exam is the first step in order to decide if an x-ray or ultrasound is needed. any palpable lump requires biopsy.
after breast cancer a year ago mas. chemo and rad. my tumor numbers are 10 is that good?
i'm guessing you are talking about ca 27. 29 which can go up in patients with active cancer. a value of 10 is normal but that does not totally rule out cancer nor does an elevated level automatically mean cancer. in fact standards of care do not include routinely testing patients with markers even though many of us do (mea culpa). do not get obsessed by a number it is just another tool we use.

breast mri effectiveness? is a mri the most effective breast imaging test?
it is the most sensitive breast imaging study (detects the greatest number of lesions) but is not the most specific (a lot of these lesions are not malignant and some will need to be biopsied to prove that they are not malignant. ) it is only recommended that a woman obtain a breast mri if she is at high risk of breast cancer (strong family history etc). talk with your doctor about it.
breast reconstruction after breast cancer. why can't i find a doctor to take my medicade? i am trying to have breast reconstruction surgery after breast cancer.

this is a difficult problem as more and more hospitals are turning away medicaid patients as the cost to treat them is much more than the reimbursement by medicaid. saying that- keep searching. our cancer center in orlando does accept medicaid. call 321-841-7090 to find out more.
breast reconstruction after breast cancer. why can't i find a doctor to take my medicade? i am trying to have breast reconstruction surgery after breast cancer.
sorry about your issue here. i am not familiar with your medicaid policy. i do accept medicare here in california. it is ironic though that the government frequently speaks of medicare cutbacks. however doctors often make very little profit or even lose money while treating medicare patients. people frequently view doctors as eternally wealthy. however with the cost of malpractice insurance office rent and staffing the cost to run a practice is high. and one can only continue to practice for so long when making little or no profit. unfortunately there is more and more business administration in medicine than there ever has been. though we don't like to view health care as a business it certainly plays a role. keep looking. you will find help. it may just take time and effort. good luck!
breast reconstruction after breast cancer. why can't i find a doctor to take my medicade? i am trying to have breast reconstruction surgery after breast cancer.
breast reconstruction is federally mandated as a medical necessity and therefore covered by insurance no matter what coverage you have incluidnh medicaid. the problem is that not all doctors accept medicaid. you will need to call around to local plastic surgeons to find one that will be willing to take care of you. you can check with your primary physician for a recommendation but ulimately it will be up to the individual surgeon.
breast reduction i am 33 without children i have constant pain in my neck back and shoulders and very bad migraines which i'm not sure if that can be a factor as well. i am considering breast reduction surgery i know i will have to quit smoking before
breast reduction surgery for women who have large breasts and suffer from chronic neck upper back and shoulder pain is certainly a reasonable possible course of action after other courses of action have been exhausted. it often makes the muscular headaches better. it does not unfortunately improve migraine headaches. that will need further evaluation and is often improved with medication diet alteration and avoiding migraine triggers. mammography or breast ultrasound is a very reasonable test due to your strong family history of breast cancer. you will need to speak with your physicians and insurance company to see if this is a covered benefit. remember that a test may be reasonable but still not covered by your insurance company. you might need to be forceful. hope this info helps.

t: size of the largest primary focus (don't add multiple foci n: nodal involvement (and total number of involved nodes) m: presence of distant mets the various combinations determine the pathologic stage. we are moving away from this sort of staging towards biologic/genomic staging that further subdivides the types of breast cancer and will allow better targeted therapy.
breast cancer : how long and how much exposure to the pill or hormone treatment causes it?
most studies show that birth control pills do not increase the risk of breast cancer. prolonged usage of post-menopausal ert probably increases risk. for most women short term ( a few years) of ert to help menopausal symptoms is probably safe (unless you are at high risk) but i recommend decreasing dosage after 2-4 years and trying to get off estrogen altogether unless symptoms are intolerable.
breast cancer : how long and how much exposure to the pill or hormone treatment causes it?
the birth control pill for a premenopausal woman and hormone therapy for a postmenopausal woman are completely different situations. in the former there is no increased risk of breast cancer. in the latter there is probably a small measurable increased risk after 4 years but it is not clear how that is affected by the types and routes of administration of the estrogen and progesterone.

breast cancer ulcerated tumor (cancer is isolated in one area only) could i opt for radiation to shrink tumor prior to surgery or must i have chemo?
a tumor such as yours is classified as a locally advanced tumor; if surgery is done first a mastectomy is the only option. however if chemorx is given first (neoadjuvant rx) there is a chance that the tumor will shrink enough to allow a lumpectomy alone; radiation rx would then be necessary after surgery. preoperative radiation rx is insufficient to rx alone and could complicate the surgery.
breast cancer ulcerated tumor (cancer is isolated in one area only) could i opt for radiation to shrink tumor prior to surgery or must i have chemo?
neoadjuvant chemotherapy (meaning prior to surgery) is sometimes indicated depending on the malignancy type. most "ulcerated tumors" are consistent with inflammatory breast cancer. the recommendations are chemotherapy first followed by surgery (typically a mastectomy in this case) followed by radiation. a mastectomy is indicated for an inflammatory breast cancer.

can elevated ca15-3 mean something other than breast cancer? clear mammo but ca15-3 results - 31. 6 (ca markers done as part of complete physical)
the reference range is set so that 5% of folks believed to be healthy fall above it. usually the top of the reference range is 30 or so. this alone should make you stop worrying. further fairly high values are often observed with no obvious explanation. why was it run in the first place? mild elevations usually just generate confusion and upset people and never detect anything.

by the life of me i can't imagine why anyone is using a tumor marker as part of a routine physical. it is a waste of resources with no proven value. tumor markers are not screening tests only used to follow treatment response in patients with cancer already diagnosed. by the way most labs have an upper limit of normal of 38 so 31. 6 is normal.

women with smaller breast cancers that have not spread outside the breast can often be treated with mastectomy and no radiation or chemotherapy. sometimes hormone treatments will help such women after surgery. if a tumor is larger (more that 5 cm) more aggressive (poorly differentiated triple negative or her2 positive) or in the skin muscle or lymph nodes chemo and or xrt might be needed.
can post surgical inflammation/scarring from breast implants cause cancer later on life?
despite decades of research there is no relationship between breast implants and the development of breast cancer.
can post surgical inflammation/scarring from breast implants cause cancer later on life?
people have looked at this intensively. there's a very rare and distinctive malignant lymphoma that occurs in this setting. i wouldn't waste time worrying about it. the implants don't cause breast cancer. if other cancers result from the scar formation which doesn't make sense biologically they are too uncommon for a risk to be measurable.
could you get breast cancer after a mastectomy?
there could be residual malignant breast tissue in the chest wall (local recurrence) or the cancer could have already spread to other organs before surgery (metastasis).
could you get breast cancer after a mastectomy?
during a mastectomy the surgeon attempts to remove as much breast tissue as possible but no surgeon can remove every last bit of breast tissue. your residual skin/surrounding tissue still has to remain viable. so even with a double mastectomy (removal of both breasts) there is still a very small chance of developing breast cancer at a later time.

how soon after development do most people notice or find out they have breast cancer?
the smallest tumor detectable by a mammogram is 0. 2 mm. cancer starts as a single cell which divides repeatedly. the growth rate(doubling time) of individual breast cancers varies from 80-200 days(time to double in size). the average womens brest cancer has been growing for 12-15 years before it is detected by mammography! an aggressive cancer may take 5-7 years before it is detected by x-ray

it is hard to say without a full family history but your relatives did have cancer at a young age. per nccn guidelines both are candidates for testing (assuming they are still alive). they would be the best subjects for testing and then you may or may not need to. if they can't or won't i advise you talk to your doc to see if a genetic counselor can see you and decide on the proper testing.
my mother had breast cancer at 54 and her cousin was diagnosed at 45. is this likely caused by the brca gene? my insurance won't pay for it.

you and other family members have to convince your mom to under go required surgery and chemo-radiation ( if indicated ) even possible to beat the disease ; cure with proper treatments if necessary she may need special council ( psychiatrist help to convince to under go treatments ). discuss with her doctors with her permission for best available options.
my best friend is fighting stage iv breast cancer an how the cancer spread through her brain and lungs and lymph node what are her chances?
once cancer reaches the brain survival is diminished. but there are long term survivors that have brain metastasis. the best thing that you can do is provide hope and support for her. hope this helps.
my best friend is fighting stage iv breast cancer an how the cancer spread through her brain and lungs and lymph node what are her chances?
according to the american cancer society the 5 year relative survival rate for stage iv breast cancer is 22%.
mom is a breast cancer survivor will that have any effect on her life expectancy?
it depends on the stage of your mom's cancer when she was diagnosed and what treatments she had. her life expectancy should not be affected if her cancer doesn't come back. the higher her stage at diagnosis the more likely her cancer could return. some treatments affect cholesterol levels and heart function both of which can be treated.
my mother has stage 3a breast cancer. what are her chances?
breast cancer has good treatments available. even with stage 3 most women get well and are cured after going through treatment.
my doctor told me to do a breast biopsy what are the chances that i will have cancer if i was told this?
you either have breast cancer and it will destroy you if you neglect it or your mass is benign and your adventure will end with relief and a reminder to keep up lifetime surveillance. i'm not going to tell you what percentage of breast biospies turn out to be malignant as your mass may be more or less suspicious. one woman in two will have a breast biopsy during her lifetime. be brave.
my mom was diagnosed with breastcancer a year ago. lump 1 5 cm. no symptoms pain at all! how long could she have gone with no symptoms?
breast cancer often does not get painful until it gets rather large. a breast cancer usually has to be present for 5 years before it even gets big enough to feel. usually the cancer doesn't cause pain until it invades a nearby area. mammograms and regular examinations are essential to find breast cancer when it can most likely be cured.
my boyfriend is really rough during sex and usually leaves brusies on my boobs. could that caise breast cancer in any way?
bruises in the breast do not cause cancer. if his roughness caused damage to the deep breast tissue it could cause fat necrosis in mammograms tis looks very much like breast cancer.
my boyfriend is really rough during sex and usually leaves brusies on my boobs. could that caise breast cancer in any way?
but maybe he should take it easier on you.
mother had breast ca at 53 her paternal cousin had it at 47. her cousin's mother who she is not related to also had it at 65. likely brca gene?
if any concern get tested for brca. family history of breast cancer does not usually mean brca.
my mom 66 just diagnosed with breast cancer metastasis to bones stomach&lung t3n2m1. put on tamoxifen for 2 mnths. can she benefit from surgery? whats her survival rate in years? how to extend her life?
yes if primary tumor is not removed yes she will debunking will help needs more than tamoxifen speak to the oncologist for chemotherapy. recent advances in chemotherapy changing the survival rate from 23% for better. good luck.
my friend just had a second mastectomy yesterday she would like to know if there's a chance of recurrence?
a mastectomy significantly reduces your chance of developing a new breast cancer but the truth is you are still left with a few breast cells and therefore can still develop breast cancer. there are not enough cells to have a mammogram. simple self chest wall exam would identify any new mass.
my daughter is starting to grow breast. she is ten years old. something hard is inside. some website said its breast cancer or bud. i am not sure.
thelarche is the term used for the emergence of breast tissue in the beginning stages of puberty. a spongy bit of true breast tissue is located directly under the nipple on one or both sides. it can be tender to touch ; one side may emerge weeks before the other. your pcp can confirm this process i hav at least 3-5 /yr come to my office for the same question.
my daughter is starting to grow breast. she is ten years old. something hard is inside. some website said its breast cancer or bud. i am not sure.
let her doctor examine her just it could be due to breast growth being breast cancer has impossible odds.
my mom has had a distended stomach for months. she recently had radiation for breast cancer. docs have done several tests. nothing is showing up. help?
the cause of abdominal distention can be many. it is not hard to find the cause. a ct can of the abdomen can show all that is there. it could be fat fluid or growths in the abdomen all of which will show in the ct scan. so get one done. if ct scan does not show anything then there is nothing serious going on in the abdomen.
my aunt has breast cancer & also my mother. 3 weeks ago my aunt did the genetic test &the results came negative. does my mom has to do the test also?
significant family history (also check for uterine ovarian colon prostate). could have implications for you if positive on your mom.
my aunt has breast cancer & also my mother. 3 weeks ago my aunt did the genetic test &the results came negative. does my mom has to do the test also?
depends on how many first (parent sibling etc) and second degree relatives (aunts grand parents) have cancer ; the type of cancer. if there are other female cancers in the family then genetic counseling and testing may be indicated.
mother had lobular breast cancer at 52-- post menopause. negative for brca genes atm p53 cdh1 etc. is there a strong likelihood i'll get it a well?
various causes result in breast cancer in a family. if braca is neg then there is no genetic relationship to getting the ca. exposure to the mmtv virus probably results in 80% chance of having a tumor. also recognized that endogenous sequences of virus can be passed and when proper reorganization of the sequences takes place the viral genome can induce cancer.
mother had lobular breast cancer at 52-- post menopause. negative for brca genes atm p53 cdh1 etc. is there a strong likelihood i'll get it a well?
some genetic changes leaves a patient more susceptible to breast cancer. however i believe it's more important what your genetic profile is than your mother. there is clearly a familial link in breast cancer. you should check with a breast surgeon in your area or a general surgeon with a special interest in breast disease to find out more.
mama was 8 years ago to have breast cancer but now in the bones doctors thought it secondary bone cancer but it turns out that he has nothing to do?
it's common for breast cancer to spread to the bones even decades later. this is especially true if the breast cancer was positive for the estrogen receptor (er positive). in these cases we usually give patients an estrogen-blocking pill to treat the cancer. we also give a drug that hardens the bones (zolendronate). ask your doctor why your mother isn't being given those treatments.
mama was 8 years ago to have breast cancer but now in the bones doctors thought it secondary bone cancer but it turns out that he has nothing to do?
there is never "nothing to do" in a cancer patient. i am going to assume that hormonal therapy and herceptin (trastuzumab) are not options in your mother's case. now this becomes a problem for the pain management team and for hospice who can help your mother spend her time with comfort and dignity. spend time with her as you are able. best wishes.
my mother who is seventy has been diagnosed with breast cancer. how survivable is breast cancer for women her age?
on the stage and other factors. a very small node negative cancer has good chances of survival whereas a stage 4 cancer is deemed incurable.
mammogram with no signs or symptoms of breast cancer. result 0. 6 cm asymmetry in the central region of breast what does this mean?
screening mammo? it sounds like there is a potential abnormality. were additional views recommended? 80% of the time this turns out to be nothing of concern. talk to your doctor about the next steps.
mammogram with no signs or symptoms of breast cancer. result 0. 6 cm asymmetry in the central region of breast what does this mean?
probably just means that the breasts were asymmetric. meaning that the left and right breasts appeared different. hope this helps.
mammogram with no signs or symptoms of breast cancer. result 0. 6 cm asymmetry in the central region of breast what does this mean?
mean you need a breast examination if you have not have one might need to repeat the test in six month.
my sister had breast cancer in both breast am i a high risk for breast cancer?
women with close relatives with breast cancer are at increased risk of breast cancer themselves.
my sister had breast cancer in both breast am i a high risk for breast cancer?
it is important that your sister get evaluated for the brca gene. i highly recommend that you find a high risk breast clinic at your local breast center to get evaluated for your race which may also include genetic testing.
my sister had breast cancer in both breast am i a high risk for breast cancer?
any othet family members including extended family with breast ovarian uterine prostate kidney pancreatc cancers? considergenetic testing.
my grandma has lumps on her breast. by any chance would it be breast cancer? how will we know?
in order to diagnose if a breast lump is cancer requires a physical exam possibly a mammogram and or an ultrasound. it may even require a biopsy to prove or disprove. please see your doctor for the proper evaluation.
mother had breast cancer at 54 her cousin had it at 47. brca negative. is this likely genetic?
brca 1;2 are not the only genes that can increase the risk for breast cancer so you cannot rule out an inherited trait. that said they could be sporadic cancers too. i suggest you visit a specialist with expertise in risk assessment and genetics. he/she needs to do a full pedigree and get some personal info to estimate your cancer risk and decide if you (or your mom) need additional testing.
my mother had breast cancer at 54 does this mean i'll get it? is it still more likely i won't? brca negative.
having a mother with breast cancer doesn't mean that you will get breast cancer for sure. it does put you at increased risk of developing breast cancer.
my mother had breast cancer at 54 does this mean i'll get it? is it still more likely i won't? brca negative.
only 15% of breast cancer is related to heredity. the vast majority of breast cancer is not. so you probably have a slightly higher chance then the average woman. it depends on other factors too like your age when you started menstruating number of pregnancies etc.
my mother had breast cancer at 54 does this mean i'll get it? is it still more likely i won't? brca negative.
the risk of breast cancer for you is there but it is not very high unless there are other first degree relatives(aunts sisters) who have had breast cancer or ovarian cancer. 90% of the women in your situation will not get breast cancer. yet you need to be aware of what you need to do to be on your guard and adopt preventive measures. and check your breasts for any lumps regulalrly(monthly basis).
my mother had breast cancer at 54 does this mean i'll get it? is it still more likely i won't? brca negative.
your mother having breast cancer at 54 does not mean you will get it or you would have brca gene mutation. it is simply a very complicated question and requires more information to assess. woman’s breast cancer risk is determined by multiple factors and can be assessed by gail model through national cancer institute website. briefly most breast cancer occurs sporadically rather than throug.
my mother has stage 4 metastatic breast cancer. she's on faslodex (fulvestrant) evey 28 days. is it ok if she gets the shot 5 days later than usual once. day 33?
she needs to speak to her oncologist about this.
my mom died from colon cancer so did her mom. my mom's sister died frm breast cancer and brother died from lung cancer. how likely am i to get cancer?
you should see a genetic counselor who can look at your family tree and give you a better idea. the most worrisome possibility from what you have described is so far would be lynch syndrome in which calling cancer (and others) run in families. you should definitely get a colonoscopy if you've not done so yet. for more info www. askyourgynecologist. org.
my mom died from colon cancer so did her mom. my mom's sister died frm breast cancer and brother died from lung cancer. how likely am i to get cancer?
the risks of cancer depend on whether there is an abnormal gene that is inherited or a family grouping not related to a specific gene. it would be important to look at the entire family tree and decide about genetic testing or other risk reduction measures.
my friend has been coughing blood and having chest pains. does it mean she has breast cancer? she even loses her breath.
hi harold theses are not symptoms of breast cancer. if she is a teenager it is unlikely to be cancer but she should be seen asap. it could be an infection that needs to be treated. she should see her doctor or go to the er for an evaluation. thank you.
my friend has been coughing blood and having chest pains. does it mean she has breast cancer? she even loses her breath.
these symptoms are not likely due to breast cancer. depending upon age symptoms most likely due to infection or a blood clot. lung cancer can also cause these symptoms. these are potentially serious symptoms and your friend should see a physician or primary care provider.
my friend has been coughing blood and having chest pains. does it mean she has breast cancer? she even loses her breath.
the symptoms you described and pain in the chest is a serious medical condition. especially chest pains is always a red flag and appointment with your pcp is warranted. rec. : see your pcp for further investigation or referral to cardiologist. if concerned do not hesitate to go to urgent care or er. take care.
my friend has been coughing blood and having chest pains. does it mean she has breast cancer? she even loses her breath.
have your friend see a doc could be anything including cancer but that's lowest on the list.
my mom had breast cancer my grand father had collon cancer my grandmother had lung cancer i had leukemia when should i start testing for the others?
hi tiffany sorry to hear ab what you/your family went through. you need to see a genetic counselor. most large cancer centers have one. they will do a blood test or a mouth swab to check for cancer genes. li fraumeni syndrome (and others) need to be ruled-out. when you start testing depends on the age your relatives were when diagnosed/what gene (if any) you have. please stop smoking. good luck!
my mom used to have breast cancer few years ago she had surgery chemo radio and now hormonal. she is now feeling itchy inside her arm and swelling?
likely lymphedema. could be breast cancer recurrence. see oncologist for imaging and physical examination. if lymphedema see a lymphedema specialist.
my mom used to have breast cancer few years ago she had surgery chemo radio and now hormonal. she is now feeling itchy inside her arm and swelling?
is this the arm on the side of the surgery and radiation? were the lymph nodes removed? swelling of the arm (lymphedema) can occur years after treatment and can be managed with physical therapy and a sleeve. however a recurrence of the cancer in the axilla (under the arm) should be ruled out in any patient who develops lymphedema years after treatment.
my sisrong with her bonter had a breast cancer 2 years ago. in her lat routine check alp level is 163. does that level is an idication for something?
a lot of reasons for an elevated alkaline phosphotase. these include liver problems medications bone related disorders. however in a patient with breast cancer it needs to be evaluated. hope this helps.
my wife breast cancer 55 years. going chemo. do ladies loose interest in sex at this stage. is it possible that she may be motivated to restart sexual?
libido takes a back seat to fighting for survival. eats give her some room to deal with the cancer and the emotions that come with that first.
my breasts are swelled up & hv been hurting for a few days. my period is due in 3days. history of breast cancer in family. do i need to worry about this?
this is likely your period coming on or could you be pregnant? wait and see if you have period and if situation improves. if not better soon see your doc for check. be well.
my mother in law is 76 has metastatic breast cancer in liver on chemo now started giving things away. bad sign?
your mom's physicians have presumably explained to her that her cancer is not curable and that the amount of time that she has left is unpredictable. it seems perfectly sensible and the right thing in this situation for her to share the things she has treasured with the people she loves. perhaps you can help mom prepare for what will eventually come by cherishing the times you've shared.
my mother in law is 76 has metastatic breast cancer in liver on chemo now started giving things away. bad sign?
to my knowledge there is no direct correlation of this type of behavior to the cancer prognosis. this can also be seen in elderly people without cancer. metastatic breast cancer with liver mets generally has unfavorable prognosis. but chemo does prolong the life and improve the quality of life. hope she does well with chemo.
my friend has recently had breast reconstruction surgery after breast cancer and she was wondering if it is possible to still breast feed?
if she and a mastectomy most (97%) of her breast tissue was removed and she won't be able to breastfeed on that side even if she had reconstruction. breast reconstruction uses an implant or the patient's own tissue (flap) to replace the tissue removed by mastectomy. however the reconstructed breast cannot produce milk. if she kept her other breast she will be able to breastfeed on that side.
my friend has recently had breast reconstruction surgery after breast cancer and she was wondering if it is possible to still breast feed?
the original surgery or the reconstruction may or may not have interfered with the internal structures needed to make or transfer milk from the glands forward to the nipple if so breast feeding would not be possible. if they did not it might be. the surgeons involved might be able to answer the question with more reliability.
my friend has recently had breast reconstruction surgery after breast cancer and she was wondering if it is possible to still breast feed?
yes she may be able tobreastfeed
my mom had lobular breast cancer at 54 and her paternal cousin had breast cancer at 48. everyone is brca negative. is this likely hereditary?
without more info. brca 1 and 2 are not the only genes known to increase the risk for cancer and there are probably others we do not know anything about. someone in the family (preferably your mom or her cousin) should visit a genetic counselor (if they have not yet done so) to see what other genes need to be tested if necessary and what else they can do to reduce their risk.
my fourteen year old daughter fears she might have breast cancer. my sister says she is too young to have it is she correct?
it is very very rare to have breast cancer so young. i recommend you take her to a breast specialist or her pediatrician. the bigger concern is why is she having these ideas at this age: is there someone close to her that has breast cancer? did she hear someone talking at school? it is important to find out or have your pediatrician speak with her. see my others posts on breast pain/fibrocystic
my fourteen year old daughter fears she might have breast cancer. my sister says she is too young to have it is she correct?
hormonal influence is most common cause of breast pain in a teen. an ultrasound can provide reassurance and check for cysts or other benign non cancerous growth
my mom's paternal uncle had aml at 65 and his daughter had it at 53. my mom's father had colon cancer at 87 and she had breast cancer at 54. genetic?
cancer is a disease of the genes yet most people get cancer unpredictably. breast cancer does run in families more often than other cancers. so if your mother has had it you are at some risk too. you should be alert and watchful. learn to do a breast self examination once monthly. looking for any lumps and also get an annual clinical breast examination done by your doctor. mammography comes lat
pills for breast augmentation work?
the use of hormones for male to female trangenders is well accepted. there use in women is considerably more controversial due to the potential risk of promoting breast cancer. in fact hoone blocking drugs are commonly used to treat women with breast cancer to limit growth. other homeopathic drugs have been used but their effectiveness and safety is not accepted nor verified.
prognosis stage 3 breast cancer?
stage 3 means the tumor is large and/or the cancer has spread to many lymph nodes. it can still be cured with a combination of surgery chemotherapy and radiation therapy. the risk of cancer returning depends on many factors-- age # of involved lymph nodes and whether the cancer has hormone receptors or her2. about 50% of stage 3 breast cancer patients are cured. have hope!
prognosis stage 3 breast cancer?
a lot of different factors are used to predict prognosis in breast cancer and stage is one. grade (how similar or different from normal breast tissue) can impact. also hormonal sensitivity (er/pr status) and her2 status. for er+ oncotype dx testing gives additional biologic information to predict prognosis. computer models (ie. adjuvant online) can also help with prediction.
per my blood work my estrogen level is 7. i got a prscriptn for divigel but my mom had breast cancer 3 yrs ago. pls advs. currently in great health for 51. black female straight otr cdl driver. hysterectomy 4 yrs ago for fibroids. i get a physica
i share your concerns. i do not know what symptoms you are having that you were prescribed divigel for but i assume that you are having menopausal symptoms that you are suffering from. my concern with you would be your family history of breast cancer. in addition there is increased cardiovascular risks in women over 50 and in women who are overweight. i am very concerned that you could have consequences from taking this medication so please discuss your risk factors with your doctor. my concern with herbal medications is that they carry the same risk with their estrogen-like substances as regular estrogen so the herbal medication or bio-identicals have not been proven safe in large peer-reviewed studies either. there are other non-hormonal medications that can help menopausal symptoms such as neurontin (gabapentin) but there are several others that you can read about or ask your doctor about as well.

hi lori - based on my review of many studies on hormone-replacement therapy i do not think you are at increased risk of breast cancer from using the divigel. that product is transdermal estradiol and if it is relieving menopausal symptoms then you are getting that benefit without the cardiovascular risk shown to be increased with oral estrogen products. also your bone density benefits from estrogen therapy. there are also many large studies in peer-reviewed medical journals that show greater safety of bioidentical forms of estrogen and progesterone. there are quite a few alternatives to divigel but a full discussion is outside the scope of this forum. there are many doctors with specialty training in bioidentical hormone therapy. one resource is the web site of the medical group i work for where you will find many of the studies i am referring to in this reply: www. holtorfmed. com. due to all of your family history including that of your grandmother who died of ovarian cancer you have other factors that need addressing for a full evaluation and treatment program tailored to your individual needs.
pink is the official color for breast cancer in women what color ribbon is it for men?
i don't know of an official ribbon for male breast cancer. many organizations use a ribbon with 1/2 pink and 1/2 blue. i refer you to an organization called men against breast cancer.
possible to get breast implants tissue expansion or a musculocutaneous flap procedure at 50?
these procedures are used daily for breast reconstruction. since breast cancer is more common over age 50 the procedures are frequently performed in this age group and higher. the determining factor is your health rather than you age. see a board certified plastic surgeon for an opinion.
possible to get breast implants tissue expansion or a musculocutaneous flap procedure at 50?
the decision will depend on a thorough history and physical as well as a review of your desires expectation lifestyle and several other factors. i assume that you have had breast cancer. consultation with your oncologist general surgeon and/or radiation therapist may be recommended or involved in the decision making process.
please describe the medication: tamoxifen?
treats advanced breast cancer in men and women and early breast cancer in women. also may prevent breast cancer in women who are at a high risk because of age family history or other factors.
please describe the medication: evista (raloxifene)?
e vista (raloxifene) is a selective estrogen receptor modulator used for osteoporosis and breast cancer prevention. <link>
please describe the medication: raloxifene?
the medication is a selective estrogen receptor modulator (serm). the medication is used in menopausal patients to address the issue of osteoporosis or brittle bones. it also is used for invasive breast cancer risk reduction.
pain on my left nipple but only when i touch it. i'm a guy. could it be breast cancer?
gynecomastia can be common benign related to medication smoking marijuana or a sign of another cancer (testis) so you need to be examined. breast cancer in men is possible but not the most common for a painful breast/nipple enlargement. go get checked out.
pain on my left nipple but only when i touch it. i'm a guy. could it be breast cancer?
male breast cancer is rare and usually occurs after age 65. male breast nipple discomfort is most likely a benign condition like gynecomastia. but need to see a doctor for a physical examination to be sure.
please suggest what ideas for breast cancer awareness month do you have?
when i was in med school i was the only guy i knew who always discussed breast self-exam with women. i'd urge women starting in their teens to continue doing this and doing it right -- and not to get complacent because of all those mammogram manufacturers sponsoring pink ribbon campaigns. the physical exam still key to medicine & the fatal breast ca's i've seen could have been caught early.
please suggest what ideas for breast cancer awareness month do you have?
get a yearly mammogram and breast examination by your family physician. monthly self-examination is a good idea too. never wait if you feel a new lump or one that has not been previously evaluated by your doctor. these guidelines are endorsed by all the major medical societies despite the misguided and confising usptf guidelines issued a few years ago.
an 18 year old had three abdominal cts. is it possible for an 18 year old male with no family history or risk factors other than vitamin d defficiency to get breast cancer?
if he's got a lump / lumps i'm betting he has gynecomastia. a quick trip to the surgeon will give diagnosis and if he wishes cure.
an 18 year old had three abdominal cts. is it possible for an 18 year old male with no family history or risk factors other than vitamin d defficiency to get breast cancer?
never say never but in this case i'm as close to saying never as i've ever been. the kosher answer would be "possible but incredibly unlikely". if you truly have a medical problem follow your doc's advise and best to you. otherwise my friend get that stuff out of your head and live your life. worrying like that will not add a day to your life.
an 18 year old had three abdominal cts. is it possible for an 18 year old male with no family history or risk factors other than vitamin d defficiency to get breast cancer?
it would be rare to have it so young. but yes men get breast cancer too. for every 99 women with breast cancer there is one male. have you been diagnosed? or just worried?
are root canals linked to breast cancer?
there is no valid scientific evidence linking root canal-treated teeth and breast cancer.
are root canals linked to breast cancer?
i've looked at these claims. a couple of high-profile "independent medical thinkers" are advancing this idea for some reason. the "theory" involves either mystical "body meridians" or the implausable idea that bacteria might form on the foreign body and somehow mutate genes. i ran a search of the nih database and found nothing from the research piranhas & concluded it's baseless scare-stuff.
are root canals linked to breast cancer?
there is no correlation.

a woman was diagnosed as breast cancer that metastasized to the peritoneum she's takin chemotherapy will it be effective she's over 70 no mastectomy.
this depends on the type of breast cancer how extensive it is and how effective the chemotherapy agent is for that cancer. for example tamoxifen is a chemotherapy drug that's used on breast cancers that are positive for estrogen receptors and is very effective for them. this tumor has penetrated the chest wall so it's high stage (iiib or more) but if no metastasis has a decent (44%) chance.
a woman was diagnosed as breast cancer that metastasized to the peritoneum she's takin chemotherapy will it be effective she's over 70 no mastectomy.
breast cancer has good treatments available even for advanced stage. there are several hormone type of treatments as well as many chemotherapy drugs which can be used. it takes 2 months to determine if a drug is effective or not. if one does not work it can be switched over to another set of new drugs as needed.
am i at a high risk for if breast cancer runs in my family?
cancer risk factors include: being female increasing age genetics family history of breast cancer previous breast cancer being caucasian dense breast tissue some previous benign breast conditions never having given birth or 1st child after age 30 early menarche late menopause radiation (chest) exposure to diethylstilbestrol hormone replacement after menopause oral contraceptives >
am i at a high risk for if breast cancer runs in my family?
most women diagnosed with breast cancer do not have a fam hist. with your history genetic counseling & testing must be considered to educate you & your family/children consider earlier screening & screening for other cancer as well.
after a breast cancer diagnosis how long before the operation and/or treatment can start?
this is a very common question and concern. it is highly variable. the tendency (for obvious reasons) is for most patients to want surgery/therapy immediately. however one of the most important aspects of proper mgmt is to completely evaluate and stage the cancer. which can prolong surgery/therapy a month or more. while unsettling this has proven to ultimately improve the long term results.
at what age can you get breast cancer?
there is unfortunately no lower age cut off for breast cancer. it can occur in the very young as well as in the mature and elderly. typically the risk increases with age and screening for breast cancer for women of average risk begins at age 40. in my 23 yrs of practice my youngest patient was 19 and oldest 92 but i have colleagues who have seen it even younger than that.
after a lumpectomy for stage 1 breast cancer will a doctor always assign that you get radiation treatment or does it depend on the patient?
most of the time rdiation treatment is needed to provide comparable longterm survival benefit in comparison to mastectomy. in women over 70 years old and if the cancer is esterogen receptor positive endocrine therapy may be substitued with satisfactory results. you need to talk with your surgeon medical oncologist as well a radiation oncologist to see what your particular cirmumstance will be.
after a lumpectomy for stage 1 breast cancer will a doctor always assign that you get radiation treatment or does it depend on the patient?
trials have shown that lumpectomy folllowed by radiation for early stage breast cancer is equivalent to mastectomy. all women benefit from an improvement in local control that is preventing the cancer from coming back in the breast. women younger than 70-75 also are likely to live long enough to see a survival advantage after radiation therapy as well.
are there any breast enhancement pills that actually work?
hormones ----notice the effect of pregnancy-----stimulate breast tissue. obesity often does it as fat causes increased estrogen as well as fat deposits. but do you want to be fat(ter)? do you want to increase risks for blood clots? for breast cancer? go to a nude beach & notice how women with small breasts are the sexiest. don't fall for some scam on the radio or internet. you will regret it.
are there any signs/symptoms for breast cancer?
a lump in the breast or under thr armpit is usually the irst sign. there may also be skin changes or nipple changes or discharge. however many cancers do not present with symptoms till a later stage which is why mammography is recomended as a screening tool.
are there any signs/symptoms for breast cancer?
can be a painless mass or most likely diagnosed on mammography.
after completion of 6 cycles of chemo and mastectomy for early stage triple neg invasive carsinoma how to know there is no more cancer cells in body?
your oncologist can address this question better. although there is no reliable test for detecting residual breast cancer cells in the body there are many ways doctors monitor for any future recurrence. the response to chemotherapy given before mastectomy can guide you and your doctor. the prognosis is based on stage of the tumor and also if the tumor responded to chemotherapy in case they could.
a friend was told to freeze her ovaries or ovarian tissue before her chemotherapy (for breast cancer) is this a common practice or still experimental?
this is a great option for women interested in having children. your oncologist should send you to a infertility specialist who can work with your oncology team. care can be coordinated so that treatment can begin while eggs are harvested.
a friend was told to freeze her ovaries or ovarian tissue before her chemotherapy (for breast cancer) is this a common practice or still experimental?
yes this is common for women of child bearing age who wish to have children in the future because chemotherapy can affect the ovaries and make a woman infertile.
after having chemo and radiation for breast cancer would your hair come in different textures?
it is not uncommon for hair to regrow more curly and a different texture after chemotherapy. i have seen some pretty amazing changes. nothing to worry about. think of it as chance to be different.
am 39years old. past 1 week my left breast pains when i lie down. pain lasts fr few seconds. is there symptom for breastcancer?
breast cancer does not present with pain especially not the type of pain you are describing. i assume you are doing regular self exams. is pain premenstrual? do antacids or otc stomach medicines like prilosec help? does pain only come on when resting flat? see your provider to sort this out. without history & exam it is hard to give further advice.

are there any specific food to take and to avoid while in chemotherapy for breast cancer in stage 3. age is 60 yrs and vegetarian.
it depends on which drugs you are getting. each drug has a slightly different effect on taste. in general you should maintain your nutrition. plant based diet has been suggested to reduce the risk of recurrent disease.
are there any specific food to take and to avoid while in chemotherapy for breast cancer in stage 3. age is 60 yrs and vegetarian.
if your cancer has the estrogen receptor some oncologists advise avoiding soy wild yam red clover and other phytoestrogens. there is conflicting evidence that these can cause breast cancer cells to grow more quickly. i advise patients not to add soy supplementation but i think it's ok to continue eating soy if it's part of your baseline diet especially if you're vegetarian.
at what age should you be screened for breast cancer or cervical cancer if grandmother and aunt had each at early age in 30s/40s? brca testing? ;
early age breast cancer might signal an inherited gene mutation such as the brca1 or brca2 gene for which screening would begin around the age of 25. see a geneticist to assess risk for an inherited cancer syndrome. cervical cancer screening begins by age 21. family history may be a sign of shared environmental or lifestyle factors but inherited risk unlikely; tell your gyn the family history.
at what age should you be screened for breast cancer or cervical cancer if grandmother and aunt had each at early age in 30s/40s? brca testing? ;
cervical cancer is mostly related to hpv virus you get your paps as any other woman starting around 21. you should talk to a genetic counselor to get a good family history and probably get tested for brca and other high risk genes. even if negative and depending on the circumstances you may be considered high risk and be a candidate for enhanced screening or risk reduction manipulations.
at what age should you be screened for breast cancer or cervical cancer if grandmother and aunt had each at early age in 30s/40s? brca testing? ;
you've had sex so you should have yearly pap smears to detect cervical cancer. (this is not related to brca. ) if your aunt and grandmother are on the same side of your family and they both had breast cancer you may meet criteria for brca testing. genetic counseling is the next step. you don't need mammograms until 40 (unless you have a mutation) but do breast self-exam monthly!
at what age should you be screened for breast cancer or cervical cancer if grandmother and aunt had each at early age in 30s/40s? brca testing? ;
the pap smear is the standard screening test for cercival dysplasia/cancer. you should have routine pap smears starting when you first became sexually active. mammograms are effective screening tools especially as women age they are not effective for younger women with dense breasts. speak with a genetic councilor about brca testing. sounds to me like you should be tested.
anyone tried turmeric powder for breast cancer? does it help?
there are some claims made that turmeric might prevent development of cancer. but once you have cancer already applying turmeric powder is unlikely to do much good. it has some antiinflammatory effects but cancer needs more treatment than just some simply remedy like turmeric!
are there any funds that support breast cancer?
the susan g. komen fund is the most well-known but there are others <link> komen. org/.
at 82 and having breast cancer what are my odds of survival?
whatever your age the odds of surviving breast cancer overall are good! the majority of women survive breast cancer. what matters more than your age is your type of breast cancer and the stage at diagnosis. if you have stage i cancer your odds of dying from breast cancer are very low. it's more likely you will die from something else. but please ask your doctor this question!

are there negative effects of breast cancer treatment/ mammography after a year? what should i expect?
treatment effects can vary significantly depending on what is done (type of surgery radiation chemo). mammography should not have any significant effects especially after one year. mammograms are low dose radiation but any radiation can increase cancer risk over the long term (decades). the cancer risk from mammograms is extremely low. note that you are below the recommended screening age.
are saline breast implants safe?
breast implants like any other surgical procedure should be performed by an experienced individual in a patient who has been informed of the risks alternatives and benefits. implants require care and maintenance including regular follow ups and routine breast cancer screening as in any other female. other alternatives such as fat transfer do exist and may be considered as alternatives.

after breast reconstruction is there feeling in the nipple?
there are many different approaches to breast cancer and reconstruction surgery. maintaining function and normal appearance is important but the first priority is to properly treat the cancer. this may require surgery close to or directly involving the nipple which of course can lead to loss of sensation. if the cancer is small and remote from the nipple then nipple preservation is possible.

however may i politely remind you that if you are overweight by any chance as suggested by the presence of a lipoma you have a much higher risk of breast cancer recurrence. to eat healthy see my blog at www. mdprevent. blogspot. com.
am a breast cancer surv now l/ quadrant ab sono: 'numerous benign appearing lipoma'. they are fast growing bothersome - 5mths. should i ask for biopsy?
lipomas in general are not cancerous. there are rare cancerous lipomas. what i would suggest is serial monitoring within ultra sound like every 2 to 4 months. if it is growing yes obviously needs to be biopsied.
are there is risks of smoking 6 years after beating stage two breast cancer?
there are always risks from smoking and no one should start under any circumstance. there is probably no single factor in life (except possibly overeating) that is more directly related to adverse health than cigarette smoking. you have already had one common cancer why increase your risk of a more common one?
are kidney cancer cells different from breast cancer cells and lung cancer cells?
these 3 different cancers are actually quite different. under the microscope they look different and the types of mutations they have are also different. as a result the way the different cancers are treated are also different. generally speaking for kidney cancer they would use targeted therapies or immunotherapies instead of chemotherapy or hormone therapy.
are kidney cancer cells different from breast cancer cells and lung cancer cells?
all three can be classified as adenocarcinoma but each has characteristics which let them be identified by the organ of origin.
any ideas why i would be running fevers after finishing chemo for breast cancer in nov? i ran a fever at night for 10+ days in early dec & again now.
by now your blood counts should be normal ( have they been checked? ). also how high is the fever? any associated symptom? any new medication? you need a full physical to try to disclose the source of that fever may have nothing to do with your cancer or the chemo but it certainly needs an evaluation.
are there any biochemical tests to confirm breast carcinoma apart from clinical examination.
to confirm breast cancer is by biopsy only examination is for clinical diagnosis only confirmation is by tissue examination ( pathology ) biochemical tests tumor markers is for monitoring purposes only.
are there any biochemical tests to confirm breast carcinoma apart from clinical examination.
biochemical screens are of no value in this situation. if someone has told you otherwise they are deceived or lying. if you have a suspicious mass it needs to be biopsied. i hope things work out for you -- the vast majority of breast cancers caught early are cured nowadays.
are there any biochemical tests to confirm breast carcinoma apart from clinical examination.
clinical exam is part of the diagnosis process. but final confirmation is done with a biopsy and microscopic examination. there are special tests done to further classify the type of breast cancer; these iclude er/pgr and her2 testing.

i would not recommend obtaining a ca-125 as it is a nonspecific test in patients without ovarian cancer. i would recommend a gynecologic exam. at your age i would recommend a yearly breast exam. i would start obtaining mammograms at age 40. hope this helps.
am 32 - no children yet. best way to determine 1. ovarian cancer-pap smear or ca 125 & 2. breast cancer-mammography or ca 15-3 granny died of ovarian ca?
there is no tumor marker test to detect early breast ; ovarian cancer those you mentioned for monitoring status purposes only in a genetic pre disposition several members will suffer don't worry at 32 have healthy life style no smoking exercises wt control ; see your gyn doctor regularly get pap sonograms if indicated mamo after 40 you will be fine
at what mm of uterine lining would a doctor order a uterine biopsy? premenopausal recent diagnosis breast cancer with periods stopped for 3 months.
if a woman over the age of 40 comes in with abnormal bleeding or any abnormality of the uterine lining then they deserve an endometrial biopsy. breast cancer is often treated with tamoxifen which is associated with pre-cancerous and cancerous changes in the uterus. it sounds like they must have good reason to recommend this test.

low calcium should be corrected and then zometa should be continued. use vitamin d with calcium as well.
breast cancer bone mets. doctors cancelled mom's zometa therapy due to continuously low calcium. can they increase ca just prior infusion and after?
low calcium is not a big issue if it it is asymptomatic. the symptoms are muscle cramps in hands and feet. if she does not have this problem then zometa can be continued. but if she has already received zometa for more than 6 months it can be left out of the treatment unless she has very extensive involvement of the bones(many bones affected). calcium can be given iv but only if she has symptoms.

breast biopsy revealed fibroadenoma in oct 2011 - another lump developed seemingly as result of biopsy. hematoma? family history of bc on both sides.
it could be a hematoma if it appeared within the first week. if later it is probably scar tissue from the surgery. this scar tissue usually resolves over 6 months to a year. the familial history of breast cancer requires vigilance on the part of patient and physician.
breast biopsy revealed fibroadenoma in oct 2011 - another lump developed seemingly as result of biopsy. hematoma? family history of bc on both sides.
cutting needle core biopsy can cause internal bleeding at the site of biopsy; this is common and causes a lump that shrinks slowly and turns into fibrous scar over time. if it starts out large the lump can be permanent. on the other hand cancer can occur so vigilance is important. at age 24 breast cancer is very very rare but as you get older screening will become more important.
breast cancer symptoms?
proper screening with self breast exams looking for new lumps breast exams by your physician looking for skin or nipple chanes as well as masses or lymph nodes and mammogram and ultrasound if needed are the best ways to pick up early stage breast cancer before it causes any symptoms. once advanced it can cause many different symptoms throughout the body.

breast cancer and i am planning on breastfeeding could i still get a mammogram if my breast are full of milk?
changes in the breasts make them more dense and therefore limit the value of mammography. for screening purposes waiting 4-6 months after stopping breastfeeding will allow the breasts to return to their baseline state. if you have a lump see your doctor. if you end up needing a mammo for diagnostic purposes you can pump the breasts beforehand.
breast cancer and i am planning on breastfeeding could i still get a mammogram if my breast are full of milk?
not a good time to do mammogram while breast feeding. first the breast is engorged and full of cysts. second the radiation will be passed into the baby.
breast cancer:mastectomy done;1/12 affedctes nodes; positive hormonal receiver; score0;stage 2; is there a possibility to have a breast cancer again?
while a mastectomy will decrease your risk of breast cancer recurring it does not make it 0%. it important to have regular follow up visits with your medical oncologist and surgical oncologist.
brast cancer and mastectomy;1/12 affected node;6sessions chimio;5weeks radio;5years tamoxifen. what do you think abt this situation?

breast cancer in 2004. estrogen+. 2 nodes involved. stage 2. just had memmo ultra f nodule looks benign like intramammory lymph node. take it out?
if it's a change from last years mammogram should investigate further and consider biopsy. mri might be a good next step.
breast cancer is so rampant that i believe mammograms are the causation. where could i verify this information?
your answer is right here--do the math. the radiation exposure of a digital mammogram is 3. 7mgy. this is associated with a lifetime-attributable risk of breast cancer of 1. 3 cases per 100 000. the lifetime incidence of breast cancer in us women is 1:8. mammography is a safe proven technique for finding cancers well before they are palpable and there is no controversy about its use after age 50.
breast cancer is so rampant that i believe mammograms are the causation. where could i verify this information?
unfortunately this is not true so you cannot verify. like many diseases breast cancer appears to be more prevalent because mammograms as well as awareness is increasing the rate at which we are diagnosing cancers.
breast cancer is so rampant that i believe mammograms are the causation. where could i verify this information?
think. if what you are saying is true more women who have mammograms would die of breast cancer than women who have not had mammograms. no one's dumb enough to claim this. the actual increase in breast cancer is due mostly to women living longer and foregoing motherhood / lactation. you're an adult and are smart enough to have found healthtap; don't be a sucker for obviously-false web claims.
breast cancer with chemo. should i eat organic or all natural chicken and turkey. some say no hormones and atb some just say no hormones. i'm confused?
wish you the best with your tumor. having cancer is bad enough without everybody offering their well-intentioned imaginative and sub-scientific thoughts. especially remember that while your physician is bound by law to tell you the truth as best we can determine by the methods of science any crook can set up a "natural / spiritual / wellness" website to try to scare you / sell you something.
breast cancer with chemo. should i eat organic or all natural chicken and turkey. some say no hormones and atb some just say no hormones. i'm confused?
"all natural" can mean a lot of things. organic means the animal also ate organic feed. if you are so inclined to more natural eating go with hormone free and antibiotic free. i do see that you marked that you smoke - this is a proven health risk in terms of cancer i suggest you focus on this primarily.

bilateral nipple discharge with stimulation cytology was negative no lump or mass seen on u/s. is this accurate test for breast cancer?
cytology is not a great test to rule out cancer in the case of nipple discharge. ultrasound is a good test but also doesn't rule out cancer. however bilateral discharge only with stimulation is extremely unlikely to represent cancer especially at your age. unilateral spontaneous discharge is more concerning as is bloody nipple discharge.
bilateral nipple discharge with stimulation cytology was negative no lump or mass seen on u/s. is this accurate test for breast cancer?
one must differentiate pathologic discharge from physiologic secretion. the latter tends to be bilateral & non-spontaneous & originating from multiple terminal ducts. considering your symptoms age normal cytology and normal ultrasound observation alone is appropriate.
breast cancer is genetic and not hereditary is that correct?
it's easy to misunderstand. genetic disease is usually hereditary -- only a few diseases of genes can't be inherited or passed on; new mutations are genetic but not hereditary. inherited disease is almost always genetic. a variety of genes may be passed parent-to-child each defining a "cancer family syndrome" but most cancer is sporadic.
breast cancer chemotherapy in hepatitis b patients?
appropriate involvement of hepatologist and treatment (or prophylaxis) of hep b is imperative.
breast cancer chemotherapy in hepatitis b patients?
i am not sure we can offer much here. the various chemotherapy regimens are not noted here; nor is the hepatitis status and what treatment you are on if you have active hepatitis b or are inactive. i would believe that you should be able to have full treatment regardless especially if your hepatitis b is being treated appropriately.

breast cancer in young women under 30 what are the chances?
breast cancer is usually a disease of postmenopausal women so the chances of having cancer before 30 are low. that said certain personal and family risk factors can increase the chances of cancer even in young women so i suggest you visit your doctor to discuss your current cancer risk and the potential need for early screenings or surveillance.
breast lump in a 16 year old female could this be cancer?
although possible breast cancer is rare in premenopausal women and it is extremely extremely rare in teenagers. more likely the lump is some active breast tissue in the maturing breast or a benign mass such as a fibroadenoma or fibrocystic disease. for reassurance you should see your primary care physician; if he/she is concerned referral to a general surgeon would be in order.
can you tell me how to know if i am at risk for breast cancer?
we really don't know what causes breast cancer. we do know that women with a long exposure to estrogen are at a higher risk. if you started your period early or never got pregnant or have a family history of breast cancer your risk is higher. radiation exposure to the chest wall (from cancer treatment) increases your risk. alcohol intake increases your risk. so does aging. we're all at risk!
can you tell me how is breast cancer hormone dependent?
breast cancer cells have receptors on the surface. you can think of these like light switches. most breast cancers have receptors for estrogen or progesterone the female hormones. these hormones can bind to the receptor turning it on and telling the cancer cell to grow. often the treatment for breast cancer involves blocking these hormone or the receptors they bind to. i hope that helps!
can you tell me how has the treatment of breast cancer changed over the years?
over the last few decades many things have changed: taxanes as part of the chemo plan is established for lymph node-positive disease. herceptin was approved for her2+ breast cancer. pertuzumab was approved for her2+ breast cancer when given before surgery. lumpectomy and radiation are alternative to mastectomy in many patients. radiation is more focused allowing less toxicity.
can you tell me about hormone receptive metastic breast cancer?
this means that the cancer has spread from the breast to other areas of the body ( bone lung liver etc. )-stage. it is a tumor that should respond to chemotherapy and hormone therapy. hormone therapy is a blocker-it blocks the tumor cell from being able to feed off of estrogen which causes its growth. the hormone therapy should stop the tumor from growing.
could a doctor please give me an alternative treatment for evista (raloxifene)?
if taking it for bone density alternatives are a bisphosphonate (fosamax boniva (ibandronate) actonel etc) miacalcin nasal spray or a rank-ligand inhibitor (prolia). if you are taking it for breast cancer prevention alternatives are (assuming the person taking it is postmenopausal) aromasin and tamoxifen.
can endocrine disrupting chemicals cause breast cancer? is it likely or merely myth?
i've been watching these claims for two decades. fearmongers have produced a huge literature in which everything synthetic is bad for you especially as "endocrine disruptors" while all natural vegetable products are healthy. despite the dark conspiracy talk it's almost all junk science (correlations huge doses of chemicals on cells / animals) & mainstream scientists ignore it.
can endocrine disrupting chemicals cause breast cancer? is it likely or merely myth?
of your questions please elaborate

can you tell me about estrogen and progesterone positive her 2 positive - chance of being brca?
her2 positive means a protein in breast cancer cells promote cancer in breast and non breast tissues. you could inherit the bad cancer gene. this is an aggressive breast cancer. the standard chemo are not effective. new drugs are effective. estrogen & progesterone are female hormones but estrogen is more involved. chances are strong for her2+ females to get cancer.
can you give me some suggestions on supporting girlfriend through double mastectomy?
go to office visits and help take notes and ask questions. help her after surgery with meals errands. be loving and positive. do something fun so she can take her mind off the overwhelming process. encourage her to attend a breast cancer support group.
could reusing water bottles cause breast cancer?
plastic bottles can contain bpa which are aromatic compounds that can potentially promote dna damage and theoretically raise cancer risk although this is hard to quantify. while any kind of cancer has environmental and genetic components there is no direct evidence that reusing water bottles will cause breast cancer. if you have anxiety about this consider using glass bottles.
can a 12 year old girl get breast cancer?
i am not going to say "never" but the incidence is close to that. anytime there is breast tissue present there is a theoretical risk of breast cancer. however lumpy breast tissue is an early adolescent is so much likely to be something else - most commonly fibrous breast tissue. if there is extreme worry a simple ultrasound could set mind at ease but it is probably overdoing it!
can a 12 year old girl get breast cancer?
primary breast cancer is rare before age 25 yrs. when breast cancer is seen in an adolescent it is frequently caused by spread from another site in the body or from structures within the breast such as tumors of blood vessels. however onset of periods before 12 yrs and prior radiation treatment near breasts is linked to adult breast cancer in teens. consult your child's doctor if a mass is felt.
can i get most of my breast tissue removed when i get implants? or do they not do that?
there is no good medical reason to remove breast tissue while getting implants. tissue is usually removed for cosmetic reason such as a lift. if you are worried about breast cancer prevention removing most of your natural breast tissue would probably be of little use since residual breast tissue could still become diseased especially if you have a brca gene. best of luck hope this helps.
can i take bc pill even if i have a history of breast cancer in my family? (mother passed away and grandmother survived)
were the family breast cancers estrogen receptor positive? if so the pills do contain a very small amount of estrogen and your psyche may best be treated with another form of secure contraception. talk to your md about this subject and options.
can you tell me is having a prophylactic mastectomy a good idea?
prophylactic mastectomy does not improve recurrence or survival from breast cancer. the risk generally of a new contralateral breast cancer is only 1%/year. we generally do not recommend unless circumstances like brca mutation exist.
could they remove the pectoral musle in a voluntary mastectomy?
this procedure of removing the muscle is not considered standard. if there is muscle involvement then you need chemotherapy before surgery. i recommend you ask more questions and consider finding a breast center to speak with a breast cancer surgeon for options. good luck!
can you tell me more about a masectomy bill trying to be passed?
a bill known as the breast cancer patient protection act seeks to require insurance companies to cover a minimum 48-hour hospital stay for patients undergoing mastectomies to prevent what is known as "in-and-out drive-through mastectomies". it was introduced by connecticut congresswoman rosa l. delauro in 2009 (hr 1691) but has failed to pass both the senate and house.

fibroadenomas? they are common benign tumors many women have multiple fibroadenomas. they are not cancerous nor do they increase the risk of cancer.
can extra fibroid in breast mean breast cancer? doctor found some and requested a sonogram
cancer. fibroids in the breast do not transform into ca. women with fibrocystic breasts do have an elevated risk toward breast ca compared to women without but that's worlds away from being able to diagnose breast ca on the basis of their presence. i am concerned however for your history of up to 7 drinks/week and i believe that signals potential bigger issues than your fibroids. plz consider.
can extra fibroid in breast mean breast cancer? doctor found some and requested a sonogram
a mass in the breast can be a sign of cancer. however fibrocystic masses in the breast are common and are benign. your sonogram will give you good information on what it could possibly be. rest easy until the sonogram results are in.
can i expect to live a few years with stage 2 breast cancer? er/ pr and her2 all posit. no node involvement but a large 3 2cm tumor grd 3. i am 29
the answer to your question is clearly "yes". you need to review the treatment and long-term outlook with your oncologist. many programs test the tumor cells for their genetic makeup to give you a better answer on the likelihood of recurrence over the long term. you are likely to receive medicine for several years to decrease the likelihood of recurrence including one for her positivity.
can i expect to live a few years with stage 2 breast cancer? er/ pr and her2 all posit. no node involvement but a large 3 2cm tumor grd 3. i am 29
do not just look at the statistics of 5 year survival for your or any cancer those are just stats you are your own statistic. every case is different the meds are changing (where the stats go back to when the newer drugs and treatments were not available) you are young and otherwise healthy so your body is strong to fight the cancer and undertake chemo/radiation/surgery unlike older person.

can breast cancer come back after surgery chemotherapy and radiation after 2 month?
i would love to say that the treatments we offer are 100% effective but that would be a lie. sadly some patients will have a relapse of their cancer regardless of what we do. all those therapies reduce the risk of recurrence but not down to 0.
can breast cancer come back after surgery chemotherapy and radiation after 2 month?
after surgery and radiation it is common to be left with a mass at the site sometimes scar tissue sometimes fluid-filled area (seroma). however it is important for your oncologist to do an exam to evauate if there is cause for concern. whatever signs/symptoms you may have should be addressed by your medical oncologist in a timely manner. good luck! i hope all turns out well!
can pregnancy induce breast cancer?
pregnancies are associated with decreased lifetime breast cancer risk.
can pregnancy induce breast cancer?
pregnancy causes many hormone changes in the body. for one thing pregnancy stops monthly menstrual cycles and shifts the hormone balance toward progesterone rather than estrogen. this is why women who become pregnant while they are young and have many pregnancies may have a slightly lower risk of breast cancer later on. they are exposed to less estrogen. women who have had no children or who had their first pregnancy after age 30 on the other hand have a slightly higher breast cancer risk.

chart reads breast cancer (hcc) (worded exactly). what does the hcc mean? is it only hepatocellular carcinoma?
it is probably a local abbreviation that means something; was it perhaps diagnosed at harvard cancer center? as eager as we are to answer this is the wrong place to bring a question like this.
can trauma to the breast cause breast cancer?
while trauma has been associated with breast and other cancers it does not lead to the development of the cancer but to noting the presence of the cancer at the site of trauma. cancer is induced by genetic changes either inherited or acquired from the environment. trauma again is unable to cause such genetic changes.
can ct scan detect breast cancer or lymphoma? having swollen axillary lymph nodes since months+ fibroadenomas+complex cyst ct scan results were normal
the enlarged lymph nodes associated with lymphoma but a biopsy is necessary to make the diagnosis. ct can occasionally pickup a breast cancer but it is generally not utilized for detecting breast cancer or evaluating breast abnormalities. mammography ultrasound and mri are more appropriate.
can ct scan detect breast cancer or lymphoma? having swollen axillary lymph nodes since months+ fibroadenomas+complex cyst ct scan results were normal
the ct can detect some masses that would then need further evaluation. mammogram and breast us may sometimes be better. it varies. how large are the axillary lymph nodes? are they large enough to biopsy? how big is the complex cyst? have you seen a surgeon about possible biopsy?
can a mastectomy be considered preventive medicine for a trans man?
preventive mastectomy might be beneficial for a female to male transexual that has a high risk of breast cancer based on personal and family history. mastectomy performed for cancer prevention would have little benefit for a male-to-female transexual since the risk of breast cancer is so low.
ct scan 2013 no nodules-2 on ct scan 10/2014 ago-ct scan 11/2014 3 nodules-all around 5 mm-diagnosed w/stage 1b breast ca 9/2013 triple+ is this mets?
with stage 1 breast cancer 9/2013 lumpectomy or partial mastectomy performed with sentinel node. . having nodules increase in number in 2014 probably axillary nodes that had not been removed at the original surgery. increasing nodes suggests disease progressing in axilla and as such should be biopsied if positive completion of axillary dissection needed. hormone therapy also needed

she may go over your breast health history for example if you have had a prior biopsy and your family history of breast cancer. she may ask when and where you had previous mammograms. also she will verify your identity.
diagnosed with shingles 5 days ago; have lymphedema on 1 arm from removal of 30 breast cancer involved lymph nodes - what if shingles spreads to arm?
good news is that shingles always follows set patterns. the outbreaks follow the course of a sensory nerve. so if the outbreak isn't now near the arm it is very unlikely that it will go there. you can search online for shingles dermatomes to see the patterns. if it does make it to your arm secondary infection is your biggest concern. be careful the blisters do not pop and become infected.

do great-aunts having breast cancer affect risk for this disease? or is it only first-degree relatives (mom sister daughter)? 2 great aunts had it.
first degree relatives have more "punch" when talking about cancer risk but it depends greatly on the composition and the size of the family. also depends on the ages at which the patients developed cancer and whether there are other types of cancer in the family. talk to your gyn or pcp maybe you need to see a professional with expertise in cancer genetics and risk assessment.
do great-aunts having breast cancer affect risk for this disease? or is it only first-degree relatives (mom sister daughter)? 2 great aunts had it.
having a first degree relative with breast cancer will increase the risk of a women getting breast cancer in their lifetime approximately 5% over the average population risk which is 12%. so in a woman your age having a first degree relative with breast cancer would increase the risk to approximately 17%. having great aunts with breast cancer would increase the risk slightly perhaps to 13%.

does nicotine promote other cancers such as breast cancer? please need some answers?
most earlier studies really couldn't tie smoking with breast cancer but some recent work looking at smoking's relationship with breast cancer found that smoking did alter some estrogen receptors in breast associated with accelerating the growth of cancer cells. alcohol is more related and the smoking addition to risk is quite modest but appears there at least in some kinds of breast cancer.
does injury to the breast cause by excessive poking and prodding cause breast cancer?
it does not.
do you have to cut your breast off to get rid of breast cancer? what do i do?
if the cancer is large relative to the size of your breast it may require a mastectomy instead of a lumpectomy. depending on the type of breast cancer if you have a large tumor and it is fast-growing you may be a good candidate for iv or oral therapy prior to surgery to shrink down the tumor. you would need to see a surgical or medical oncologist to see if this is an option for you.

for best detection which is best digital mammogram or sonogram?
mammogram remains the first choice for breast cancer screening. there is a select group of patients for whom screening ultrasound and mri breast will be added to supplement the mammogram.
for best detection which is best digital mammogram or sonogram?
mammo is the standard of care for screening. mammo is approximately 80% sensitive for detecting breast cancer. sensitivity decreases in women with dense breasts some say to as low as 40-50%. there is some data to support adding screening us as a supplement to mammography in women with dense breasts which can detect an additional 3-5 cancers per 1000 patients. false positives a problem though
family history of breast cancer when to get a mammogram and ultrasound?
if you have a first degree relative (mother or sister) who was diagnosed at age <50 then take the age at diagnosis and subtract 10 years. so if your mother was diagnosed at age 46 you would start at age 36. otherwise all women should start annual screening mammograms at age 40.
family history of breast cancer when to get a mammogram and ultrasound?
it is important to find out the ages of family members who have breast cancer. if it is a mother sister or grandmother who was diagnosed before age 50 then you may need to start 10 years prior (i. e. if mom was 42 then start at 32). it also important to have a risk assessment and find out if there is any brca mutation in the family.

family history of breast cancer. should i get brca testing?
to figure out if brca testing would be useful for you it depends on the number of individuals with breast cancer in your family the age at development of breast cancer degree of relatedness (first-degree etc. ) and history of other ancillary cancers. this type of information can determine if you are at higher risk for breast cancer and if you are then brca testing may be useful
family history of breast cancer. should i get brca testing?
talk to your doctor regarding your family risks & have a yearly breast examination. ask if there is a genetic counselor in your area to consult with.
finished breast cancer chemo 1 yr ago. hair grew back at an expected rate at first. now i have had no hair growth for over 4 months. a concern?
it has no specific meaning. i would give it some more time as the breast cancer does not affect hair growth. it is only chemotherapy and sometimes hormonal therapy which could slow down the hair growth. ask your oncologist to give you some reasonable explanation as to why you might have this problem.
finished breast cancer chemo 1 yr ago. hair grew back at an expected rate at first. now i have had no hair growth for over 4 months. a concern?

fat stem cells as an alternative to breast reconstruction surgery. what do plastic surgeons think?
stem cells show huge promise throughout the medicine including plastic surgery. unfortunately we still don't know how best to use this technology safely. breast reconstruction is a very good example. we have no long term data about the safety of stem cell use in breast cancer patients and how breast cancer recurrence rates are affected (if at all).
felt bead-like 2-3mm mass just outside areola so stopped vivelle (estradiol). after 1 wk shaped like a caplet <1mmx3mm less tender. could it be cancer or dcis?
i have been a breast cancer surgeon for over 20 years and i am still fooled by some exams. with that said there are some generalizations about which breast lumps are more concerning than others. cancers tend to be rock-hard fixed and 3-dimensionally round or oval. benign lumps tend to be rubbery cigar-shaped or pancake-shaped. what you are describing sounds benign but you must be seen.
from what i know of no one in my family have died from cancer o breast cancer but i feel a pain underneath my breast should and i am 24?
breast pain and tenderness is very common and in most cases does not indicate cancer. perform breast self exam each month. if you feel any abnormality or are concerned about the pain please see your doctor.
from what i know of no one in my family have died from cancer o breast cancer but i feel a pain underneath my breast should and i am 24?
you are unlikely to have breast cancer. if the pain persists see a physician.
from what i know of no one in my family have died from cancer o breast cancer but i feel a pain underneath my breast should and i am 24?
it's better to have it checked out. it could be pain from stomach called gerd pleurisy or costochondritis. take aleve (naproxen) twice a day for 5 days with food. it will get better. i don't think it is from breast cancer.
how effective is a lumpectomy for treating breast cancer?
on how small well differentiated and how localized breast ca is. sometimes it needs radiation treatment and sometimes adjuvant chemo therapy.
how effective is radiation therapy for treating breast cancer?
radiation plays an important role in treating breast cancer. in the neoadjuvant setting it can reduce the size of a relatively large lesion making surgery more effective. it can be used to treat micro disease in axilla and after lumpectomy can be used to enhance survival and reduce local recurrence. in metastatic bone disease it can control in not eliminate disease.
how effective is breast surgery for treating breast cancer?
surgery more effective today then in previous years because of early dx by mammo. here non palpable tumors or dcis is detected and wide resection with adequate margins free of disease can give close to 90% to 95% cure or better when rt employed if needed
how effective is breast surgery for treating breast cancer?
surgery is the primary curative treatment for most breast cancers. it can often remove all cancer cells from the body in early stages. radiation therapy can be given after a lumpectomy to give similar local control rates to a mastectomy. systemic therapy (chemotherapy biologic and hormonal therapy) can also be given in addition to surgery to address the risk of cells in the bloodstream.
how effective is anastrozole (arimidex) for treating breast cancer?
anastrozole inhibits the aromatase enzyme which in turn prevents the conversion of androgens to estrogens in peripheral tissues which is the primary source of estrogen in post-menopausal women. this is very effective and has different and potentially less side effects than tamoxifen. in pre-menopausal women the ovaries are still producing estrogen and thus these medicines will not be effective
how effective is anastrozole (arimidex) for treating breast cancer?
there are many support groups for pancreatic cancer. the biggest organization is the american cancer society but the pancan organization has lots of good information and can direct you to a group near you.
how effective is anastrozole (arimidex) for treating breast cancer?
it is a very good drug in preventing breast cancer relapse in patients who have had their breast tumors removed. prevents estrogen stimulation in patients with estrogen receptor positive breast cancer.
how effective is a radical mastectomy for treating breast cancer?
mastectomy is generally very effective however chemotherapy and radiation are sometimes recommended as well. it really depends on the type of cancer how aggressive it is and wether there has been spread to other areas or lymph nodes. in early stages mastectomy can cure 95-98% of women. your breast surgeon/oncologist can/should provide specifics based on your case.
hello shall i allways have zometa and herceptin (trastuzumab) for her 2 breast cancer bone metastasis? or is zometa with femara enough? thanks a lot
herceptin (trastuzumab) is indicated for her2-pos metastatic bc. duration of therapy in metastatic setting is not well defined. usually it continues as long as it works or discontinued due to toxicity. zometa is indicated for bone metastasis in most solid tumors. it carries a risk for osteonecrosis of jaw. usually it is stopped after 2 yrs if not earlier. femara is for post-menopausal bc who has positive er/pr.
how effective is letrozole (femara) for treating breast cancer?
depends on 1) whether the tumor is estrogen receptor positive 2) stage of the cancer. if metastatic it works better for bone and soft tissue metastases and not very well for liver and lung metastasizes. often used as an adjuvant treatment after surgery and often with radiotherapy
how effective is chemotherapy for treating breast cancer?
chemo initially started with combinations like cmf and then changed to combinations of antibody plus chemo such as taxol plus herceptin (trastuzumab). these drugs alone and in combination best used as a neoadjuvant prior to surgical resection or when at high risk in the adjuvant setting to prevent recurrence. once metastasis happens there can be chemo control but cure is rare.
how effective is docetaxel (docefrez) for treating breast cancer?
docetaxel is also called taxotere (docetaxel). it is in a group of drugs we call "taxanes". these are some of the most effective drugs to treat breast cancer. they work by inhibiting a cancer cell's microtubules. microtubules are like tiny tinker toys. they form the structure of the cell and they need to disassemble for one cell to divide into two cells. taxotere (docetaxel) prevents this process.
how long can someone live that's been diagnosed with stage 1 breast cancer on average (beyond 5 years)?
that is a difficult question. it is certainly possible. with treatment the 5 year survival rate for stage i cancer is very high. without treatment it would depend on the type of cancer how aggressive it is age and health of the patient among other things. i have seen advanced stage patient live a lot longer than expected and early stage patients die earlier. i would advise treatment.
how effective is the tac chemotherapy regimen for treating breast cancer?
tac stands for taxotere adriamycin (doxorubicin) and cyclophosphamide. it is one of the strongest regimens for treating breast cancer and some would say too strong. depending on the type of breast cancer you have or the stage you might be able to receive a gentler regimen. if you want to know more get a second opinion.
how effective is toremifene citrate for puffy nipples and gynecomastia?
1) what are you ingesting (pot cimetidine "steroids " too-numerous-to-list other drugs) that can cause gynecomastia? 2) is there a family history of breast cancer? 3) are you on cancer treatment? (if so talk to your oncologist 4) are you close to your ideal bmi? a surgical option is preferable to long-term use of hormone-related rx
hypothyroidism take 50mcg thyronorm daily. read that hrts like the above increase risk of breast cancer in long run. is this true?
the word hrt means use of female hormones(like estrogen/progesterone) for post meopausal symptoms like hot flashes etc. what you are taking has no effect on the breast only estrogens do.
how long does breast cancer take to spread if it goes untreated? are we talking months or years? or 10 years +
my rule of thumb: treatment should be initiated = 6 weeks unless it's a particularly fulminant lesion-in which case psychological burden of delay alone dictates more immediate action. the fear of cancer => stress which is immunosuppressive. do not make a final decision until you have consulted with all of these 4 specialists: oncology general surgery plastic surgery and radiation oncology.
hello my mum was nephrostomy because of breast cancer and her ureter obstacle so she is under chemioterapy. 2 days ago she did chemo i saw some white particles in her urin tub. please help me.
quite common to see flecks of tissue in nephrostomy tube urine. sorry your mum is having chemo for breast cancer. if she is making normal amount of urine she should be ok. if she can drink plenty of liquids.

your risk of lung cancer after xrt for breast cancer is only elevated if you were a smoker and continued to smoke.
hello my mum lost her sense of smell due to chemo/radiation for triple neg breast cancer will it ever come back? its been almost a year since she has finished chemo and 9 months since she finished radiation therapy. she is 54 years old. thank you
if it is going to come back we will know in the next 6-12 months. nerves heal slowly and when they heal it can take a long time. since this was a problem for a long time it may not come back at this point. it is worth being patient. are we certain it is due to the treatments? sometimes a person may lose their sense of smell for other reasons.

possible perhaps not.
have been a moderate drinker (2 drinks per day 2-3 times a wk) for 15 yrs. just read that now i have a 24% chance of getting breast cancer? panicking
alcohol does increase your risk for developing breast cancer but only slightly so there is little reason to panic. what you do need to do is improve your lifestyle to reduce the risk. you have ample time to do so. first you should cut down on alcohol and if you can stop using it or limit it to one drink only. further you should eat healthy(plant based foods) and exercise and watch your weight.
having trouble sleeping. i am taking arimedex in the morning for breast cancer. . would it be better to take at night?

how to ban breast cancer? will large breast cause it?
other than for the 5-10 % of women with genetic mutations breast cancer is derived from exogenous sources. the mmtv virus and other viruses such as ebv have a strong association. these viral infections into mucosal cells of the breast cant be controlled by diet or exposure. when the virus enters the duct epithelium it causes a transformation in wnt-1 gene regardless of breast size
how much estrogen gets into system using vaginal estrogen. family history of breast cancer but not me. ?
per the med insert: premarin (conjugated estrogens) vaginal cream should not be used if you have unusual vaginal bleeding have or had cancer had a stroke or heart attack have or had blood clots or liver problems have a bleeding disorder are allergic to any of its ingredients. this is due to significant absorption thru the vaginal mucosa which is dose dependent. not the same risk for someone with family history only

hello. my aunt's ill with breast cancer a malignant tumor. she's had 4 sessions of chemotheraphy. now she has an ulcer on her breast. is it fatal?
sound good unless she received excessive radiation therapy
has subcentimetric enlarged para aortic lymphnodes has got to do anything with the history of breast cancer or can it be related to colitis?
better discuss with pmd. . it should be seriously compared with past studies.
i have a small group of red pinprick dots on my breast. my father has genetic breast cancer. should i be worried?
given the family history of breast cancer it would be wise to schedule a consultation with your provider to perform a breast exam and mammogram if indicated but usually what you describe is likely to be a skin "rash" ( dermatitis) and not indicative of any underlying abnormality.
is always sleeping with face down can cause breast cancer?
i'm actually familiar with this silly myth which was made up out of whole cloth as an internet hoax in the 1990's militant by an anti-brassiere militant. i'm sorry anyone troubled you over this.
is always sleeping with face down can cause breast cancer?
where and how did you get or hear this concern for this question? based on my 46-year study and practice in medicine i have never heard or read about your concern on face-down sleep may cause beast cancer. physiologically positioning in sleep should not alter the arrangement of chromosome of any cells inside the body. hence the answer to this q is no; don't worry but stress healthy lifestyle.
i've read that a mammogram is useless when it comes to detecting cancer in women with dense breasts. is this true?
but this doesn't mean a mammogram is useless for detecting cancer or other breast abnormalities in women with dense breasts. breast tissue is composed of fatty (nondense) tissue and connective (dense) tissue. women with dense breasts have more connective tissue than fatty tissue. about half of women undergoing mammograms have dense breasts. dense breast tissue appears as a solid white area on a mammogram and fat appears as a dark area. mammogram x-rays do not penetrate — or "see through" — dense tissues as well as they do through fat. so in women with dense breasts mammograms may be more difficult to interpret. some studies have found that newer digital mammography does a better job detecting cancer in dense breasts than does mammography that uses film. a digital mammogram produces images on a computer screen that can be enhanced and magnified for closer viewing. most mammogram machines in the united states are digital mammogram machines. another newer breast-imaging test called 3-d mammography (breast tomosynthesis) may provide an improved way of seeing through dense breast tissue. a 3-d mammogram combines multiple low-dose mammogram images to create a 3-d image of the breast. though not available everywhere 3-d mammography is becoming more common. additional screening tests are being developed for women with dense breasts but unlike mammograms none is proved to reduce the risk of dying of breast cancer. discuss your breast cancer screening options with your doctor. together you may decide that based on your risk factors additional breast cancer screening tests may be right for you.
i've been diagnosed with early-stage breast cancer. i've heard that a gene expression profiling test might help in planning my treatment. what is it?
early-stage breast cancer is cancer that is either confined to the breast or has spread only to nearby lymph nodes but not to distant parts of the body. gene expression profiling is designed to identify people who don't need adjuvant chemotherapy so they can avoid the side effects of unnecessary treatment and for those who may benefit from adjuvant chemotherapy so they can receive it. a gene expression profiling test analyzes the patterns of a number of different genes within the your own cancer cells to help predict how likely it is that an early-stage hormone-sensitive breast cancer will recur after initial treatment. if all of the standard factors that doctors look at to predict the chance of the cancer returning are already very small then this test is probably not necessary. nor are these tests very helpful if you have an aggressive cancer in which there is clearly benefit from using chemotherapy. for people who fall between these two categories a decision needs to be made whether to use chemotherapy and these tests can be particularly helpful. the effectiveness of gene expression profiling is still being studied in a number of clinical trials. and while some doctors are using gene expression profiling to plan treatment others are waiting for the results of these studies. discuss with your doctor the pros and cons of gene expression profiling. there are a few gene expression profiling tests currently available. more tests are in development. these tests are not for people with more advanced breast cancer that has spread to distant parts of the body nor is it helpful if the cancer is not sensitive to hormones or is her2 positive. these tests can be expensive (several thousand dollars) and insurance does not always cover the cost of the test.
is secondary cancer always terminal? my nana's breast cancer has spread to her liver. how long does she have to live?
nowadays the advent of chemotherapy & the understanding of the cancer with specific cell types have brought much more good news to the cancer affected patients including breast cancer although of course metastatic cancer worsens the longevity. for your nana it would be more logical to direct this q to her medical oncologist who knows more her individual conditions than anyone online.
is there anything i can do to help my grandma who may or may not have breast cancer?
like i hope you always are. if she has a dominant mass it will need to be biopsied. encourage her to comply. offer her what comfort is right knowing her personality. different people deal with the anxiety of a workup in different ways. there is no "one size fits all" to being nice to a family member. some cultures are superstitious about this disease; you're educated and can help here.
i was told that if someone was treated for breast cancer 20yrs ago with tamoxifen that they did not carry the brca1 & brca2 mutations? is this true?
brca test is not often done unless there is strong family history of breast cancer in multiple members. this test was not available 20 years back so it would not have been done. but it is not to be done except in selected cases where we suspect it may be abnormal.
i had breast cancer 10 years ago cancer free now. my hair is dry all the time would some oil cap cell be safe and good for my hair thank you?

i have an extreme fear or getting breast cancer. i've seen therapist but can't shake this. you have any advice? i would like to have breast reduction
breast reduction will not significantly reduce your chance of getting breast cancer. if you have the gene prophylactic mastectomy may be an option. otherwise not appropriate just for fear. nothing you can do will make you immune or even reduce your risk much. you also know that proper surveillance against breast cancer drops your risk of dying of it to very low. to be brave act brave.
i found this tiny lump in my right collar bone. 6 years ago i had a mastectomy done for breast cancer d is. should i worry?
it could also be an enlarged lymph-node related to your dcis. you should have a doctor check it. it could be nothing but you can't assume this. best wishes!
i have a visible vein on my aerola for the last 11 months. no growth more visible when hot no other symptoms. family breast cancer history. ?
nothing to do with cancer. your areola is fine. you have nothing to worry about.
i'm not sure if i have breast cancer or some else. i do feel lumps in them and it kinda hurts when i touch them. so i'm scared?
breast lumps are a common problem and most are non-cancerous. i would follow up with your doctor to have your breast evaluated to rule out breast cancer as early detection is key.
i recently changed birth control and 3rd month taking it my boobs started hurting. a prickly kinda hurt. they hurt 24/7. do i have breast cancer?
it is very unlikely that you have breast cancer. if your symptoms continue you should consult your doctor for change to a different pill. for good health - have a diet rich in fresh vegetables fruits whole grains milk and milk products nuts beans legumes lentils and small amounts of lean meats. avoid saturated fats. exercise at least 150 minutes/week and increase the intensity of exercise gradually. do not use tobacco alcohol weed or street drugs in any form. practice safe sex. get hpv vaccine.
immediately a breast cancer survivor. on the drug tamoxifen i missed a day. can i take 2 pills in one day?
no if you missed it completely do not double up. in the future if you miss a dose and remember within 8 hours you can take the dose. a weekly pill case can be a great reminder for taking pills there are also dose reminder apps available.
i have a painless lump in my left nipple i just found i got my nipple twisted really bad when i was a teen. is this breast cancer or just scar tissue?
if it has been stable for a time it's scar gynecomsstia or just a big gland. a 23 year old man has almost zero risk of breast cancer.
i have a painless lump in my left nipple i just found i got my nipple twisted really bad when i was a teen. is this breast cancer or just scar tissue?
breast cancer does occur in males but is quite rare. this may be residual tissue from adolescent gynecomastia a process that can cause nipple/breast enlargement during puberty that usually fades after a year or so. scar tissue might be a possibility but it is worth a doc visit at your age to sort out the true cause. at that time you can explore having it removed.
i feel that i may be developing breast cancer. i feel a hard painless lump in my left nipple that is small. may have been caused by a form of horseplay known as nipple twisting that i had happen to me in teen years. is this lump cancer or scar tissue?
see a breast surgeon specialist for evaluation
i feel that i may be developing breast cancer. i feel a hard painless lump in my left nipple that is small. may have been caused by a form of horseplay known as nipple twisting that i had happen to me in teen years. is this lump cancer or scar tissue?
is quite rare in a male and a small amount of breast tissue under the nipple quite common in young males! i would however get this checked out by a quick physical exam by your primary care provider! hope this helps! dr z
i feel that i may be developing breast cancer. i feel a hard painless lump in my left nipple that is small. may have been caused by a form of horseplay known as nipple twisting that i had happen to me in teen years. is this lump cancer or scar tissue?
if your nipple got really purple i will bet it is scar. or it may well be gynecomsstia. your cancer risk is near zero and if this is cancer it will enlarge or ulcerated. show your physician on your next office visit or if you want it removed.
i have just noticed my right nipple has turned purple. i had breast cancer last year in my left breast. should i be concerned?
yes you should be concerned and you must get an appointment to a gynecologist as soon as possible. if possible please have someone take you to the gynecologist.
is it possible for breast cancer to spread to bones even if it didn't reach the blood system or any lymph nodes?
hi asandler typically cancer spreads through the bloodstream (hematogenous spread) or the lymphatics as you stated. however direct invasion is also possible.
i have to have "xr mammogram both" following breast cancer what does this involve? is it just a normal mammogram?
almost certainly not! my daughter is still struggling with her breast cancer. but things are going ok! wish you well!
i gave birth july 26 and had a lump since about 15 wks preg. i'm 2 mnth postpartum and its still here only much smaller. does sound like breast cancer?
any persistent lump needs to be checked with a mammogram sonogram or possible biopsy.
is it possible to develop inflammatory breast cancer within 3 months of a clear mammogram? i have a small rash on breast 3 mos post clear mammogram.
inflammatory breast cancer (or paget's disease of the breast) can develop quickly starting out in the ducts (as ductal carcinoma in situ or dcis) which generally forms calcifications or spots that are picked up on mammograms; however mammograms are notorious for providing false negative (&false positive) results. that being said the odds are on your side that it's a b9 (fungal? ) rash/dermatiti
maternal and paternal gma had breast cancer fathers sister was just diagnosed. strong enough history to warrant u/s or genetic test? i'm 25 and s. asian
genetic testing not only for you but have it recomended for all females (siblings/cousins/aunts/nieces) of your family. best check with your pcp as to specifically should get it. good luck.
maternal and paternal gma had breast cancer fathers sister was just diagnosed. strong enough history to warrant u/s or genetic test? i'm 25 and s. asian
these are distant relatives so the risk for you is not particularly high (unless your mother or sisters had breast cancer). yet you should do a once monthly breast self examination for any lumps or any changes in the size and shape of your breasts. you do not need to do any tests unless there is any lump palpable. starting at age 40 you should get a mammogram once every one or two years. good luc
my husband has breast cancer and now it's in spleen lung bones and heart muscle. what would be his prognosis? he is 50 years old
conventional treatment your husband can consider a book by simonton called "getting well again" and the books and work of patrick quillan about nutrition. peace and good health.
my husband has breast cancer and now it's in spleen lung bones and heart muscle. what would be his prognosis? he is 50 years old
when the cancer invades the bone lung spleen and heart muscle the prognosis would be guarded. however this topic should be addressed by the oncologist who takes care of your husband.
mom had breast cancer i used to drink a lot i took birth control etc. i feel like my risk of breast ca is incredibly high. prophylactic mastectomy?
alcohol consumption over certain level may increase your risk to some degree and obviously family history does too but i would not go crazy thinking it's "incredibly high". i suggest you talk to your doc and ask to see a specialist in risk assessment to get a better estimate of your risk and maybe some tips on how to reduce it. don't live in fear my friend. best to you.
mom had breast cancer i used to drink a lot i took birth control etc. i feel like my risk of breast ca is incredibly high. prophylactic mastectomy?
the national cancer institute has an interactive breast cancer risk assessment tool. check it out at: <link>
mom had breast cancer i used to drink a lot i took birth control etc. i feel like my risk of breast ca is incredibly high. prophylactic mastectomy?
i recommend you find a breast center in your area and get a risk assessment. they will also determine if you are a candidate for genetic testing.
mom had breast cancer i used to drink a lot i took birth control etc. i feel like my risk of breast ca is incredibly high. prophylactic mastectomy?
it is good that you quit drinking. i would suggest you to be active regular exercise. consume healthy and well balanced diet. avoid obesity. don't drink alcohol and don't smoke. majority of breast cancer is sporadic and only minority is hereditary/familial. prophylactic mastectomy is optional if your risk for breast cancer is very significant for instance if you carry the brca 1/2 gene mutation.
maybe fibre irregular shape in my right breast when doing an ultrasound. mom had breast cancer 4yrs ago and her aunt before. is a mammogram needed?
for the average risk woman screening mammo should begin at 40. for very high risk patients for example brca gene carriers screening can begin earlier. have your doctor assess your risk profile to see where you fit in.
maybe fibre irregular shape in my right breast when doing an ultrasound. mom had breast cancer 4yrs ago and her aunt before. is a mammogram needed?
probably ok at your age. see your doc. mammogram at your age not usally helpful but may need an ultrasound.
my friend has stomach pains nose bleeds coughing up blood fainting bruises and small lumps on her chest. can this be lung/breast cancer?
i dont think we should answer if this a sign of cancer but we should get your friend to her doctor for a full evaluation for causes of her symptons. dont have her delay the visit.
m 32 and half yr old. hav multiple cysts in both breasts. get my u/s done ev. 2 yrs. got it done 11/2 yr back. at this age can mammography be done on me?
yes it can but mammogram cannot distinguish between cysts (fluid filled) and something solid as well as ultrasound does. so you would likely be referred for ultrasound anyway. unless you have a family history of young breast cancers starting mammograms at 40 is the current recommendation.
mammo in march showed area of interest right breast. had an ultrasound that the radiologist said was" probably" a cyst and said had no suspicious features. she told me to come back in 6 months for a follow up. very nervous about breast cancer. 43f
although any abnormality on a mammo is frightening a lack of suspicious features on ultrasound is very helpful. if you don't have any palpable abnormality or high family risk for early breast cancer a six month recheck is very appropriate.
mammo in march showed area of interest right breast. had an ultrasound that the radiologist said was" probably" a cyst and said had no suspicious features. she told me to come back in 6 months for a follow up. very nervous about breast cancer. 43f
on mammo an area of concern is either that of clustered microcalcificaion or the presence of a stellate lesion suspicious for ca. an area of interest suggests that while no lesion was seen an area of suspicion probably thickened breast tissue present but no discrete lesion for which you lmd would be notified. when a sono was performed one looks for fluid at the site to suggest cyst.
mammo in march showed area of interest right breast. had an ultrasound that the radiologist said was" probably" a cyst and said had no suspicious features. she told me to come back in 6 months for a follow up. very nervous about breast cancer. 43f
the chances are the finding is a benign finding but if you are too nervous about the findings and in order to get a more definitive answer visit a breast surgeon (or a general surgeon or radiologist who is expert in breast care) who can do an ultrasound guided aspiration. this will confirm if the lesion is a cyst. if not a cyst then a core biopsy can be done to establish its nature.
mammo in march showed area of interest right breast. had an ultrasound that the radiologist said was" probably" a cyst and said had no suspicious features. she told me to come back in 6 months for a follow up. very nervous about breast cancer. 43f
there is no need for you to be worried or nervous. if you are uncomfortable with waiting 6 months to get it rechecked see your doctor and ask if the 'cyst' can be aspirated. see a surgeon who does breast surgery. life is too short to worry about things we can do something about!
my mom had an acoustic neuroma a 36 and breast cancer at 54. are these related?
i'm not aware of any association linking these two conditions.
my mom had an acoustic neuroma a 36 and breast cancer at 54. are these related?
there is no relation between these disorders.
my mom had an acoustic neuroma a 36 and breast cancer at 54. are these related?
acoustic neuroma is fairly common and of course breast cancer is very common. the genetic pathways and genetic syndrome that give rise to these do not to my knowledge overlap -- and by now they are fairly well worked out. you're to be commended for your commitment to health and you'll want to keep up self-exam and perhaps mammography to catch any breast cancers early.
mammogram showed normal. ultrasound normal. fluctuating pain in breasts and right armpit. sporadic sharp nipple pain on right. advice please.
it is unlikely that your symptoms are due to breast cancer or significant breast disease. if the symptoms persist however you should see your doctor for evaluation.
metastatic breast cancer what is survival rate women older than 65?
on many factors such as er and her2 status (+ vs. -) tumor grade how many metastases (a few vs. a lot) the location of the metastases (bone vs. liver/lung/brain) the general health of the patient and the availability of therapy for her. i would say that as a rule metastatic breast cancer patients do better than other common cancers but of course there are exceptions. saludos.
my mammogram shows a benign lesion. why/how is this there? is it a precurser to cancer? i am 53 and my mom is a breast cancer survivor.
a benign lesion(birads 2) it is not a precursor to cancer and generally no follow up is necessary. benign breast lesions are common incidental findings and include cysts fibroadenomas and lymph nodes among other various things.
my mammogram shows a benign lesion. why/how is this there? is it a precurser to cancer? i am 53 and my mom is a breast cancer survivor.
the breast is a glandular organ susceptible to the effect of exogenous hormones. lesions like fibroadenomas identified as having smooth margins with possible chunky and not microca++ present. benign lymph nodes and various cystic lesions are also seen which can be identified as benign. when questionable needle aspiration or mri of breast can be performed. such lesions are not precancerous.
my mammogram shows a benign lesion. why/how is this there? is it a precurser to cancer? i am 53 and my mom is a breast cancer survivor.
there are a lot of normal benign breast lesions possible. it can be anything from a lymph node within the breast tissue stable calcifications a fibroadenoma and others. benign breast lesions don't turn into cancer. mammograms do turn up a lot of false positive findings that can cause alarm. that's why there is so much controversy about how often they should be done.
my mammogram shows a benign lesion. why/how is this there? is it a precurser to cancer? i am 53 and my mom is a breast cancer survivor.
benign lesions are not pre-cancerous. however as your mother had breast cancer there will be an increased chance that you may develop it therefore have anything suspicious checked out immediately and continue yearly mammograms and breast exams by your gyn.
my mammogram shows a benign lesion. why/how is this there? is it a precurser to cancer? i am 53 and my mom is a breast cancer survivor.
if breast us shows fluid aspiration has to be done under local anaesthesia if. repeat mammo shows anything biopsy must be done-preferably stereotaxic biopsy. any genetic studies done?
my mammogram shows a benign lesion. why/how is this there? is it a precurser to cancer? i am 53 and my mom is a breast cancer survivor.
there are many types of benign breast lesions. causes are not entirely clear likely multi-factorial. usually they are not precursors for breast cancer. however certain types of benign lesions such as proliferative with atypia are associated with increased risk of subsequent breast cancer. therefore these high risk lesions should be monitored and sometime surgery is recommended.
my mammogram shows a benign lesion. why/how is this there? is it a precurser to cancer? i am 53 and my mom is a breast cancer survivor.
imaging studies are usually not confirmatory in diagnosing breast lesions. there are multiple type of lesions that are benign and not precursors to cancer e. f. fibroadenoma cystic disease fat necrosis. it would be prudent to discuss the issue with your doctor who has more information about our health.
my mammogram shows a benign lesion. why/how is this there? is it a precurser to cancer? i am 53 and my mom is a breast cancer survivor.
benign lesions in breast are commonly found. but it requires an experienced radiologist to make a declaration that the lesion seen is indeed benign. what made him say that it is benign? it usually requires a needle biopsy to be sure that something is benign unless it is a fibroadenoma or a cyst. please find out if it is one of these entities. there is little risk of them becoming a cancer.

is a harmless growth without characteristics of cancer. it would be logical for you to be sceened for the braca tumor marker ( blood anaysis ). continue breast self examination and follow up.
my mammogram shows a benign lesion. why/how is this there? is it a precurser to cancer? i am 53 and my mom is a breast cancer survivor.
monitoring of your benign lesion especially with your family history. some lesions could be precursor to malignancy most the time benign lesions like thickened breast tissue remain benign. some times need tissue examination with image guided needle biopsy to assertion histological status. follow your doctors advise
my mammogram shows a benign lesion. why/how is this there? is it a precurser to cancer? i am 53 and my mom is a breast cancer survivor.
the most common cause of benign lesions are fibrocystic breast changes which occur in 90% of women by age 40 and do not increase the risk of breast cancer. your mom's breast cancer does increase your risk especially if it was premenopausal but this finding does not necessarily increase it anymore. continue your monthly breast self exams annual mammograms and annual exams by your doctor&exercise
my mom had invasive lobular breast cancer. is that more hereditary than invasive ductal?
most of the statistics i have seen show similar rates of lobular cancer in carriers of brca 1/2 mutations (which is the most common recognizable inherited breast cancer trait) compared to non-carriers. exception: carriers of cdh1 mutations (hereditary diffuse gastric cancer syndrome) have high risk for aggressive stomach cancer and lobular breast cancer.
my mom had invasive lobular breast cancer. is that more hereditary than invasive ductal?
dr rau of the paracelsus institute has found that most cases of invasive breast cancer are due to poor root canal therapy outcomes draining from the mandible on the same side. the issue with unresolved mandibular infection is more important than genetic factors in predicting such cancer development. i find that the issue is more related to jaw infection than rct involvement.
my mom has breast cancer and her mother had pancreatic. should she test for palb2? i'm negative for it but she wasn't tested.
palb2 and to some degree brca2 mutations can increase the risk of pancreatic cancer (as well as obviously breast) but these cases may be unrelated. i would assume her oncologist is aware of this and has taken a good family history to see if further work up is needed. is she still seeing a cancer doc? if so she should ask him/her about it. if not have her bring it up with her primary doc.
my mom has breast cancer and her mother had pancreatic. should she test for palb2? i'm negative for it but she wasn't tested.
we usually do tests to help us decide what to do. your mother already has breast cancer and is being treated so it wouldn't change her treatment. pancreatic cancer is not associated with this mutation
my grandmother and uncle had breast cancer then to other organs. my uncle had braca type 2. is that the "cancer" type i should worry about?
right word. brca 2 mutations are associated with increased risk (not a certainty) for breast ovary pancreas prostate and maybe other cancers. i would assume your uncle has seen a genetic counselor and was told who in the family should test and in what order. if you do carry the mutation make sure you act to reduce your risk of cancer as much as possible. don't worry but be aware. best 2u.
my grandmother and uncle had breast cancer then to other organs. my uncle had braca type 2. is that the "cancer" type i should worry about?
brca2 is part of the "spell checker" protecting the dna instruction book that controls how our cells grow and divide. your uncle inherited an abnormal brca2 increasing the chance a cell would become cancerous from a misspelling in the dna. there is a chance that other family members inherited it too. they can be tested and then undergo special screening or risk reducing surgery a la a. jolie
my mum has pns from breast cancer causing cerebellum dengeneration. i am 30 years old and want to know what i could do to prevent the same fate?
your mother developed paraneoplastic cerebellar degeneration due to breast cancer. not sure which "fate" you mean. paraneoplastic syndromes are rare. you can't have a paraneoplastic syndrome without the neoplasm. so your concern should be about getting breast cancer. your discussion should be with your mother's oncologist about your genetic predisposition to breast cancer if you haven't done so.
my mom had breast cancer at 54-- can i still have a few glasses of wine a week?
alcohol intake is one of the risk factors for breast cancer. you have already one in your heredity. see this site for more information on this subject however no good can come from drinking alcohol. even the so called benefits of moderate intake are in question. <link>
my mom had breast cancer at 54-- can i still have a few glasses of wine a week?
increased alcohol consumption is a risk factor for all types of cancer not just breast. people who drink moderately have lower risk than those who don't drink at all and those who drink heavily. no more than 1 unit per day. 1 unit=1 12oz beer 1 4oz glass of wine or 1 1/2 oz spirits.
my mammography shoed a 25-50 percent scattered fibroglandular densities should i discuss this further with my doctor?
your breast tissue density on mammography of 25-50% is not considered "dense". women with dense tissue density on mammography (greater than 50%) which slightly elevates the risk of breast cancer and more importantly makes it harder to detect cancer are advised to have a discussion with their doctors about further imaging options.
my great-grandmother grandmother and mom had breast cancer and i'm scared i'm going to get it. what are my chances?
you definitely have a higher risk of developing breast cancer the good news is there is many ways of testing and preventing breast cancer now a days first your doctor can order genetic testing that can predict if you have the gene that could lead you to breast cancer and if that is the case there is many ways of prevention so do not let the fear stop you from seeking the truth good luck
my mom has breast cancer what can you tell me about this disease?
<link> org/healthy/morewaysacshelpsyoustaywell/breastcancer - it has great info from the american cancer society. take care.
my wife was just diagnosed with invasive ductal carcinoma stage 2 breast cancer. what can you tell me about this kind of cancer?
stage ii breast cancer indicates a slightly more advanced form of breast cancer. the cancer cells have spread beyond the original location and into the surrounding breast tissue and the tumor is larger than in stage i disease. however stage ii means the cancer has not spread to a distant part of the body. at resection the lymph nodes were neg and treatment standard depending on hormone status.
my sister aged 41is diagnosed with invasive ductal carcinoma with t4 n2 mo is it curable. lft 2d echo ultrasound abdomen is free from cancer?
with the info provided a t4 n2 m0 makes it a stage 3b. a cure is unlikely but that is not to say it is not treatable. breast cancer treatment can lead to living many years after the diagnosis. you/she needs to address this question with her oncologist. the medical cancer doctor can answer your question more specifically as they have the details concerning her specific cancer.
my left nipple is so itchy. could it be breast cancer?
it's prudent to have any new and persistent itchy patch on the skin examined by a dermatologist. skin cancer can sometimes present with itching.
my left nipple is so itchy. could it be breast cancer?
if skin of the nipple is normal in appearance when compared to opposite side there is no cancer. ca of the nipple or areola area is crusty and represents pagets disease of the nipple which involves the terminal portion of the milk ducts. these end ducts develop cancer and spill out over the areolar area and require surgical resection if bx proves cells are malignant.
my mother is 56 with breast cancer and bone disease. best treatments?
i assume your mother has breast cancer with spread to the bones. most breast cancer that spreads to the bones is positive for the estrogen receptor. if that is true and there is no spread to liver lungs or brain the treatment is usually an oral pill that blocks estrogen production. chemotherapy is used if the cancer has spread to other organs or if it does not have the estrogen receptor.
my sister in law has just gone through chemo and radiation for breast cancer is not sleeping at all can she take adco-zolpidem-hemitartrate?
that question is best asked of her treating physician or the one who is responsible for managing her chemo/radiation treatments. i don't see why not but then again i'm not an oncologist.
my mother has a breast cancer now she has fever with 38. 7° and last monday she has done first cycle of chemioterapy. could she take paracetamol?
however be aware that fever could indicate a serious infection or recurrence hence inform the treating oncologist
my mother has a breast cancer now she has fever with 38. 7° and last monday she has done first cycle of chemioterapy. could she take paracetamol?
a fever after chemotherapy is worrisome. chemo can suppress the immune system and make it easier to get sick. try to get in touch with her chemo doctor. if you are unable to do this you might consider going to the er at the hospital where the chemo was given. best wishes!
my mother has a breast cancer now she has fever with 38. 7° and last monday she has done first cycle of chemioterapy. could she take paracetamol?
institutions that administer chemotherapy typically have a hotline 24/7 that clients can call with questions.
my mom has a grade 3 stage 2 her 2 breast cancer. how deadly is this? what are her chances of survival?
the answer partly depends on whether your mom has stage iia or iib breast cancer. but it's even more complicated than that. in some ways it is good that your mom has her-2 positive breast cancer as there are several new excellent drugs that are now available that significantly improve survival. if your mother hasn't had surgery yet she could be treated with iv herceptin perjeta (pertuzumab) + chemo.
my mom has her2 breast cancer stage 1 grade 3. what are the odds she'll live?
stage 1 is the earliest stage of breast cancer. the chance she'll be alive in 5 years is more than 95% as long as she has treatment. patients with her2 positive breast cancer should receive a year of herceptin (trastuzumab) as part of chemotherapy. stage 1 breast cancer even if it is grade 3 and her2 positive is curable. don't worry i'm happy to tell you she has a great prognosis!
my pth is 130 calcium 8. 5 i have metastatic breast cancer w/mets to bones. what does the above mean?
hi. i'm very sorry about your cancer. i hope treatment is going very well. breast cancer can make a "hormone" related to pth but it cannot make pth. the pth-like cancer hormone causes hi blood calcium. your low-normal calcium with hi pth is called secondary hyperparathyroidism. your pth is hi to protect you from low blood calcium. causes: gi malabsorption vit. d deficiency kidney calcium leak.
my pth is 130 calcium 8. 5 i have metastatic breast cancer w/mets to bones. what does the above mean?
both your measured pth and calcium levels are high and this is likely because the breast cancer cells are producing too much pth hormone which is making your body produce too much calcium. you should discuss this in detail with your oncologist to understand your treatment plan
my mom is undergoing chemotherapy-currently taxol- for breast cancer-is neuropathy that comes and goes a normal side effect?
it is one of the side effect speak to the oncologist it is good drug to stop the cancer cell growth. good luck
my mom is undergoing chemotherapy-currently taxol- for breast cancer-is neuropathy that comes and goes a normal side effect?
taxol (paclitaxel) is a great drug but does cause some discomfort in the form of neuropathy but it is temporary problem and should not become a major issue even if you continue the drug use
my breast is hurting on n off and warm to hot with sharp pains. is this a sign of breast cancer?
pain is an uncommon presentation but i would recommend you see your doctor for a breast exam. hope this helps.
my mother just passed away peacefully last week due to liver cancer and cirrhosis. do i have to do check up? she might have breast cancer too.
it never hurts but it really depends on what caused her liver cancer and cirrhosis. if it was hepatitis c that is usually transmitted sexually or thru iv drug use. alcoholism can cause cirrhosis as well. if she had breast cancer you might want to consider genetic testing for that brca test (breast cancer antigen) especially if other female family members have a history of it or ovarian cancer
my grandmother an one of my aunts died from breast cancer and another aunt and uncle had it but beat it. i was wonder how at risk i am of getting it.
the baseline risk fro any woman to develop breast caner is 1 in 8. if one first degree relative has breast caner (mother daughter or sister) the risk becomes 1 in 3. with 2 second degree relatives ((aunts grandmothers etc) the risk is also 1 in 3. in the case you describe the risk should be about 1 in 3 for you to develop breast cancer. detection is key to a good outcome - exams mamms ect.
my fathers grandmother and my mothers mother both had breast cancer i am 40 should i be worried. does it skip generations or is it off mom or dads?
developing breast cancer is not just genetic there are lots of factors. but yes if there is a strong family history a person should be concerned. it depends on when your relatives had breast cancer. if many had breast cancer in their 40-50's then there should be some concern. genetic breast cancer can come from mom or dads side due to autosomal dominant nature difficult to tell regarding skip.
my g'ma had breast cancer at 60 my aunt got it at 41 another aunt about 50. dr said my r nipple problem is eczema; at 27 should i have a mammogram?
a breast specialist if you have not already. an uncommon form of breast cancer called pagets disease of the nipple can present as eczematous-type changes in the nipple region. they can determine if imaging(likely ultrasound as the initial test in your age group) is needed.
my g'ma had breast cancer at 60 my aunt got it at 41 another aunt about 50. dr said my r nipple problem is eczema; at 27 should i have a mammogram?
could be mistaken for nipple eczema. with a strong family history you need to see a specialist breast surgeon for evaluation including imaging and even possible biopsy.
my mom had lobular breast cancer at 52. brca negative. is lobular breast cancer more genetic based than ductal?
a quote from lancet<link> ncbi. nlm. nih. gov/pubmed/9167459: "the occurrence of invasive lobular carcinoma and invasive ductal carcinoma was not significantly different between carriers of brca1 or brca2 mutations and controls. medullary or atypical medullary carcinoma was however found more often in brca1 (13% p
my wife is 55 years. after breast cancer chemothrapy she has lost interest in sex life. any solution?
it is possible she is depressed from all happened with the cancer diagnosis and treatment procedures. counseling and talking to her gyn might bring some solution
my girlfriend is suffering from breast cancer but she love it when i kiss her breast in past. can i still kiss her nipples?
yes. treat her with the same loving care you did before!
my mom has 3rd breast cancer recurrence but is brca1/2 negative. am i high risk for breast cancer?
breast cancer does have some hereditary tendency. so sisters and daughters of a breat cancer patients have a small increase in their risk for developing breast cancer. yet >90% of the time there is no relationship to such an occurrence. so you need to be vigilant but not worry much about it. just learn about breast self examination and do annual mammograms beginning at age 40 yr.
my mom has 3rd breast cancer recurrence but is brca1/2 negative. am i high risk for breast cancer?
there is many type of breast cancer. some are congenital. some are not one out of eight women in the us will get breast cancer check your own genetics get your mammogram and have a yearly physical. and do your self examination monthly.
please describe a good idea for a breast cancer awareness event/fundraiser in a small local town?
breast reconstruction awareness day or bra day is october 17th. you could have people design bras that can be auctioned as part of a fundraiser as well as other items!
please explain who has the power to reduce charges for breast cancer screening?
there are a number of charges that are expensive to patients including by not limited to chemotherapy radiation therapy and surgery. since i perform reconstructive surgery i can only comment on those. in the us there are several issues with insurance and how they treat their clients and physicians. that being said the fee schedules are provided to administrators of practices and vary regionally.
please explain who has the power to reduce charges for breast cancer screening?
like anything that costs money there is no one person who dictates what things cost. the cost of screening is usually based on the equipment pay for the staff malpractice insurance rent for the offifce etc. just like the cost of a resturant meal is related to the factors that it takes to make that meal. there are women's health clinics that may offer discounted rates sometimes even free.
please describe the mode of inheritance of breast cancer?
as many as 10-15% of breast cancers in the us are believed to be hereditary. these are linked to mutations of a particular group of genes called the brca genes. there is a simple blood test to check to see if someone has a brca mutation. there is a 50:50 chance of inheriting this from either parent. if a woman inherits this gene there's a 50-75% chance of breast ca; men will have <10% risk.
please describe the mode of inheritance of breast cancer?
more than 80% of breast cancers are not considered inheritable. those that are can come from either side of your family. maternal history is generally considered a higher risk.
preteen son has problems with his nipples. could it possibly be breast cancer?
a 11-13 yo male who has developed nipple enlargement or tenderness is involved in a ritual of passage. about 1/2 of males will undergo this and in some it is quite dramatic. it is characterized by spongy tissue directly under the nipple. it can effect one or both sides lasts an average of 6 mo with a few cases lasting up to 2 yrs. kids carrying extra weight can have more prominent findings. not cancer.
preteen son has problems with his nipples. could it possibly be breast cancer?
it is most likely hormone related. puberty can cause hormone levels to be high and cause nipple and breast tenderness. i recommend speaking with his pediatrician for an evaluation.
pain&cyst in rt hip also had breast cancer is this anything to woot about?
should be checked by your doctor. if it really is a cyst it is unlikely to be anything serious. however anyone with a history of cancer should have small things checked because sometimes cancer recurrence can present with minor symptoms. see your doctor to give yourself peace of mind and proper evaluation if necessary.
pain&cyst in rt hip also had breast cancer is this anything to woot about?
breast cancer can be very sneaky and show up late and away from breast with bone lesions.
please explain who do i contact to get checked for breast cancer?
care provider or community clinic and get a history and physical. many communities have free or low cost screening programs. given your age a screening mammogram would be the usual next step assuming the history and physical did not reveal anything concerning. then see what the mammogram results are. you should perform breast self exam every month in the shower - ask your doctor for instruction.
pain in my breast but no sign of breast cancer. what this pain should be?
breast pain is mastodynia or mastalgia. it is very common in women & usually related to monthly hormonal changes or from hormone medications. it is common in fibrocystic breast condition. need to be sure there is no cancer. many sites list treatments of low fat diet etc. see your gynecologist for treatment discussion.
pain in my breast but no sign of breast cancer. what this pain should be?
there are many causes of breast pain. cancer is unlikely but a breast exam and mammogram are recommended particularly if you have a family history. the most common cause is fibrocystic disease especially if the pain fluctuates with the menstrual cycle. it is also important to rule out other causes as sometimes "breast pain" isn't coming from the breast.
pain on my right breast feels sore when moving but when i touch my breast i feel nothing could it be breast cancer?
breast pain may be a sign of cancer however breast pain is far more commonly due to benign processes. cyclic changes in hormone levels are a common cause of breast pain. if this persists beyond a few cycles i suggest you see your gyne for a breast exam. the risk of breast cancer at age 20 is exceedingly low.
pain on my right breast feels sore when moving but when i touch my breast i feel nothing could it be breast cancer?
based on your age and symptoms but an internet consultation should not substitute a real evaluation by your family doc or gyn. best to you.
pet scan in jan 2013 showed 4 cancerous nodules in lungs from breast cancer. new pet scan july 2013 - lung spots no longer metabolically active; does this mean they are no longer cancerous?
pet provides the benefit of early identification of ineffective chemotherapy particularly metastatic breast cancer as various alternative treatment options are available & allows patients to be spared the toxicities of ineffective treatments. complete metabolic response is a great prognostic indicator with significantly increased overall survival compared to patients showing no response.
pet scan in jan 2013 showed 4 cancerous nodules in lungs from breast cancer. new pet scan july 2013 - lung spots no longer metabolically active; does this mean they are no longer cancerous?
the only way to determine that this is actually metastatic breast cancer would be to perform a biopsy and evaluate if that tissue is breast carcinoma. a pet scan just shows an increase in cellular glucose utilization but does not tell you anything about the cell type.
pet scan in jan 2013 showed 4 cancerous nodules in lungs from breast cancer. new pet scan july 2013 - lung spots no longer metabolically active; does this mean they are no longer cancerous?
they are likely still malignant just not up taking the tracer. it may b a good opp to respect them if they are the only lesions seen.
pl explain er pr cerbb2 all shows negative besides not responding to oral treatment what other significance of this test for breast cancer?
er pr erbb2 negative is also known as triple negative estrogen receptor progesterone receptor and epidermal growth factor receptor (also known as her2) negative breast cancer (bc) and represents 20-25% of all bc. in general these bc are more difficult to treat and require more aggressive treatment including platinum based chemo. the most important prognostic feature of any bc is stage.
pr er and cerbb2 all negative stage 1b full mastectomy with recon size 0. 8 cm invasive lobular casinoma in situ do not want chemo what's yr opinion?
breast cancer is very complicated and there are many variables so hard to say in your particular case. but generally lcis is usually considered a marker for increased risk of an invasive cancer in both breasts (at equal risk). invasive lobular carcinoma is treated like "regular" or ductal carcinoma. your post seems contradictory (it can't be both in situ and invasive). would need more info.
please tell me if it is uncommon for teenage girls to get breast cancer?
15% of women diagnosed with breast cancer are between the ages of 15 and 39. . and most are closer to 39. it's always possible but very unlikely for a teenager to get breast cancer.
please tell me if it is uncommon for teenage girls to get breast cancer?
teenage girls to get breast cancer- but they should still regularly do a self- breast exam.
please help! i have a red spot ( 1 1/2 in in diameter) on my right breast could this be inflammatory breast cancer?
most likely it is just an infection. but it could very well be cancer and either way you should see a doctor right away.
please explain what are the chances of getting breast cancer when you're always on your coiled bra?
the claims that you can get cancer from your bra was made up with no evidence whatsoever by an anti-brassiere crackpot in the 1990's. it's just not true. ignore it.
please explain what are the chances of getting breast cancer when you're always on your coiled bra?
for cancer. an older book that was not based on any scientic principals stated that underwire bras increased risk for breast cancer by effecting lymphatic drainage from the breast. it simply was not true.
please tell me if it is possible for a mammogram to miss something?
no test is 100% accurate. in general mammography is about 80% sensitive for detecting cancer. sensitivity is decreased somewhat. in women with dense breasts. mammography remains the best test that we have available to screen for breast cancer.
please tell me if it is true you can get breast cancer by carrying things in your bra?
carrying radioactive materials in your bra _ then no. i know of no studies or data that suggests that this causes breast cancer. take care.
please tell me if it is true that birth control pills gives you a higher chance to get breast cancer?
slightly.
please tell me if it is common to be asked to be tested for breast cancer?
it is a good practice standard to be offered to any woman. i hope you do self-exam and comply with mammography national standards.
please explain what are causes of breast cancer?
the exact answer is not known. the likely factors are hereditary/genetics hormones obesity alcohol and may be diet and lack of excercise. please see this site for more info. <link>
please explain what are the signs of breast cancer?
can include a mass. masses that are painless irregular ; hard are more suggestive of cancer but they can also be tender painful ; soft. swelling of breast; thickened red skin; non-milky nipple discharge; new retraction of nipple puckering or irritation of skin or pain ; sometimes swollen lymph nodes under arm(s). seek med eval if you have suspicious symptoms.
please help! what gift should i get someone with breast cancer?
love and support are the most meaningful gifts you can give. if you are a person of faith - consider praying with and for the person. let the person know that they are cherished. take care.
please explain what are the most accurate and honest statistics of surviving stage 3 breast cancer?
stage iii over all survival of 72% is getting even better reaching 82% with current advanced treatments speak to your oncologist for all available treatments
please explain what are symptoms of breast cancer?
in this country breast cancer is most often detected by mammogram before any symptoms. other symptoms include a painless new lump swollen lymph nodes in the armpit dimpling in the skin of the breast a newly inverted nipple scaling or crusting of the nipple or a sore on the breast that has grown and doesn't heal. for any new symptom in your breast see a health provider!
please tell me if it is possible for a male to get breast cancer?
albeit rarely only 2 000 new cases every year in the u. s. males who are brca carriers have a higher risk maybe 4-8% chance of getting cancer during their lifetime. men should be aware of any lump in their breast and promptly seek medical advise.
please tell me can a 19 year old female have breast cancer?
possible. there is a tumor called cystosarcoma that can happen in younger women. get her to a doctor.
prostate cancer vs breast cancer which one is more dangerous?
breast and prostate cancers are among the most treatable cancers. the risk of ever dying of cancer with either diagnosis is about one in four.
past 3 mos my period has been a week+ late. recently found breast lump. can breast cancer cause hormonal changes that would cause this? sawpcpmamschedu
but breast cancer can be seen in conjunction with ovarian cancer. that said there are much more common causes of late periods and the vast majority of breast lumps are not cancer. this is especially true in young women such as yourself. good luck with your mammogram. make me look smart. <positive_smiley>.
past 3 mos my period has been a week+ late. recently found breast lump. can breast cancer cause hormonal changes that would cause this? sawpcpmamschedu
these are changes and symptoms that occur normally in reaction to hormonal changes. if you are having irregular periods then the breast can feel lumpier and tender. this is known as fibrocystic changes (see my other posts on the topic) if you have lumps that do not feel normal to you then i recommend you get evaluated by your doctor. breast cancer is not typical in your age group.
please explain if it is possible to get lung cancer after a mastectomy?
if a person has a mastectomy for treatment of breast cancer that person can develop an unrelated cancer that starts in the lung or the breast cancer could metastasize to the lung (would still be called breast cancer). one cancer does not spare you from another.
please explain if it is possible to get your breasts removed without having breast cancer or being trans?
many things are possible. why would someone undergo a surgical procedure if not necessary? i don't understand the question.
please explain if it is possible to get your breasts removed without having breast cancer or being trans?
in the extremely rare situation of having very strong family history of breast cancer with dense breasts on imaging large pendulous breasts that cause chronic neck and back pain and or personal hygiene issues or for gender transformation it may indicated. normally this is undertaken after a serious thought and medical indication and discussion.
please help! what is the survival rate for stage 2 a breast cancer?
according to the american cancer society the 5 year relative survival rate for stage 1 is 100% stage ii- 93% stage iii is 72% and stage iv is 22%.
please help! what is the best course of action for breast cancer treatment?
of specialists (breast surgeon med onc and rad onc) preferably working together in a multidisciplinary setting who will evaluate the situation from the beginning and make a concerted plan of attack. this should include dietitian physical therapist and if needed a genetics counselor.
please let me know if there is any correlation between breast cancer and lung cancer?
i am not aware of a direct correlation between breast cancer and lung cancer.
please explain why is breast cancer in males more severe than in females?
but it is probably because of more advanced staging at diagnosis. most people don't think of men getting breast cancer so there is less self examination and lower level of suspicion by patients and sometimes even by doctors.
please let me know if there is a way to prevent breast cancer health issues by removing breast tissue but leaving nerves and putting an implant?
yes there are several ways to protect yourself from breast cancer depending on your family and personal history. a good oncologist can guide you. you have at least 3 options: be under close supervision of an expert who can screen and detect cancer early if it ever appears on the scene. prophylactic mastectomy is an option but not recommended. preventive medicines are available and are quite effect.
please explain if it is true breast cancer can be caused by hot water left outside and then cold in fridge.?
not elated.
please explain if it is possible to cure breast cancer?
according to the american cancer society the 5 year relative survival rate for stage 1 is 100% stage ii- 93% stage iii is 72% and stage iv is 22%.
please explain why is stage 4 breast cancer considered metastic cancer if it has begun in the breast?
of stage 4. you are correct in that the cancer will keep the name of the place it started at so if a breast cancer metastasizes let's say to the bones or the lungs it is called stage 4 (metastatic) breast cancer.
please tell me could a 13 year old have breast cancer?
although possible breast cancer is rare in premenopausal women and it is extremely extremely rare in teenagers. in a teenage girl a breast lump is more likely maturing breast tissue or a benign mass such as a fibroadenoma or fibrocystic disease. if there is a concern she should see her primary care physician; if the physician is concerned referral to a surgeon would be in order.
please tell me could you tell me 3 ways used to treat breast cancer and one weird alternative i. e vitamin d?
surgery radiation and/or chemotherapy. if you use vitamin d as an "alternative" to all three of these you're a dead fool. vitamin d deficiency might put a woman at greater risk for breast cancer (it does have some potent effects on cell growth) but as a treatment i don't think so. new biologicals such as herceptin and taxols might be placed apart from chemo. tumor lymphocytes are a novel rx.
please tell me could doctors detect breast cancer through blood?
cancer is a tissue diagnosis.
please tell me could doctors detect breast cancer through blood?
there is no good test yet. hope this helps.
please tell me could i get breast cancer from repeated hits to the breasts?
to my knowledge repeated breast trauma is not a risk factor. i have to wonder why are you getting frequent hits to the breasts. .
please tell me could lumps caused by breast cancer be tender when touched or pressed?
many breast cancers are not painful. however some are painful. any new lump in the breast need to be checked by a health care provider to establish its nature. majority are benign (non-cancerous) but some may be breast cancer. please have a medical evaluation.
please tell me could men get breast cancer and what color is the awareness ribbon for that?
men get breast cancer at a rate of about 1% of the rate in women. given that female breast cancer is unfortunately all too common male breast cancer is unusual but not rate. i am not aware of any "ribbon" campaign for male breast cancer; the one for "breast cancer" should be sufficient.
please tell me could breast cancer turn into another cancer?
metastatic and move to other parts of the body (; other types of tissue).
please tell me could babies or children have breast cancer?
a few very rare tumors can occur in the breast before puberty but these are not the common breast cancer so familiar from adult women.
please tell me what's the signs of breast cancer?
•a breast lump or thickening that feels different from the surrounding tissue •bloody discharge from the nipple •change in the size or shape of a breast •changes to the skin over the breast such as dimpling •inverted nipple •peeling scaling or flaking of the nipple or breast skin •redness or pitting of the skin over your breast like the skin of an orange if concerned best evaluated by surgeon.
afraid i may have breast cancer or paget's disease how do i know for sure?
you need a physical exam to begin with my friend. the doc will evaluate your risk for cancer and make sure you are up to date in your screenings. he/she will then determine the need for further work up such as a biopsy. we cannot help you online but certainly hope you do well.
are most biopsies 100% accurately positive for breast cancer? i'm really worried.
hello- sorry to say nothing is 100% accurate. if a biopsy is negative this does not completely rule it out in some cases. if a biopsy does see cancer than it is usually (but not always) accurate. if you have doubts please seek a second opinion from a pathologist at a major cancer center (a university hospital is usually a good place to send the slides and blocks from your biopsy). good luck.

this would be easier to answer if the tumor size and grade wear provided. in general studies in hormone positive breast cancer have shown an advantage to 10 years of tamoxifen over 5 years. though this cannot be extrapolated to ais which are considered more effective than tamoxifen this may be the case. knowing tumor size and grade would help with prognosis.
are there studies of raloxifene for recurrence?
raloxifene is used as a risk reducing agent not typically for treating breast cancer.
are you more at risk for melanoma if you have had breast cancer?
in general a personal or a family history of any cancer slightly increases the cancer risk for other cancers but no specific correlation between breast cancer and melanoma
are you more at risk for melanoma if you have had breast cancer?
if you have had either one it raises the risk of the other. radiation of the breast also increases risk of skin cancers. but do not become a recluse. do routine skin checks see a dermatologist about any suspicious spots learn to look for the features of skin cancers. learn how to protect yourself from sun damage ( you may benefit from a vit d pill).
are there ways to treat breast cancer besides chemo?
every woman's breast cancer is unique to her. because of that treatment for each cancer is individualized -- some cancers require surgery others need more help in terms of removing lymph nodes receiving medicine to kill cancer cells (chemotherapy) or x-rays to kill cancer cells (radiation therapy). there are other new techniques that are not standard. your doctor recommends the best for you

to be round usually irregular if you find a lump must see your doctor if no recent mammography must have it ( in recent sensational study all woman who had lump had mammography ) if indicated biopsy is the option not delay for best out comes
are breast cancer lumps round?
round or irregular in shape. most benign masses like cysts or fibroadenomas tend to be round or oval. so a round shape by itself doesn't tell you whether or not it is cancer. other physical findings and mammo/ultrasound findings need to be evaluated in order to determine whether biopsy is indicated.

reasons for nipple discharge can include stimulation of the breast pregnancy medications galactorrhea (secretion of milk or similar substance) an abscess or other breast infection hormonal imbalances (like hypothyroidism) fibrocystic breasts (breasts are very fibrous) blocked mammary duct breast cancer and intraductal papilloma (non cancerous mass) use of marijuana anise and fennel.
after two years and 3 mammograms i finally had the lump biopsed and was told the lump was a blood clot?
a hematoma or chronic blood clot can look similar to a breast cancer on mammography and ultrasound. it can feel like a lump clinically. sometimes the hematoma will resolve on its own but if it doesn't a biopsy may be needed to make the diagnosis.
at what age can you cease mamograms? all previous mammograms were normal. i am 70 yrs. old.
the uspstf does not provide an age cut-off at which to stop screening older women with mammography; however the uspstf recently concluded that the evidence is insufficient to recommend for or against breast cancer screening for women 75 years or older.

after having both ultra sound and mammogram my doctor requested a biopsy. does this means i am more likely to have cancer?
it's possible that your doctor is concerned about breast cancer. however it's just as likely that he or she wasn't convinced that what was seen on mammogram isn't cancerous. if the ultrasound showed a solid (rather than cystic) mass then s'he is doing the right thing by requesting a biopsy. best wishes.

visible veins is not a sign of cancer
after successful double mastectomy with no lymph node involvement what are my chances of breast cancer coming back in my brain liver lungs or?
recurrence of breast cancer is dependent on the nature of the lesion resected in terms of size and hormone receptors. if the lesion was under 1 cm. and hormone receptor positive with negative nodes after mastectomy cure rate should be in the 90%. also when over the age of 60 results are better than if the condition were the same in a premenopausal 30 year old.

armpit lymph node suddenly and painfully 6 days ago with mild sore throat. soft and like a small marble. it is still palpable. breast cancer?
a painful lymph node that appears suddenly and concurrently with a sore throat may be part of a viral infection but there are many other causes for axillary (arm pit) lymph nodes to be enlarged. if it does not resolve soon or gets larger a medical exam is warranted.
armpit lymph node suddenly and painfully 6 days ago with mild sore throat. soft and like a small marble. it is still palpable. breast cancer?
since breast cancer does not cause throat throat it is likely from a viral infection. if problem gets worse or persists more than 2 wks it is best to get checked out.
a cpl of days ago i saw a small pimple like bump on my breast. i popped it & pus came out. it's now red swollen & larger. could it be breast cancer?
the adage "common things commonly happen" is true. there are sweat & hair pores on your breast & these can be invaded by skin germs and form an pustule or abscess just like they would on other body surfaces. healing is promoted by moist heat(improves blood flow) or opening & draining them. sometimes they require an antibiotic. it is worth a visit but i wouldn't freak about cancer as my first thoght

breast cancer runs in the family would it be a good choice to consider taking out the real breasts and get implants or will the cancer still take over?
some patients with very high risk for cancer can benefit of preventative mastectomies although to be truthful you do not reduce the risk to 0. before you think about that i advise you visit a specialist with expertise in risk assessment and genetics who will estimate your risk maybe order genetic tests and go over your risk-reduction options. best 2u.

breast cancer stage 2a. last chemo on 4/7/14. in hospital fever keeps spiking. could cancer have spread?
it is less likely that your cancer has spread although that is in fact always a possibility. it is more likely that your fever is due to your white blood count being low in response to your chemotherapy an underlying infection or both.
breast cancer stage 2a. last chemo on 4/7/14. in hospital fever keeps spiking. could cancer have spread?
the fever after chemo is much more likely from either the chemo itself (a drug reaction) or an infection if your white cell counts are low. rapid spread of cancer and cancer spread causing fever are unlikely. talk with your oncologist and good luck.

breast cancer 2 tumors one 1. 4x1. 7 the other. 5. biopsy states idc er+ pr- and her2 neg. ki67 score 50 treatment mastectomy chemo and tamoxifen. what are your thoughs on treatment? patient is 32 years old
at 32 you have a long life ahead of you. by removing the breast with multiple tumors you are saving yourself a lot of aggravation. there is nothing to keep a cancer from reoccurring in that breast! you did the right thing. do not look back. you need to move forward! you are getting good treatment from your provider!
breast cancer 2 tumors one 1. 4x1. 7 the other. 5. biopsy states idc er+ pr- and her2 neg. ki67 score 50 treatment mastectomy chemo and tamoxifen. what are your thoughs on treatment? patient is 32 years old
that is a young age to be diagnosed with breast cancer. fortunately it was diagnosed and is er+ which makes it easier to treat. the prescribed treatment sounds appropriate. i would also want to know brca i and ii status and family history to see if a double mastectomy is warranted and if ovarian cancer is also a risk.
breast cancer 2 tumors one 1. 4x1. 7 the other. 5. biopsy states idc er+ pr- and her2 neg. ki67 score 50 treatment mastectomy chemo and tamoxifen. what are your thoughs on treatment? patient is 32 years old
the long term outcomes for patients treated with lumpectomy vs. mastectomy are equivalent for the same stage and type of cancer. having two tumors in the same breast is not an absolute indication for mastectomy unless they are in different quadrants of breast. chemo depends on pathologic tumor stage & other factors. tamoxifen is ok. if postemenoupausal there are other drugs for er+ tumors
breast heaviness left breast only. painful exam. mammogram 2 small areas dense. does this mean cancer? started period at 9 stopped at 56. i am 57

burning feeling on outer side of breast. tender nipple. week after period.
given how recently you finished your period it is likely related to the hormone fluctuations that occur normally during your cycle. breast pain and tingling is almost never associated with breast cancer; the exception is when a woman has a tumor big enough to take over the breast. try ibuprofen to alleviate symptoms; the passage of time will probably also help

breasts itching daily. nipple sometimes worse than rest of breasts but now everywhere. lumps prev. found & ruled cysts. breast cancer runs in family.
it is not feasible to provide a meaningful opinion without taking additional history and physical examination. you may try changing your bra to a natural material. you may also try going without the bra on the weekends to see if that makes a difference. for good health - have a diet rich in fresh vegetables fruits whole grains milk and milk products nuts beans legumes lentils and small amounts of lean meats. avoid saturated fats. drink enough water daily so that your urine is mostly colorless. exercise at least 150 minutes/week and increase the intensity of exercise gradually. do not use tobacco alcohol weed or street drugs in any form. practice safe sex. get hpv vaccine.

if wearing a bra is felt to induce problems because of trauma to the breast cancer is never caused by trauma. occasionally trauma has brought attention to the presence of a tumor. cancer is a 3 stage event and usually induced over a period of time initially by a virus followed by a carcinogen or possible separate virus such as ebv which doesn't induce ca but enhances telomerase.

men get breast cancers that look just like women's under the microscope; they happen under the nipple. it's not that rare; it presents as a mass or less often an ulcer. the word "pectoral cancer" was made up by somebody and it's not in use and not appropriate as it's not cancer of the "pec muscles".

can you have breast cancer without microcalcifications? mammogram shows nodules but no microcalcifications. 3mm 9mm and 7mm. all asymmetry
a typical mammogram will often cite a disclaimer stating something like a negative mammogram cannot exclude a malignancy. that means you cannot draw broad blanket conclusions one way or the other about micro-calcifications. you should have your breasts evaluated further by a breast surgeon.
can you have breast cancer without microcalcifications? mammogram shows nodules but no microcalcifications. 3mm 9mm and 7mm. all asymmetry
there are several mammographic characteristics that suggest benignity or malignancy but we can't use any of them in isolation to make such an important decision diagnostically. all characteristics should be used in unison and if doubt still exists then a biopsy or lumpectomy should be pursued.
can you have breast cancer without microcalcifications? mammogram shows nodules but no microcalcifications. 3mm 9mm and 7mm. all asymmetry
up to 80% of breast cancers do not produce mammographic calcifications. the level of suspicion and therefore the decision to ignore follow up or biopsy solid nodules is based on a variety of mammo/ultrasound features in addition to whether or not there are suspicious microcalcs.

the symptoms of pneumonia are typically acute while the symptoms of cancer usually evolve over a longer time. however the findings on chest x-ray could be similar. the "pneumonia" should be followed by repeat chest x-ray to make sure it resolves with treatment. if any question exists ct scanning or bronchoscopy should be considered.
can breast implants make it harder to find breast cancer during mammography?
breast implants either saline or silicone can obscure mammogram images decreasing the ability of mammograms to reveal breast cancer. still studies show that mammograms are an effective way to screen for breast cancer in women with breast implants. if you have breast implants you can take steps to make your mammogram more successful such as: find a facility that sees many women with breast implants. ask your doctor for a referral to a clinic where radiologists have experience performing and reading mammograms of women with breast implants. speak up about your breast implants at your appointment. if you have noted changes in your breast or if you have concerns tell your doctor promptly. . there's a slight risk that your breast implants may rupture during a mammogram. but the benefits of mammography in the early detection of breast cancer outweigh this risk.
can breast implants make it harder to find breast cancer during mammography?
the implant may overlap/obscure a potential abnormality even though special views are performed to displace the implants. silicone implants are worse than saline implants in this respect and subglandular implants are worse than subpectoral. screening mammography is still indicated because the decreased sensitivity is not sufficient to warrant stopping screening mammography.
can breast cancer radiation cause dry skin? can you offer suggestions for relief?
in addition to dry flaky itchy skin you may experience sunburn-like skin changes to the treated area. if you're struggling with persistent itching and burning symptoms following the radiation treatment consult your radiation oncologist. he or she can help determine whether any underlying conditions are contributing to your symptoms or decide if you should make an appointment with a skin specialist (dermatologist). in the meantime these suggestions may help: stay hydrated. moisturize your skin. moisturizers provide a seal over your skin to keep water from escaping. thicker moisturizers work best including over-the-counter brands such as cetaphil eucerin and vanicream. limit bath time. avoid harsh drying soaps. pat dry. avoid direct sun. . if the itching and burning don't improve or you have blistering or scarring from breast cancer radiation your doctor may recommend various prescription medications to ease your symptoms.

dx breast cancer at 39 thyroid cancer at 40. is a pet scan needed to rule out mets and am i at a risk for other cancers?
you definitely need genetic counseling and testing. a complete family history will help direct this as well. there is no role for screening to look for metastatic disease if you are not known to have it.
dx breast cancer at 39 thyroid cancer at 40. is a pet scan needed to rule out mets and am i at a risk for other cancers?
hereditary predisposition to certain cancers usually occur at earlier ages. at age of less than 50 yrs you would qualify for genetic testing for brca 1 & 2 mutations. a pet scan depending on the clinical situation can detect spread of disease (not as good in the brain) to other organs but in someone with brca gene mutation the development of other kinds of cancer may not occur at the same time.
dx breast cancer at 39 thyroid cancer at 40. is a pet scan needed to rule out mets and am i at a risk for other cancers?
excellent question. it all depends on what type is cancer. if your breast cancer is localized and resectable unlikely you need a metastatic work up with pet. if you have well differentiated thyroid cancer you may also not need pet. however your oncologist may get a baseline scan. you may have a genetic predisposition and may need screening for colon cervical and ovarian ca.
dx breast cancer at 39 thyroid cancer at 40. is a pet scan needed to rule out mets and am i at a risk for other cancers?
interesting question. i would first pursue genetic counseling. pet is not used for routine thyroid cancer surveillance unless the cancer has lost its ability to take up iodine. i get many referrals of breast cancer patients who got pet from their breast doctor and they have thyroid lesions that require evaluation. don't jump to pet. it's easy to do but expensive and most helpful when it is neg.

during ultrasound of liver increased echogenic pancreas was found. i am diabetic non insulin have had breast cancer what should be done?
this was an incidental finding which while showing increased echogenic changes did not reveal a mass or discrete lesion. this diffuse change could represent fatty infiltration or even a low grade form of pancreatitis. neither are associated with a pancreatic lesion or breast cancer. a repeat study in 6 months to see the direction of changes may help.
do you need to remove 100% of a lymph node to check for breast cancer or can they be checked with a needle biopsy?
lymph nodes are only of concern if a malignant lesion of breast is present. usually the breast tumors are small and the incidence of nodal involvement is low so that following excisional biopsy a sentinel node bx is performed removing only those nodes in the field of drainage. if a node is palpable it is best to remove by excisional bx unless very large when aspiration can be tried.

breast cancer can metastasize anywhere but nodes lung brain bone are more common sites.
do all women with small breasts have dense breasts? my mom had dense breasts and had breast cancer at 54. does this mean i will?
most women who have smaller breasts have denser tissue. that is because breast tissue is composed of fibrous tissue and fatty tissue. the smaller breasts have less fat so the fibrous tissue is more condensed. just because your mother had breast cancer does not guarantee you will. however you should be monitored closer because you are at a higher risk. see a local breast surgeon for guidance.
do all women with small breasts have dense breasts? my mom had dense breasts and had breast cancer at 54. does this mean i will?
dense breast have nothing to do with size. it represents a mammographic finding where most tissue seen on the film is breast tissue with little fat present. with age more fat replaces the existing breast tissue so that mammograms can be more easily interpreted. this is one of the reasons mammos should not be performed before age 35. the other is that younger breast tissue sensitive to rt.
does lump size determine its severity in breast cancer?
while size is important and hormone sensitivity and indicator of potenial response. prior to mammograph when lefsion os 5 cm or greater were detected the overall survival rarely was above 60%. with mammography detecting lesion thatt are virtually non palpable wide resection has brought the survival rate into the 90% range for most lesions.
does lump size determine its severity in breast cancer?
size does matter but there is more than just the size of the mass as stated by the responses. it is important to speak with your surgeon and a plastic surgeon and medical oncologist. in some cases chemotherapy before surgery may give more surgical options. good luck!
does lump size determine its severity in breast cancer?
cancerous breast lump size is very important to define but it's just one part of staging. severity of the disease also measured by the aggressiveness of the cancerous cell from well differentiated to poorly differentiated. also hormonal dependent tumor cell as well meaning that er positive do better than negative same with pr and her2 neu. lymph node status is also an extremely important factor
does getting your first period at an age lower than 13 actually increase your risk of ovarian/cervical/breast cancer?
statistically speaking it may slightly increase the risk of breast cancer and ovarian cancer. but in an individual person it makes no big difference so i would not worry about it as there is a long life to make amends and live by a healthy lifestyle and overcome any such risks. if you eat healthy and exercise daily the risk of cancer goes down considerably!

do fibrocystic breast changes increase my risk of breast cancer?
fibrocystic breast changes are common. women with this noncancerous (benign) condition often have lumpy nodular breasts and experience breast pain that varies throughout the menstrual cycle. doctors don't know exactly what causes fibrocystic breast changes but the condition is likely due to hormone changes during your menstrual cycle that affect breast tissue. although fibrocystic breast changes don't increase your risk of breast cancer having fibrocystic breasts may make it more difficult for you to feel a new breast lump or other abnormal change — such as a persistent breast lump that doesn't go away with your next menstrual cycle or thickening or firmness within lumpy breast tissue. it's important to become familiar with how your breasts normally feel so that you'll know when something just isn't right. if you detect something unusual make an appointment with your doctor to have it evaluated.

estrogen receptor negative breast cancer. can i stay on my patch?
please see my page under the above title.
estrogen receptor negative breast cancer. can i stay on my patch?
from a breast cancer standpoint if the tumor is er negative exogenous hormones don't have a target and won't have an impact. if the original tumor was er- there isn't any benefit to hormonal blockade and thus is would seem likely that ert wouldn't have any impact either. outside of breast issues discuss with your doctor (pcp or gyn) the pros and cons of ert as well as alternatives.
early 40's friend recovering from radical mastectomy. should she have counselling or clinical psychology session?
breast cancer in women under 50 can be difficult to accept and handle. it is important to have a good family or friend support system. it helps to get involved with a local breast cancer support group. getting professional counseling is a good idea especially if one is having difficulty accepting diagnosis and moving through daily life activities. no one should go through this alone.
ethical questions arising from hereditary breast cancer and using donor eggs or surrogate?
have genetic counseling going along with genetic testing. i do not know if these genes are dominant or recessive. how do you know what risks known and unknown surrogates eggs carry? do you wish you were not born? do yo blame your parents? do you feel that your biological children would resent having risk and blame you for giving it to them? much pain is caused by guilt and blame. get counseling.
estrogen increases the risk of endometrial cancer but does it increase the risk of breast cancer as well?
studies have shown an increase risk of breast cancer in patients treated with estrogen replacement. in fact women at high risk for getting breast cancer are treated with tamoxifen or evista (raloxifene). those drugs block the effect of estrogen on breast tissue.
estrogen increases the risk of endometrial cancer but does it increase the risk of breast cancer as well?
the studies show mixed results but most agree that long-term estrogen replacement may increase bc risk. my advice: short term ert (<3 years) is generally safe unless you have a bad family history or personal history of abnormal breast biopsies. i would take ert beyond 3-4 years only if you are truly miserable without it. after a few years most women can taper their ert.
estrogen increases the risk of endometrial cancer but does it increase the risk of breast cancer as well?
that is a highly controversial topic with data going both ways. it is easier to say the combination of estrogen and progesterone (together) in a postmenopausal women increases the risk of breast cancer.
estrogen is known for breast enlargement. is it safe to take synthetic estrogen?
long periods of estrogent use (as in hormone replacement) have been proven to increase the risk for breast cancer. this is especially true if taken for longer than 5 years. if you are looking for breast enlargement then you should consult with your doctor. i recommend considering augmentation which is performed by a plastic surgeon. explore all options in order to make informed choice.
estrogen receptor er positive breast cancer adjuvant taxol (paclitaxel) benefits?
in order to answer this question more details are needed (size of tumor lymph node involvement etc). a test that will help to decide if you need chemotherapy or not is the oncotype dx. i highly recommend you speak with your oncologist and even consider a 2nd opinion.
er and pr +ve and her2 _ve is it easy to cure?
if the breast cancer is small and early and not affecting the lymph nodes then hormone receptor positive and her2/neu negative breast tumors can be favorable. need to know more information. can discuss better with the medical oncologist who is treating the patient.
evista (raloxifene) estrogen receptor for uterine cancer?
these are somewhat unrelated questions which makes it difficult for me to address your question. evista (raloxifene) is not used for treating cancer. it is sued for treatment/prevention of osteoporosis. estrogen receptors are specialised protein receptors found in breast cancer. uterine cancer has little bearing on either of the two references you have listed.
extreme pain in breasts. could this be a sign of breast cancer or something else?
pain is usually not the presenting symptom of breast cancer - unless the cancer is advanced and growing through the skin. breast cancer mostly presents as a palpable lump or a mammographic finding. see your md for a good history and physical. ultrasound mammogram or mri could be indicated if there is a suspicious finding.
extreme pain in breasts. could this be a sign of breast cancer or something else?
fibrocystic disease/changes is very common in women. this is most often seen during the menstrual cycle. breast feel lumpy and painful which is caused by cyst formation (fluid filled areas) due to hormonal changes. some women may have these changes without being on their menstrual cycle. caffeine may cause the cysts to be overactive resulting in pain. this is not related to cancer.

estrogen + breast cancer currently on chemo is it ok to drink a protein drink sometimes that has soy in it?
much interest and research o0n phyto estrogens in soy products. no convincing clinical studies to contra indicate soy in diet- especially if occasional use. check to see the content of soy- if it is the predominant source for the protein and you are worried don't. if your chemo is anti estrogen or aromatase inhibitor even less data.
estrogen + breast cancer currently on chemo is it ok to drink a protein drink sometimes that has soy in it?
in general soy intake should be limited in women. there is really no science to guide us as to how much soy is too much. we do know that soy products act estrogen like in our bodies. probably best to limit amount of soy products. now if you only take one shake a day and don't consume other soy products you are definitely ok.
estrogen + breast cancer currently on chemo is it ok to drink a protein drink sometimes that has soy in it?
soy not important.
excluding cancer what could cause a small hard breast lump (mext to nipple) in a 39 yo male?
cysts and fibroadenomas are two non-cancerous breast masses that can be found in men. although male breast cancers only account for 1% of all breast cancers a suspicious mass should always be evaluated. your lump should be evaluated with a combination of physical exam mammography and ultrasound as necessary. please follow up with your pcp.

er+pr+her2+breast cancer stage 2b- lymph vascular invasion-what r stats/odds it's spread to other parts of the body?
if you know you are a stage 2b then i assume you have had surgery. if you were a stage 4 which is spread to other parts of the body that would be known and dictate your treatment. a ct or pet scan can determine if there is spread to other areas of the body. speak to your oncology team about your concerns so they can provide you with additional info. good luck!
family history of breast cancer and found a lump that is thickening. what should i do?
any lump or thickening in the breast requires clincial breast examination and usually a mammogram or ultrasound of the breast. but your doctor can guide you further. i would not delay it for too long.
family history of breast cancer and found a lump that is thickening. what should i do?
it is important to get this area evaluated. you will need a mammogram and ultrasound. if a biopsy is required make sure a core needle biopsy is performed. it will be important to communicate to your providers who in your family has breast cancer. you may need testing for the breast cancer gene.
from research mastitis is common when breastfeeding i have all symptoms of mastitis but not breastfeeding so is this from partner sucking breast?
mastitis is common while breastfeeding but there are other causes and often unrelated to suckling on the nipple. there is also a severe form of breast cancer called inflammatory breast cancer that can look just like mastitis with redness and warmth and swelling of the breast skin. you should have your physician examine you.
for what length of time can a person survive breast cancer if there are no lymph nodes involved?
when we discuss risk for spread after breast cancer surgery we need to evaluate multiple factors including the size of the tumor grade hormone status (estrogen progesterone receptors and her-2) and possibly the clinical risk score (oncotype mammoprint etc).
found a lump on my left breast near the armpit. is this breast cancer?
you are toung but workup needs to start proper screening with self breast exams looking for new lumps breast exams by your physician looking for skin or nipple chanes as well as masses or lymph nodes and mammogram and ultrasound if needed are the best ways to pick up early stage breast cancer before it causes any symptoms. once advanced it can cause many different symptoms throughout the body.
found a lump on my left breast near the armpit. is this breast cancer?
a new breast lump even in a younger woman needs to be thoroughly evaluated as it might be cancerous. please see a doctor. the best place to start would probably be with a primary care physician like an ob/gyn family practitioner or internist. if you do not already have a doctor many communities have breast or women's health centers where you could potentially get care.
found a lump on my left breast near the armpit. is this breast cancer?
to young but any lump especially a newly discovered one in the breast around the breast should be checked out. see a physician and have he/she check it out clinically and if needed have a mammography! any family history? if yes even more urgency!
for what length of time can you live with breast cancer?
on stage and cell type assuming you get good treatment by competent doctors.
for what length of time can a woman with breast cancer live after the cancer has metastasized?
depends on the cell type hormone receptor status. cancer stage at diagnosis prior treatments and chemotherapy where the metastases are located how well the tumor responds to treatments etc. every person & situation is different & the oncologist would have much more information for you.
for what length of time can you live with breast cancer before you die?
early breast cancer can be cured and that person would live the as long as they would normally have if they never had cancer. patients with stage 4 have incurable disease but some can do well for years if properly treated. not true for all sadly. some cancers are very aggressive and cause death quite fast. depends on certain characteristics of the particular cancer.
for a 5mm intraductal breast cancer with 1mm of invasion taken at lumpectomy and then a mastectomy performed how many lymphs should be removed?
the current standard is to perform a sentinel lymph node biopsy; if (+) additional nodes are removed (unless radiation therapy planned which would not be the case with this minimal tumor). the median number of sentinel nodes people have are 2-3 however some have 1 others can have many more--this does not reflect the tumor but rather the way the breast drains towards the armpit.
for what length of time can you live with untreated breast cancer and have no symptoms?
breast cancers are usually present for years before being found. they may produce a mass and no other symptoms until very advanced. this is part of the rational behind screening. if found when small there is an excellent chance at a cure. if found after a long existence cures are more difficult.
for what length of time can you live with undiagnosed and untreated breast cancer?
especially if one includes dcis in this category which is better designated pre-cancer. on the other hand we sadly see neglected breast cancer with the tumor bursting out of the breast skin bleeding and producing a fetid mess. not treating real cancer is a big mistake. dying with uncontrolled local breast cancer is a horror for the patient and those who love them and care for them.
for what length of time do people with breast cancer live if its not treated?
on how nasty a cancer it is. some are very slow growing and women (or men) can potentially live a very long time with the cancer before it progresses and takes their life. others are extremely aggressive and spread quickly taking the life of the person shortly thereafter.
found out i am positive for mutation in brca 1 gene advice needed please?
this is something to discuss closely w/ your md. ovarian ca more likely w/ brca1 than brca2. women w/ either brca have >50% chance of developing breast cancer. if you have it get screened with ca-125 blood test ultrasound mammogram/mri usually starting at age 30. surgery after childbearing includes removal of the uterus ovaries and fallopian tubes as well as mastectomy. good luck.
for awhile my left breast is larger then my other. i feel no lump just feels firmer then the other. no history of breast cancer. likely possibilities?
it is not uncommon for women to have one breast larger than the other but if this is a new thing and if as you say it feels "firmer" i would advise you visit your pcp or gyn as soon as you can for a good exam.
for awhile my left breast is larger then my other. i feel no lump just feels firmer then the other. no history of breast cancer. likely possibilities?
this can be related to many causes most are benign like gynecomastia and related to medications or use of marijuana. it is more concerning that it is unilateral and thus you should see a surgeon to evaluate and get imaging as indicated.
for awhile my left breast is larger then my other. i feel no lump just feels firmer then the other. no history of breast cancer. likely possibilities?
it could a benign ' gynacomastia ' or could be a tumor you need to see your doctor for further investigation. breast cancer is rare in men but 1% of them are in men.
family history breast cancer even mom. 2 cousins got breast cancer but tested negative brac1/2. should i get test. cancer on both sides family?
you and your mom should meet with a genetic counselor. they will sit with you and discuss the family history and draw out a family tree to determine where the risk may be. check with your local breast cancer center for a referral.
family history breast cancer even mom. 2 cousins got breast cancer but tested negative brac1/2. should i get test. cancer on both sides family?
loved ones and your doctor. also discuss what the options are for the possible results
for breast cancer can lymph nodes be tested with needle biopsy or must they 100% be removed to check them.?
larger lymph nodes that can be felt or are over 1/2" on ultrasound can be biopsied with a needle. if that shows cancer often no further lymph node surgery is needed now but might be needed later. if no lymph nodes can be felt and none are enlarged by ultrasound then a "sentinel node biopsy" -- removing the "sentry" or guardian lymph node of the armpit is needed; sometimes more than one.

for oncologists i am a pharmacist i want to know invasive ductal carcinoma in which stage of breast cancer?
invasive ductal refers only to the type of tumor. stage involves lymph node sampling and size of tumor. please read the info on this link: <link> cancer. gov/cancertopics/pdq/treatment/breast/healthprofessional/page3
for oncologists i am a pharmacist i want to know invasive ductal carcinoma in which stage of breast cancer?
the stage depends on the size of the tumor as well as involvement of lymph nodes in the axilla. it is at least stage 1 cancer but could be higher stage if the nodes are positive or the tumor is bigger than 2cm.
for oncologists i am a pharmacist i want to know invasive ductal carcinoma in which stage of breast cancer?
once the tumor has turned invasive there is a possibility that it will cause death so that it needs a stage of at least one. some of the preinvasive lesions get a zero. only when it's been determined how far the cancer has gotten can we narrow in on the exact stage. the oncologists will tell you the same.

most breast cancers present as a painless lump within the breast. your description of itchy painful breast would be an unusual presentation. some advanced cases can present with skin involvement that can look like orange peel with redness. see you doctor for an exam probably time for a mammogram as well. best of luck.
female w/ sore underarm no breast cancer what could be the cause of armpit soreness haven't used any razors/waxing use same deodorant/soap for years?
the armpit with arm down is a partially closed space prone to infections. the skin here has sweat glands and sebaceous glands which can get secondarily infected from sweat. use electric razor to remove hair and then deodorant. hidradenitis or infection from sweat glands is not uncommon
for 2weeks i have had horrible itching on one nipple. no skin changes or discharge. i am a high risk for breast cancer and have many fibroids?
for the most part cancers arise in the breast in association with intraductal pathology. there is micro ca clustered in one area but asymptomatic. itching of nipple with no lesion to suggest pagets would be related to possible histamine release in area with no known cause. at 58 mammo indicated and if all neg use xylocaine (lidocaine) ointment on nipple.
for 4 months i've had a swelling in my armpit by my left breast which is painful at times and it sometimes makes my whole left breast hurt. i seen a doctor but he said it was nothing to worry about. ?
while there are a number of possibilities here swelling in the armpit may represent an enlarged lymph node. if you have recently nursed a baby you may have an infection e. g. mastitis - though this usually presents with a fever. while breast cancer doesn't usually start with pain i'd want to rule this out - though it is unlikely. good doctors value second opinions. make sure you're comfortable.
female breast cancer 5yrs ago check was clear for past 5 yrs. last year check had pain in area had biopsy and ok but still have stent why?
what do you mean by stent? do you mean a stent in the heart or a stent in the breast? if you mean a stent in the heart then it means that a blood vessel feeding the heart muscle was narrowed and to stop further narrowing a stent was placed. i am not if this is what you are asking though
female breast cancer 5yrs ago check was clear for past 5 yrs. last year check had pain in area had biopsy was okcan 3dmarker causing pain be removed?
i'd look for another reason for pain besides the radiographic marker that was placed a year ago. those are inert.
february 2015 i did biopsy test for breast cancer and it out clean my question is do i have to go for it again in february 2016 if not every when should mammogram or biopsy be done for breast cancer?
should have told you exactly what to do after a negative breast biopsy presumably for abnormal mammogram or ultrasound. repeat mammograms are recommended at 6 and 12- month intervals and if there is definite lesion or change in size repeat ultrasound and/or biopsy would be warranted at that time. please make sure you follow your physician's plan closely. thanks for trusting in healthtap.
found about three days ago a red itchy irritated patch on my breast thought it would go away but its still there and worse is it breast cancer? help
it is very unlikely that you have breast cancer however it is not feasible to say what it is without examining the lesion. if the lesion does not go away in a week or gets bigger or if it bleeds or develops a discharge or you get fever it would be prudent to see your doctor or go to a hospital emergency room.
fam history uterine/colon/prostate/breast cancer on both mom/dad sides. all diagnosed before 50. am i at an increased risk?
it would require a more detailed history about your family. it would be prudent to consult your doctor to see if you may need genetic testing and also discuss about starting cancer surveillance at an age 10 years younger than the earliest age of relevant cancer in your family. wish you good health! for good health - have a diet rich in fresh vegetables fruits whole grains milk and milk products nuts beans legumes lentils and small amounts of lean meats. avoid saturated fats. exercise at least 150 minutes/week and increase the intensity of exercise gradually. do not use tobacco alcohol weed or street drugs in any form. drink enough water daily so that your urine is mostly colorless. practice safe sex. get hpv vaccine.
feeling lumpy breast above nipple when pressed. is it normal?
in younger females less than 40 breast mammograms would be ideal if you have a family history of breast cancer. commonly in younger females lumps get tender or more pronounce during menstruation. if you are younger and if this lump is changing in size or getting tender see your doctor for an evaluation. if you are >=50 you should ask your doctor for screening mammogram per uspstf guideline.
give me a hint. what kind of hassle am i facing if doc suspects breast carcinoma? what is required to diagnose?
bottom line is that mammograms are now more woman friendly. soft pads can be used to soften the tightness of the machine many techs are sensitive to draping women with respect and reassuring during the exam biopsies can be done with good local pain/anesthesia control. also american cancer society and others have a variety of support groups about women's breast health and breast cancer treatment.
got 4 symptoms of breast cancer so do i have it?
the only way to diagnose breast cancer is to get a biopsy of the lump/mass/calcifications/abnormality on imaging. i highly recommend you contact your doctor/gynecologist to get a physical examination and then mammogram and ultrasound. this question can only be answered when you follow the steps below. good luck.
got 4 symptoms of breast cancer so do i have it?
i'm not sure what you mean by 4 symptoms of breast cancer. if you have anything that makes you worried about that disease get to a doctor asap. you may have nothing to worry about but you are not the one to make that judgement. also if you do have breast cancer the earlier the treatment the better.
got mammo results both breasts contain residual fibroglandular tissue. no masses or microcalcification. what is residual fibro and will it cause breas
it does not cause breast cancer. unfortunately the diagnoses may require more biopsies!
gene expression profiling predicts clinical outcome of breast cancer?
in the past we used anatomic staging alone (tumor size lymph node involvement) to guide rx. gene profiling allows us a completely separate measure of prognosis and more importantly can predict who may or may not benefit from different chemotherapy agents. in the future we will hopefully be able to tailor our rx to the specific cancer being treated: the elusive personalized medicine.
gma- 95 healthy beat breast cancer last year. today went to doc for pain in leg they believe its bone marrow cancer. what are her chances at survial?
do you actually have a biopsy diagnosis or is the leg pain only thought to have a possible cause from "cancer. " would need much more information biopsy and radiology results etc. it is very didifficult to speculate without accurate detailed information. her doctor would have much more information to be able to give you accurate information.
gma- 95 healthy beat breast cancer last year. today went to doc for pain in leg they believe its bone marrow cancer. what are her chances at survial?
metastatic carcinoma portends a poor prognosis typically. there are a couple of possibilities such as a plasmacytoma/multiple myeloma or metastatic disease would be the most likely diagnoses in this age group if cancer at all the latter being more common. if it is a discussion should determine if she even wants chemo at all as most regimens are very difficult to endure and she may not want it.
gma- 95 healthy beat breast cancer last year. today went to doc for pain in leg they believe its bone marrow cancer. what are her chances at survial?
sorry 2 hear this dx. there r most likely more areas involved. a bone scan will show if there are more areas involved.
getting worried. noticed small tender lump jul16 tenderness went away but now it spread & feels wide and flat tender again above left breast cancer?
to be cancer but you need to see a doctor for an exam to help you determine what you are feeling & give you information for proper future breast self exams. don't try to guess yourself get a proper exam with a doctor.
getting worried. noticed small tender lump jul16 tenderness went away but now it spread & feels wide and flat tender again above left breast cancer?
please see your doctor. given your age breast cancer is very unlikely. however you need to find out what this is. very likely this is something benign - perhaps a cyst that ruptured or a small area of fat necrosis.
girlfriend's mom got breast cancer. what can i say to help?
for most people something like this might be best. "i heard about your cancer. i am sorry. what can i do to help? " this breaks the ice. see how she reacts. remember that in some cultures there are goofy superstitions about breast cancer. it's not contagious caused by spiritual evil or (if caught early) a death sentence. it's very good of you to ask.
general question. what is the 5 year. survival of non-metastasised breast cancer if you only had a double mastectomy and no chemo and no radiation?
not enough information. depends on tnm staging. treatment decisions based on that as well as biomarkers - er pr her2/neu. the absolute risk reduction provided by chemotherapy and/or hormonal therapy can then be individualized. on useful online tool is adjuvant! online. that assumes adequate local control - eg surgery +/- radiation.
got a small lump on my right side in the middle of my breast not on my breast had it for about 2 years could it be breast cancer?
you need to see a gynecologist. you may need an ultrasound or other work up to make sure what you have is not anything worrisome.
grandmother had breast cancer lived she didn't get young what are the odds of me getting breast cancer? is it passed on by family? i don't smokeordrink
breast cancer in women under 25 is very rare. a history of breast cancer in your mother or sister (1st degree relative) significantly increases your risk for breast cancer especially if they are diagnosed at an early age (50 or younger). breast cancer in your grandma is not as significant. breast cancer screening with mammogram is recommended starting at age 40.
grade 3 stage 2 her 2 breast cancer how deadly is this what is the chances of survival for 70 yr old woman what to do?
grade 3 stage 2 her 2 over expressed high risk for recurrence. i would recommend adjuvant chemotherapy and herceptin (trastuzumab). herceptin (trastuzumab) is then given for a year. if she has not had surgery yet then one would definitely consider neo adjuvant chemotherapy with herceptin (trastuzumab) and pertuzumab. age is not a reason not to treat! in addition a 70 year old patient may do very well with chemotherapy. not old.
grade 2 invasive ductal carcinoma infiltrating as cords and tumour cells in a fibroadipose stroma what does this mean?
it will need to be treated in order to save your life. the information about the appearance are to help the physicians determine exactly how best to treat it and there will be some more studies done. i'm sorry this is breast cancer but today the large majority of these tumors are cured.
grade 2 invasive ductal carcinoma infiltrating as cords and tumour cells in a fibroadipose stroma what does this mean?
there are 2 basic forms of breast cancer ductal and lobular. yours tumor is a ductal but it sounds like it has some lobular features in particular it's infiltrating as cords sometimes called "indian file infiltration". i don't think this has any clinical significance. see your oncologist and follow their advice. most important is knowing lymph node status. best of luck and god bless.
going to doctors soon to check symptoms but what are the chances that i could have breast cancer as an 18 yr old? nan and her sister have had bc
breast cancer is too rare under 20 years of age that you should not be thinking about this as a possibility for you. relax and get your doctor to check you just to reassure you and teach you how to watch for early changes of cancer in the breast as there may be some risk as you get into your 40s and older years.
going to doctors soon to check symptoms but what are the chances that i could have breast cancer as an 18 yr old? nan and her sister have had bc
but if there is a positive maternal family history of breast cancer and if there is a high risk breast cancer gene you should be tested and followed closely. breast cancer involves genetic and environmental factors that are only now beginning to be understood. you would do well to consult an expert in this area. learn breast self exam and do it regularly.
going for 2nd opinion on small lump and imaging. 30 yrs old. fibrocystic breast. very scared. what is chance if cancer stage 4?
of course at your age breast cancer is common and with "lumpy" breast you may find yourself going for repeat imaging often in your life. to this and many patients i say please complete the work up. stage iv means that it has spread everywhere which is a rarity at your age. have faith and hold on!
grade 1 invasive ductal carcinoma 2 spots family history 47 years of age small breasts. should i get double mastectomy?
breast cancer can be adequately treated with a lumpectomy in most cases. so a mastectomy is not really necessary. but based on your breast size your doctor can guide you best. many women opt for reconstructive surgery at the same time as removal of your breast cancer.
good evening docs had a breast scan. result; conclusion: bilateral fibroadenosis with right fibrocystic change. pls what does it mean docs? thank u.
most importantly it does not show malignant or benign tumor. because of these changes it might make early diagnosis of breast cancer a bit more difficult. discuss with your doctor who ordered the study.
how/why can breast cancer cause one breast to sag and the other to not?
in a 33 yo female the composition of the breast is mostly glandular and ductal so that mammo shows the breast to be composed primarily of firm tissue which doesn't tend to sag. as one gets older much of the breast tissue is replaced by fat which has the potential of causing loss of conformity and is one of the factors leading to a sagging breast which is found in your case.
how common is it for breast cancer to spread to anterior cervical neck lymph nodes?
lymphatic drainage is predominantly towards axilla but could spread towards neck usually in late stages.
how likely is it for breast cancer to spread to the ovaries?
it is likely to spread when there is abdominal metastasis ( peritoneal ) but not common way of metastasis to ovary with out involving other organs like liver lung etc.
how does alcohol intake during your twenties contribute later to breast cancer?
i am not persuaded there is a cause-and-effect relationship. be this as it may it is moot. keep up breast cancer surveillance like anyone else. look to the future not the past. leave others to make their own choices and plan well for your own future. best wishes.
hi i have 2 ingrown hair on my breast it is really painful and tender is it signs of breast cancer? i am 18 years old.
see dermatologist for ingrown hair excision and laser hair removal
hi i have 2 ingrown hair on my breast it is really painful and tender is it signs of breast cancer? i am 18 years old.
you have infected hair follicle at 18 breast cancer the least thing you have to fear. see your family doctor will examine you then rx you medication to clear them. don't worry.

history of invasive breast cancer since 2006. oncologist ran a ctc test came back positive with level of 1 ctc. does this mean i have metastasis now?
glad you have well survived from invasive breast cancer. your current ctc 0f 1 suggests your further survival is very favorable; that's good clinically. for more review article in <link> of course it would be most logical to ask the ordering oncologist since s/he knows more about your individual conditions than anyone online
hello. can you describe what a fibrocystic breast should feel like as opposed to a breast with a cancerous lump?
breast cancer tends to be very firm non movable and often fixed to the chest wall or other structures. it can start as a nodule that feels "different" then the adjacent breast tissue. if you are not sure what you are feeling please have a md examine the area and have them make the determination.
have blood from nipples which stains bra. had a mammo and ultrasound. no cancer dr is sending me to breast surgeon. is this common? if no cancer why worry
1 in 9 women in the united states will get breast cancer at some point in their lives. so when a women comes in with symptoms of breast cancer such as a bloody nipple discharge its taken very seriously. bloody nipple discharge isn't really normal in any woman. even though the initial tests are reassuring its routine to refer to a specialist for a second opinion just in case. best wishes!
history of long painful periods. been on the pill for 18 years so the doc is worried about breast cancer risk. suggests iud. but copper or hormone?
the worry about breast cancer is unfounded and in fact prolonged use of the pill is protective against ovarian cancer and possibly uterine cancer. the iud is still a good choice but because of your history of long painful periods one of the hormone iud's makes the most sense.
how high are my risk of endometrial cancer. i am a breast cancer survivor of 6 yrs. am on tamoxifen. my sister was diagnosed with endometrial cancer ?
endometrial cancer is rarely hereditary so it is highly unlikely that you will have this problem due to the fact that your sister had it. breast cancer is not associated with it either. tamoxifen usage has some small increased risk for endometrial but it can be easily monitored with once yearly ultrasound test of your uterus. do tell us know if you have any problems
hi i have a disc shaped white patch on my breast and the skin is puckered could this be breast cancer?
i'm concerned by your description of the area as being puckered. you need to see a physician to examen your breast. don't let fear keep you from getting an exam. it may or may not turn out to be anything significant.
how many minimum sittings for chemotherapy is required for 2nd stage breast cancer after mastectomy. is it necessary.
number of sessions for chemo depends on many factors. what kind of breast cancer do you have exactly? how much do you weight.
if you are on you period and you have a lump on the top part of you breast is that a sign of breast cancer?
if the mass persists it would be prudent to see a doctor for an evaluation. wish you good health and a happy thanksgiving.
i have both prostate and breast cancer. is it ok to take avadart for pc and tamoxafin for bc at the same time?
but this is really a question you should ask your oncologist who hopefully is coordinating your care. don't be afraid to ask. it is your life and a legitimate question. assuming the same person has prescribed both it is probably ok to take both. however in general medication doses should always be separated by at least an hour. good luck!
i'm 29. i have fibrocystic breasts. is it alarming when a small complicated breast cyst (no solid mass component) is more "tall than wide"? thank you
but if any changes or if any dishcharge or family history of breast cancer should be seeing a breast surgeon to keep up with screenings and if smoke or take birth control stop this increases risk try natural family planning nfp. com
i binge drank from 20-25 years old. mother had lobular breast cancer at 52 i had first baby at 26 and stopped drinking. should i get breasts removed?
be thankful for stopping drinking. the extra risk is minimal if any. keep up surveillance like any other woman. get any mass biopsied without delay. your chance of breast cancer killing you will be quite small and prophylactic mastectomy will not eliminate it. enjoy the life that you are rebuilding
i have gallstones and i read that could mean i have higher estrogen and now i'm worried that will cause breast cancer. is there any link?
studies show that in postmenopausal women high estrogen does correlate however estrogen correlates poorly with breast density and other factors of increased risk in premenopausal women. you should speak to a physician and have an exam mammogram if appropriate and brca-1 and brca-2 analysis in addition to other high risk profile. <link>
is true that flat chested women are less likely getting breast cancer 'cause of less glandular tissue? thanks
studies on this have been mixed. if there is any correlation it is likely to be small.
is true that flat chested women are less likely getting breast cancer 'cause of less glandular tissue? thanks
breast size is an indeterminate risk factor for breast cancer. please see the following link: <link>
i have red spots on breast that are spreading could it be a forum of breast cancer?
breast cancer almost never presents this way. some kind of skin problem is far more likely. i would be happy to help you with that if you like.
i have fibrocystic breasts and i only get mammograms and ultrasounds every 2 years. is this enough? i am 34 with no family history of breast cancer.
there is controversy about mammography and some doubt that routine mammography reduces breast cancer mortality. what you are doing is more than recommended by preventive services task force. you may consult this site for more info: <link>
i have cherry angiomas on my arms legs and i noticed two new ones on my breast. is this bad or mean breast cancer? why do i keep getting more
these are completely benign. they do not progress on to cancer
i did a breast biopsy and i was reading that breast biopsy causes cancer is that true?
breast biopsies do not cause cancer. if breast cancer develops it's a genetic abnormality in the cells. the mechanical act of cutting tissue for analysis does not change the genetic makeup of the cell. please followup with your gynecologist if you notice a change or lump in your breast.
i hv breast lump since 3 yrs. now i feel pain in breast and armpit. usg showed fibrodenoma of 8mm prolactin is high. can cancer remain same size? 26age
it is rare for breast cancers to remain the same size for 3 yrs. you situation can be explained by the elevated prolactin level which will cause breast swelling and tenderness. cause for high prolactin include certain medications brain tumors and othe4rr glands not working well.
is there such a thing as bilateral breast cancer?
a woman with breast cancer in one breast is at a slightly higher rush of having it in the opposite breast. in some cancers the risk is much higher. biopsies should be able to confirm for you that any lump is benign. see your md
is there such a thing as bilateral breast cancer?
yes
is there such a thing as bilateral breast cancer?
can happen avoid risks; no smoking keep weight normal breast feed if have babies if family history of breast cancer get tested
i've been going through testing to see if i have breast cancer and i've been really stressed and just got over the flu. could this cause a late period?
menses can be delayed if you are going through an intense period of stress. but the delay is no more than a few days. so if you do not have menses over a period longer than 2-3 weeks you should seek consultation with a gynecologist to find the cause.
if you have fibrocystic breast changes do you still need to look for change in lump consistency?
so difficult to tell if significant; look for hard not mobile lumps and bloody nipple discharge and red rash on breast first as bad sign tender lumps that come and go not usually bad but never know if family history of breast cancer see gynecologist or breast surgeon to check it out if smoke very bad risk so don't.
in 2014 a breast ultrasound showed a enlarged lymph node in armpit. was told to watch it. i still feel it. what to do?
1st perform (& have doctors perform) serial breast examinations (bse). breast health's important since breast cancer can often present as an enlarged armpit lymph node. 2nd get mammograms every 2 yrs. it's an accepted screening tool by uspstf. 3rd if it bothers you for other reasons (size change tenderness clothing) talk to a surgeon about removal & biopsy. it's the only way to know 4 sure
is it possible to have stage 4 breast cancer and not know it at 17 yr. old and 2 mo. pregnant? if it is and that's what it is what are some options?
it is highly unlikely that you have breast cancer. if you are pregnant you should be under the care of a doctor for the sake of your and your baby's health. wish you good health and a healthy baby!
i have swollen lymph nose under right arm inflamed nipple and red bumps on breast all on right side. could this be inflammatory breast cancer?
proper antibiotics while ruling out breast cancer. if possible culture aspirate. go get treated. can rapidly get seriously infected.
i had a healthy shake that had soy lecithin in it will that cause high estrogen and breast cancer i'm worried?
one shake is not going to alter your risk for anything. soy lecithin is not a harmful substance anyway and is not a risk factor for breast cancer or any other disease. for good health - have a diet rich in fresh vegetables fruits whole grains milk and milk products nuts beans legumes lentils and small amounts of lean meats. avoid saturated fats. drink enough water daily so that your urine is mostly colorless. exercise at least 150 minutes/week and increase the intensity of exercise gradually. do not use tobacco alcohol weed or street drugs in any form. practice safe sex. get hpv vaccine.
is it possible to get a mastectomy even if you don't have breast cancer nor are at risk of it? if so what is the usual cost? thank you.
when you need a particular treatment and can justify your rationale your doctor is likely to help you to get over your problem. but it may take visits with a couple of different surgeons as your request is a bit unusual. the costs of mastectomy will vary and can be negotiated with your surgeon. most surgeons would charge their fees(range: $2500 to $5 000 for operation). add $5 000 for other costs
i am experiencing tender lump in breast. it hurts my shoulder muscles.
at your age this is usually what is called fibrocystic disease of the breast which is a benign condition resulting from breast cysts. this is usually treated with birth control pills. caffeine and chocolate may make the symptoms worse although this not entirely clear. wound have a doctor examine the breasts to exclude anything more serious especially if a family history of breast cancer.
i am a breast cancer survivor. i completed radiation in december and started tamoxifen. i have had hip pain along the iliac crest for a few weeks. m?
would suggest that you inform your treating oncologist. persistent bone pain should always be further investigated in a patient with your history.
if b-cell lymphoma is found in a breast biopsy is that breast cancer?
common breast cancer derives from the glands and/or ducts of the breast. a few unusual sarcomas arise from the stroma of the breast. a lymphoma in the breast will behave like a lymphoma arising in the lymph nodes or wherever and treatment will not be given as if it were a common breast cancer.
i'm 31 yrs old been diagnosed with stage 4 breast cancer can i still engage in intercourse?
i am so sorry to hear this. however i know of no contraindication to sexual activity as long as you are physically comfortable with it. take care.
i'm 31 yrs old been diagnosed with stage 4 breast cancer can i still engage in intercourse?
i do not see a reason why you cannot. i am very sorry to hear about your diagnosis. stay strong and keep your thoughts positive.
i'm 31 yrs old been diagnosed with stage 4 breast cancer can i still engage in intercourse?
if you (and your partner) are in the mood and your breast cancer does not cause you too much discomfort there should not be any contraindication to your "engaging in intercourse" whether genito-sexual intercourse or any other intercourse/sexual activities that are enjoyable to you.
if breast cancer for a male goes unattended for 8 years. would he experience sickness and symptons? breast pain?
it is highly unlikely that you have had breast cancer for 8 years without getting symptoms. a male with breast cancer of 8 years duration will have sickness and symptoms. consult this site for info on this topic: <link>
i'm 16 for days my left breast has been hurting a lot is just painful. is it breast cancer?
please let your parent's know. any lumps?
just diagnosed with breast carcinoma. had many questions on the way home but doctor is gone now. can you tell me about the condition?
breast cancer like most cancers are conditions in which ductal or other cells multiple and divide more rapidly than normal. it can "spread" to lymph nodes blood bone liver and brain if not caught early and treated. there are many causes such as radiation to the breast. smokers have a higher risk. make a list of your questions for your next doctor;s visit and ask permission to tape record answers.
just diagnosed with triple negative breast cancer. is it one of worst kinds.
while triple negative is more resistant to treatment your prognosis still depends on the stage of the cancer.
just diagnosed with triple negative breast cancer. is it one of worst kinds.
i am sorry to her that you were just diagnosed with cancer. triple-negative breast cancer is defined by absent expression of the estrogen receptor [er] progesterone receptor [pr] and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (her2). these cancers tend to behave more aggressively (grow faster) than other types of breast cancer. it is still treatable.
just diagnosed with triple negative breast cancer. is it one of worst kinds.
triple negative cancers (those that do not express estrogen receptors progesterone receptors or her-2 neu) tend to behave more aggressive than those that do. that said there are other factors that will also affect your prognosis such as stage general health and such. do not lose faith cathy. best to you.
just diagnosis with ra after breast cancer new systom is itching at night at knuckles i just started methotrexate 2. 5 x 6?
psoriatic arthritis and ra virtually never co-exist if one has psoriasis and an inflammatory arthritis it is psoriatic arthritis. i doubt psoriasis if you have well documented ra. let a dermatologist look at a rash if one is present one not just an itching sensation. the one exception is psoriasis can be a complication of tnf therapy.
just diagnosis with ra after breast cancer new systom is itching at night at knuckles i just started methotrexate 2. 5 x 6?
on occasion ra may exist with psoriatic arthritis that is more typical if having skin plaques. discuss the diagnosis with your physician.
just got diagnosed with breast cancer a week ago how could this have happened?
there has been an increased incidence of breast cancer diagnosis in women younger than 40 in the us. there are many risk factors involved but you should get genetic counseling to make sure you are not carying a gene called brca 1/2.
just got told my mom has breast cancer. what is the best way to treat this?
there are many options depending on the type of breast cancer. your mother needs to discuss all treatment options with her physicians and surgeons.
just got told my mom has breast cancer. what is the best way to treat this?
the treatment depends on several things. she will need a consult with a breast surgeon and an oncologist. there are many types of breast cancer and the treatment will vary depending on what type and what stage she has. surgery radiation and chemotherapy may all be in her future. other tests like pet/ct scans and sentinel node testing will help with staging. many women do very well these days.
just had my 4th blood test for elevated ast & alt since 3/13. alt 101. ast 58. 3 yrs from breast cancer &on tamoxifen. shd i be getting some tests?
with the info provided. are they high but stable or are they progressively going up? what other meds you take? any concerning symptom? in a way you are getting tests your doc has opted to follow up your lfts periodically. i think you need to voice your concerns to him/her so that he/she goes over this and the future plan of attack. best to you.
just had my 4th blood test for elevated ast & alt since 3/13. alt 101. ast 58. 3 yrs from breast cancer &on tamoxifen. shd i be getting some tests?
have you had any imaging? u/s? ct abdomen? could try holding tamoxifen and seeing if lft's clear. imaging may also help clarify/ has hepatitis screen (blood work) done?
just had an an abortion and i heard one is at risk of breast cancer due to this. please how do i know?
while it is protective for women to have full term births particularly at a young age having an abortion does not necessarily increase the risk of breast cancer. it also may depend on what method of abortion was used. interruption of menstruation overall by carrying babies to full term is what seems to decrease the risk due to decreased estrogen during pregnancy.
just found out my multivitamin containd dong quai. will this cause breast cancer?
i agree that it is unlikely that dong quai can cause breast cancer but term studies in humans have not been done. it has some effect on estrogen but it is not clear what that is. it also may increase your bleeding risk and contains an oil that is known to be carcinogenic. there are many different preparations and doses so it can be difficult to know if you will experience any side effects.
just found out my multivitamin containd dong quai. will this cause breast cancer?
you can not create breast cancer so easily even if you tried. so there is nothing to worry about it.
just diagnosed with grade 2 breast cancer. wondering how bad it is and if chemo will be necessary.
good chance of beating the cancer. 1) surgery to remove tumor. go to a center where they can check hormone receptors er her2 etc. 2)sentinal node biopsy if negative may avoid chemotherapy. 3) hormone suppression eg: tamoxifen very useful depending on receptors. if chemotherapy or radiotherapy needed go for it. very safe these days. good luck.
just diagnosed with grade 2 breast cancer. wondering how bad it is and if chemo will be necessary.
grade 2 breast cancer still early you still have a good chance for cure chemotherapy might be needed your oncologist will decide that based on the presence of cancer in the lymph nodes and the the cancer behavior if it is aggressive or not and the hormone receptors result all these factors will help the oncologist decided if and what kind of chemotherapy and hormonal therapy is needed. good luck
lump in right breast i am three weeks from my due date and found a small hard ball like lump in my right breast right next to my nipple. i am hoping it is just an infected glan and not breast cancer. any way to find out before giving birth because i do de
i would obtain an ultrasound. i would never assume a lump is a 'plugged milk duct'. pregnant women are treated the same as those who are not pregnant. especially so close to due date even a mammogram could be done if absolutely necessary.

please see your gynecologist and have them evaluate the lump. it could be from milk-duct tissue but a more serious cause needs to be ruled out. you will most likely be able to breast feed but please see your gynecologist immediately. if you develop redness pain or fever then you would have to go to the er.
lump on right breast hurts! do i go to er this weekend?
if this is a new lump and especially if you have risk factors like a family history of breast cancer or the use of estrogens then you should have this evaluated quickly but it is not an emergency. you should see your ob gyn or family doctor and initiate the process.
large lump under armpit skin. had mammogram 9mo ago. should i repeat?
large axillary nodes can be from many causes other than breast cancer. infections lymphoma and breast cancer are a few causes. large axillary ln should be examined by your doctor and if clinically suspicious for neoplasm they should be biopsied. repeat mammography may or may not be needed.
long term effects of radiation therapy for breast cancer vs surgery?
long term effects of radiation therapy for breast cancer include: radiation fibrosis of lung lymphedema of the affected side upper extremity myocardial injury hypothyroidism brachial plexus injury risk of second neoplasm (radiation induced malignancy).
long term effects of radiation therapy for breast cancer vs surgery?
if you mean lumpectomy + radiation - the main side effects are some shrinkage of the breast in most cases and some firmness. some patients have occasional breast pain but usually not too bad. if the nodes inn the armpit are removed swelling of the arm may be a possibility.
long term effects of radiation therapy for breast cancer vs surgery?
long term side effects from breast radiation are much less likely with modern techniques today as opposed to techniques used just nine or ten years ago. it also depends on the doctors skill sets and equipment. it also depends upon whether or not the xrt is only to the breast or also needs i include the lymph nodes under arm and above collar bone. mostly cosmetic with increased density of breast.
long term effects of chemotherapy for breast cancer vs radiation?
chemotherapy long-term can increase the likelihood of developing bloodstream cancers such as leukemia radiation treatment can cause tissue scarring and also increase the possibilty of developing other cancers such as sarcoma.
lumps in my breasts. could this possibly be fibrocystic disease or something else?
yes it could be normal breast morphology. on the therhand it could be fibrocystic disease fibroadenoma or more seriously breast cancer to name a few. your age is a factor the quality of the lump the mobility of the lump skin texture and some other factors. you should have your breast evaluated by your md and possibly get an ultrasound or mammogram.
lwhat is age for breast cancer anid what are diagnostic procedures?
it's not common before age 30 but no one is immune. many more women than man. there's almost always a mass; despite the huge mammogram promotion you still will do well to check yourself at the same time each month. the huge majority of breast cancers get cured if found early i. e. by you. good luck.
lump in between the xyphoid process and my rib cage. is this breast cancer?
no one can tell you for sure without a biopsy. first it would be important to know how big the lump is how long it has been there and whether it has changed in size or not over time. any personal or family history of breast cancer would also be important to know. a fine needle or core biopsy of the lump will make the diagnosis but before that a mammogram would be recommended.
lump in between the xyphoid process and my rib cage. is this breast cancer?
i think what we call costochondritis. read about it. <link>
lump in between the xyphoid process and my rib cage. is this breast cancer?
it is best if you are examined by either your ob/gyn or your pcp or a surgeon. it is an unusual location but is possible best option is for a physical exam and some imaging like an us. when was your last mammogram and physical exam?
lump in bet. xyphoid process and rib cage? could this be breast cancer?
you should be examined by one of your physicians and also get some basic imaging like an ultrasound.
lump in bet. xyphoid process and rib cage? could this be breast cancer?
unlikely unless you had a previous personal history of if it or a extensive family history of breast cancer. definitely get it examined by your family physician.
left breast started hurting found dime sized knot near armpit was told breast cancer doesn't hurt is this true? what else could it be?
any new lump in the breast should be a cause for concern best handled by seeing your gyne or primary care doctor. while most cancers are not painful it is not a reliable finding. hopefully your doctor will be able to alleviate your concern or refer you to a breast center/surgeon for definitive evaluation. i hope its a false alarm--good luck.
left breast started hurting found dime sized knot near armpit was told breast cancer doesn't hurt is this true? what else could it be?
it is true that most breast cancers are painless in the primary site. there can be exceptions. more likely a newly discovered "lump" that is painful is a lymph node that is expanded in response to an infection. however to be sure you should see your physician promptly.
left breast started hurting found dime sized knot near armpit was told breast cancer doesn't hurt is this true? what else could it be?
most but not all breast cancers "don't hurt. " but any new change in your breast should be evaluated by your primary doctor or gynecologist. a new change in the breast that hurts could be an abscess or an infected cyst and with luck that's all but don't let new findings like this go by without evaluation.
left breast is larger than normal w/ pain. had mammo/sonogram found small cyst told to come back in 6 mos. breast noticeably larger now. causes?
please go get it checked again. i have had pts who had mamm us one month and a month or two later noticed a change in their breast that was of course cancer. it did not show up on mam/us. one out of three breast cancers won't show up on anything except exam. go back and see your md. better to be a worry wart or pest than to miss a breast cancer!
lcis- diagnosed 6 mos ago & had a lumpectomy. now 6 mos later they have found a different area & the biopsy shows it is lcis also. recommendations?
lcis is a marker for future breast cancer. you need a full risk assessment includes detailed family history and possible brca testing. i highly recommend an mri. you need a high risk evaluation that should include a recommendation for a hormonal agent (like tamoxifen) to help decrease your risk of developing a breast cancer. take time to explore all options with a breast specialist.
left breast cancer in 2004 stage 2 hormone+. feb 2013 mammo triang shaped nodule in right breast typical of benign lesion as lymph node. take it out?
male breast cancer is not common. if your mammogram shows something there- i would pursue further with sonogram of the breast to evaluate more on the nodule. if it is suspicious- i would do a biopsy and will go from there.
lump under arm and sore nipple could this be a sigh of breast cancer?
possibly. you should be evaluated asap by your doctor to rule out a malignancy.
lump under arm and sore nipple could this be a sigh of breast cancer?
and plan for the worst. this is probably just an inflammation of your breast. maybe an infection. it is not a typical presentation of breast cancer. so you do have to see a doctor within the next couple of weeks but try not to stress too much while proving that this is nothing.
lisa(54) due for 2nd round of chemo(1st round very hard on her) and has fractured her leg; is it advisable to delay treatment(stage 3 breast cancer)?
only your oncologist can give you the answer. it all depends on the type of breast cancer and the treatment being given and other factors in your medical history.
lisa(54) due for 2nd round of chemo(1st round very hard on her) and has fractured her leg; is it advisable to delay treatment(stage 3 breast cancer)?
a delay of one or two weeks in giving chemo does not matter. but most bone fractures start healing in 2 weeks so i would not advise interrupting chemo for more than 2 weeks especially if it is a very large tumor. sometimes we can substitute hormones or herceptin (trastuzumab) depending on which type of breast cancer(hormone receptor positive? her2 positive? ) you have.
lisa(54) due for 2nd round of chemo(1st round very hard on her) and has fractured her leg; is it advisable to delay treatment(stage 3 breast cancer)?
what is the cause of the fracture? was it due to a fall or trauma or because there is weak area in the bone due to spread of the cancer? the fracture must be stabilized so that lisa can be as mobile as possible to prevent blood clots. people with cancer are at increased for blood clot. the orthopedic oncologist can then consult with the oncologist as to optimum time for cancer treatment.
lump on breast disappeared/decreased in size after miscarriage. pregnant again @17w lump's back. i have fibrocystic breasts. could this be hormonal?
you should talk to your obstetrician about this. while breast changes can be normal in pregnancy some women are diagnosed with breast cancer while pregnant. you should see your doctor for an exam and diagnosis. don't delay. good luck.
large painful lump near nipple. waiting for mammogram. night sweats fever for 10 days. what are the chances this is breast cancer. can't sleep?
if you are breastfeeding it maybe a breast abscess. symptoms include painful local swelling + breast lump redness & tenderness of the breast. in non-lactating women subareolar breast abscess may develop representing an infected lump just under the areola. inflammatory breast cancer is much less likely but you should definitely get an ultrasound and possibly a mammogram (if not breastfeeding).
large painful lump near nipple. waiting for mammogram. night sweats fever for 10 days. what are the chances this is breast cancer. can't sleep?
you need to see your doctor. it seems that you might developed an abscess and need drained and antibiotics prescribed. forget mammogram for now it's not going to do you any good.
lumps in breasts am that hurt when pushed on? . hx fibrocystic breasts.
breast lumps that are tender with a history of fibrocystic diseases are likely just that. typically they vary in size and degree of tenderness with hormone fluctuations caffeine intake etc. unusual lumps or persistent tender areas should be checked to be sure. also if family history of breast cancer always best to err on side of getting checked.
left arm numb shoulder and kinda pain in my cheest what it can be pinched nerve? i'm woried of can be any sing of breast cancer
see er for cardiac workup asap
left breast lump found on bse; had mammogram followed by u/s. complex cyst w/debri (5mm) identified. told to have repeat mammogram in 1 year but how do i know for sure the "debri" isn't worrisome? should i get 2nd opinion or request biopsy?
given that your age does put you at risk for breast cancer unfortunately with or without a family history of such a second opinion wouldn't hurt. complex cysts are a bit more worrisome than simple cysts as they have some contents. i wouldn't panic right now but a second opinion or a breast mri wouldn't be a bad idea.
my mum had a breast cancer 2 years ago. she now suffers from sever cramping in legs and even toes. is this normal?
doctors recommend compression devices as first line therapy to control swelling. ice packs leg elevation increase oral hydration add electrolytes (tea gatorade) before bed. walk briskly before bed. massage legs feet and toes. ok to ask for imaging to evaluate for arterial insufficiency. be well.
my mum had a breast cancer 2 years ago. she now suffers from sever cramping in legs and even toes. is this normal?
you mum needs to be evaluated for leg cramps. it's unlikely to have anything to do with breast cancer but it's better to be safe than sorry.
my wbc is 1. 6. my spleen is ok and breast cancer runs in my family. i do daycare and have been able to fight off illnesses. what does this mean? i
various reasons brings it down such as viral illness bone marrrow diseases autoimmune illnesses some kind of medications etc. see a hematologist.
mom has a breast cancer but it got to the liver ( the liver is functional) the dr called it stage 4 or metastasis is what she has called breast canc?
it is a metastatic breast cancer. breast cancer is the original cancer it could be inherited. there is a lot of tests now that they can determined the risk for every relative and the best way to prevent and avoid breast cancer.
metastatis breast cancer stage iv. what are the chances of survival. already gone six sittings of chemo.
need more information. where the metastases are. only bone metastases do better than soft tissue metastases. what is the er an pr what is the her2 status. there are many treatments available now. keep fighting and you will win.
metastatis breast cancer stage iv. what are the chances of survival. already gone six sittings of chemo.
sadly in general metastatic breast cancer is ultimately deadly. how long each person lives varies greatly. once the cancer gets into soft tissue organs such as lung liver or brain the life expectancy is generally very short a year or less. however there have been some advances in recent years that allow patients to live longer in some cases.
metastatis breast cancer stage iv. what are the chances of survival. already gone six sittings of chemo.
gosh! i'm sorry you're sick! not as sorry as you i know. it is good to ask questions. in this case we don't know enough. what type of breast cancer do you have? do you have any other medical problems? are you tolerating the chemo? these questions all affect survival. so does "luck. " talk to your docs if they haven't given you this information clearly. have questions written down. take notes
my mom is going thru chemo after lumpectomy she noticed a lump in her other breast recently which showed probably benign in her mamo is this a worry?
it is and it isn't. if it wasn't there on her initial mammogram or the one with which she was first diagnosed with breast cancer then it has grown despite being on chemo and it is absolutely worrisome and should be biopsied. if it has been there all along and hasn't changed then it is likely not of concern
mammo shows heterogeneously dense breasts birads 2 benign finding what does then mean heterogeneously dense breast?
the breast tissue density among women is quite variable and ranges from dense to lucent and any degree of mixed forms(that is what heterogeneous means as opposed to homogeneous). the breast that is very dense can sometimes hide a small breast cancer. that is why such women are advised to have examination with an ultrasound in addition to mammography. you do not seem to have that problem.
my mums had 2 separate breast cancers 1 a lumpectomy the other was a full mastectomy my cousin also died of breast cancer shud i get checked out?
guidelines for screening mammograms in standard risk women (without a strong family history of breast cancer) recommend that mammograms begin between age 40 and 50 depending on the woman's preference. screening starts earlier in higher risk situation such as with a family history. in this situation i would not recommend waiting until age 50. family medicine women's health or ob/gyn can help
my mums had 2 separate breast cancers 1 a lumpectomy the other was a full mastectomy my cousin also died of breast cancer shud i get checked out?
people with a family history of breast cancer are at more risk for having breast cancer themselves. this type of cancer can manifest rapidly and can metastasize very fast. your doctor will want a baseline exam for you before you have any problems so that when you do he can compare to the baseline. don't wait. go now!
multiple hypoechoic nodules with benign features in both breasts. sometimes hurting. should i have anything to be worried about and have it removed?
talk to a general surgeon. most likely you have fibrocystic breast disease which is commonly confused with breast cancer (even by trained professionals) - but in your case correctly determined to be "benign". a surgeon may be able to remove some of the cysts but they may return. talk to a surgeon about options for removal a doctor about other treatments (heating pads nsaids like naproxen &c)
my grandmother had breast cancer and my grandfather passed from sarcoma both before the age of 40 (both dad's side) would i benefit from brca testing?
having a second degree relative like a grandmother with breast cancer before the age of 40 is a red flag for possible brca. if your grandmother is living then she could be tested. if not then your mother or father could be tested depending on which side of the family. if they do not have the gene then they cannot pass it on to you. hope this helps.
my grandmother had breast cancer and my grandfather passed from sarcoma both before the age of 40 (both dad's side) would i benefit from brca testing?
is recommended before and after any genetic test. this counseling is provided by a doctor who is experienced in cancer genetics.
my grandmother had breast cancer and my grandfather passed from sarcoma both before the age of 40 (both dad's side) would i benefit from brca testing?
so sorry to hear that. there is a formula that your pcp can go through with you to calculate your risk. unless your grandmother had an early breast cancer younger than 40 it probably won't increase your risk of hereditary cancer. 90% of breast cancers are not brca cancers. typically there is a history of several breast cancers in first degree relatives and early breast cancer.
my mom is 47 she recently felt lump on her breast and ovaries bleeding. what could it be? no family history of breast cancer.
mammogram first the if needed biopsy to know. .
my 90 y/o great grandma was just diagnosed with breast cancer and my 17 y/o sister is worried that one of us might get it or another cancer. i'm male.
breast cancer does develop in some members of a family but the hereditary breast cancer is rare(affecting less than i 1 in 10 cases of breast cancer in general. moreover breast cancer is fairly common cancer in the older females affecting about 1 in 8 women. so your suister has to think positive and not worry at the present time. breast cancer is easy to diagnoses and is highly curable(>80% cured)
my 90 y/o great grandma was just diagnosed with breast cancer and my 17 y/o sister is worried that one of us might get it or another cancer. i'm male.
congenital br ca not present if one member develops ca. if several members involved then genetic testing needed. 90% of breast cancers are environmentally caused such as by mmtv virus. male members of exposed family rarely get breast ca but may acquire it if a genetic problem in family. females acquiring breast ca have incidence of 1 in 7 although for males much lower.

lillian most oncologists will stop the herceptin (trastuzumab) if they see a drop in the ef. then resume it after ensuring some improvement in function. her surgeon and cardiologist will help guide when it is safe to proceed as some patients can proceed with lumpectomy and sentinel node procedures with the lower ef. best wishes for recovery to your mother.

my mother had breast cancer and metastasis into brain. she has completed imrt radiation theraphy (16 sittings) 3 weeks before. i recently came to know about srs-gammaknife radio surgery for brain which is effective than normal rt. pls need details.
brain mets represents late stage disease if solitary then resection can be tried or if large lesion shrinks with imrt then resection may be tried. when lesion is solitary then best rt is gamma knife which is high intensity low dose volume at about 2-3 cm. for larger lesion the high intensity localized rt is known as cyberknife delivered in a rotation system in which the patient is centered.
my mother had breast cancer and metastasis into brain. she has completed imrt radiation theraphy (16 sittings) 3 weeks before. i recently came to know about srs-gammaknife radio surgery for brain which is effective than normal rt. pls need details.
both are useful for different situations depending on the number size and location of the lesions. sometimes may be difficult to compare the roles without looking at the scans
my mother had breast cancer and metastasis into brain. she has completed imrt radiation theraphy (16 sittings) 3 weeks before. i recently came to know about srs-gammaknife radio surgery for brain which is effective than normal rt. pls need details.
stereotactic radiosurgery otherwise know as gammaknife cyberknife etc. is highly effective and in many ways safer treatment than imrt radiation therapy. but it cannot be used on everyone and depends on the numbers of metastasis and the size of them. if the tumors are bigger than 3 cm and/or numerous than srs is not recommended.
my mom my grandma and my mom's sister all had breast cancer (and died). i was told that mastectomy reduce the risks for me. is that true?
breast cancer is a genetic disease. in 5-10% of cases it runs in the family. that seems to be the case here. this is what angelina jolie had(it is called br-ca positive breast cancer). removal of both breasts before cancer develops is one good solution for this type of breast cancer. your doctor can easily run the braca test for you and a genetic counselor can further guide you in this regard.
my dr just put me on 1mg arimidex (anastrozole) once a day for gynecomastia. can. you tell me more about this medication and the dose i am taking?
this is anti estrogen medication anti female hormone usually given to a female with breast cancer that was tested positive for hormones receptors. i personally never used it for your diagnosis. i will get a local second opinion before i use it. unless he is confidant that your problem is driven by increase hormone of estrogen most make gyncomastia are not. it usually start in puberty
my dr just put me on 1mg arimidex (anastrozole) once a day for gynecomastia. can. you tell me more about this medication and the dose i am taking?
it blocks estrogen. as such it will lower all estrogen effects. it isnt generally used for this and was developed for breast cancer but it is a hormone blocker of a hormone a male doesnt need not a chemotherapy drug. and there is the question of why one has it. it isnt that rare to just have it with puberty. hormones are all high and that can be it. but hormones can be unregulated in diseases.
my mom has had breast cancer 3 times and was first diagnosed at 37. she got it again after total mastectomy. she is neg for the gene am i neg too?
"the gene" that everyone thinks of with breast cancer is the brca gene. if she doesn't have that gene then you cannot inherit it from her. but unfortunately there are many genes linked with breast cancer now and you may want to go with your mother to a genetic counselor to discuss her testing options. also you can visit www. getcolor. com to learn more about gene testing.
male 56 for months i've had mild pain on left nipple. recently increased to sharp pain; mamm/u. s. both negative. pain still increasing. what 2 check?
1. paget's disease of the nipple - this occurs when externally invisible cancer inside the breast spreads to the nipple and areola area. the areolar area looks as if it has been infected. it looks red swollen and is painful but actually this is caused by blockage of small channels called lymphatics which drain the fluid from the areolar area. this blockage is caused by rapid proliferation of cancer cells within the breast tissue. sometimes the breast cancer may not be apparent even on a mammography. 2. it could also be caused by allergies or sensitivities to various detergents soaps weather fabric etc. some women are sensitive to the plastics in breast shells nipple shields and pump flanges. 3. repeated friction like say prolonged exercise or jogging. 4. vigorous sexual activity could be a cause. 5. infections of the breast has to be ruled out. infections could lodge on already traumatized nipples. diabetes is another risk factor for skin infections because micro-organisms love the sugary cells in people with diabetes. nipple pain with fever is once reason you should visit the doctor because of the concern for infections.
mother is 87 suffering from dementia after an infection put her in the hospital in 2013. does it make sense to continue mammograms in her state?
there comes a point where at a certain age and acquisition of a chronic dementia one should focus upon palliative comfort support and start to come to terms with our fond past memories and cherish the prior years. it makes no sense to perform monitor testing for potential breast cancer at this point.
my father is 62 yr old. he has 4 sisters. 3 of them r above 50 found to have breast cancer. ( heriditary) how much possibility does my father have
breast cancers due to brca gene malformation in females will lso affect men if they inherit other forms of cancers like prostate cancer. you also will need genetic counseling and tests.
my father is 62 yr old. he has 4 sisters. 3 of them r above 50 found to have breast cancer. ( heriditary) how much possibility does my father have?
is rare even with positive family history but risk is not zero. he should be seen annually by a doctor for careful physical exam given his family history.
my daughter has uneven breasts and strange markings on the upper left side of her left breast. could this be a sign of breast cancer?
it is not unusual for young women to have some asymmetry or unevenness as they develop. some will go on to deal with this after puberty if the smaller side does not fill in. surface markings at that age represent skin issues not deeper breast issues. the more common are stria or stretch markings. her regular primary care doc is a good place to start.
my daughter has uneven breasts and strange markings on the upper left side of her left breast. could this be a sign of breast cancer?
probably skin abnormality. the possibility of breast cancer at her age is near nil.
mammogram doubts neoplastic process scan shows well lobulated solid mass wider than taller family history of 2 sis of breast cancer. d/d plz?
like you had a breast ultrasound as well. obviously limited info and incomplete description but based on those descriptors it is probably a birads category 3 lesion(98% or greater chance of being benign). most commonly a mass with this description is a benign fibroadenoma.
my mums oncologist is pretty certain that nodules that they have seen in the lung and kidneys are secondary breast cancer. possible in kidneys?
unfortunately secondaries can occur in all organs including kidneys.
my nana & my great aunt had breast cancer and another great aunt had ovarian cancer. what are the chances of me getting cancer in my life?
breast ovarian and colon cancer are all located on the brca gene and is transmitted through family members. have your md perform brca gen testing to see if you are a candidate for that type of cancer inheritance.
my mother had lobular breast cancer at 53. does this mean ill get it? is the lobular variety more likely genetic? i'm brca negative.
the lobular variety has similar genetic risk as other varieties. your mother having breast cancer does mean you have greater than average risk but it is still much more likely that you won't get it than you will. many genes besides brca affect risk but diet and lifestyle still has a greater influence on risk than genetics. see <link> and <link>
mum has to go for breast scan on tender lump no family history of breast cancer. what are the chances of it being cancer? so worried.
most breast lumps(80%) are benign. so you should wait to worry till the doctor has examined her and has run a mammogram(an x-rays of the breast) to find out the nature of this lump.
my mother s 52 yrs post menopausal lady she had periductal mastitis before 1month and resolved with antibiotics bt there s residual thickening?
it may take 3-6 weeks for the thickening to gto away but i have also seen this happen with inflammatory breast cancer- a mammogram would be in order
mothers mom had pancreatic cancer at 72 dad had colon at 87 she had had lobular breast cancer at 54. i've had brca testing- negative. am i at risk?
keep up surveillance like everybody else and good luck.
mothers mom had pancreatic cancer at 72 dad had colon at 87 she had had lobular breast cancer at 54. i've had brca testing- negative. am i at risk?
there is some risk even though you don't have the brca gene mutation. if your own parents instead of your grandparents had these diseases your risk would be greater. a geneticist can advise you better however.
mothers mom had pancreatic cancer at 72 dad had colon at 87 she had had lobular breast cancer at 54. i've had brca testing- negative. am i at risk?
with the negative brca tests your risk of these is much lower. they may identify other genetic tumor markers for these as time goes on. remember the majority of colon cancer is found in persons without a family history for it.
my sister was just diagnosed with infiltrating duct carcinoma grade 2 in breast tumor 1. 8cm and adenocarcinoma in the lymph node 3. 1cm is this serious?
and she needs to follow up with her oncologist breast cancer treatment has advanced a great deal and cure is possible wish you both wellness
my right breast feels heavy especially when i remove my bra and sometimes hurts when i bend over. could this be a sign of breast cancer?
any breast change requires further medical evaluation. call your pcp for appt on monday.
my mom had been diagonsed with breast cancer chest wall recurrence and surgery had been done and lump had been removed.
tell us what is your question? we need to know her age and the dates of her surgery and date of her breast cancer recurrence. then we can guide you further. what did herr doctor advise you to do?
my aunt is a breast cancer survivor and lost most of her hair. it's thin and she's african american. how can she grow back her hair?
most of the time hair will grow back in couple of months after treatment unfortunately the chemo. that killed cancer cell also will kill the hair follicle then badness will be permanent. think alternative lucky she survied the cruel disease.
nonpalpable breast tumor shows up on ultrasound so does that makeprognosis worse?
the prognosis for your breast cancer depends on the tumor's size its markers (er pr her2) its grade and how far it has spread. being able to see a tumor on ultrasound means it is big enough to see but that's all. it doesn't mean anything for your prognosis good or bad. i think the hardest time during a breast cancer diagnosis is waiting to get all the information. hang in there!
nonpalpable breast tumor shows up on ultrasound so does that makeprognosis worse?
mass cannot be felt or seen on mammography it tends to grow larger before it is found and this correlates with invasive lobular carcinoma that accounts for about 15% of breast cancer. these are usually found later called "puff balls" like cotton under skin and are best seen by u/s.
new group /cluster of suspicious microcalifications upper outer quadrant middle depth linear -oriented in breast. concerned? breast cancer?
a mammogram is very good in picking up calcifications. the appearance of new calcifications or a change from what was seen previously especially if the configuration is "pleomorphic" or different size and shapes can raise suspicion for cancer and should be followed by a biopsy. some breast centers will perform an ultrasound to determine if there is a mass associated with the calcifications.
new group /cluster of suspicious microcalifications upper outer quadrant middle depth linear -oriented in breast. concerned? breast cancer?
any new microcalcification in breast should be treated with care. any question then biopsy should be consider.
new group /cluster of suspicious microcalifications upper outer quadrant middle depth linear -oriented in breast. concerned? breast cancer?
if the calcifications are new or suspicious then stereotactic biopsy is indicated to make a tissue diagnosis.
new group /cluster of suspicious microcalifications upper outer quadrant middle depth linear -oriented in breast. concerned? breast cancer?
if the calcifications are new or suspicious appearing then a stereotactic needle biopsy is indicated to make a tissue diagnosis.
new group /cluster of suspicious microcalifications upper outer quadrant middle depth linear -oriented in breast. concerned? breast cancer?
biopsy recommended. suspicious microcalcifications warrant tissue diagnosis via non-surgical biopsy to determine if they are cancerous. thankfully they are more often benign than malignant. good luck.
new group /cluster of suspicious microcalifications upper outer quadrant middle depth linear -oriented in breast. concerned? breast cancer?
microcalcifications are most commonly seen with fibrocystic breast disease. when found we always do a biopsy because there is about a 10 % chance it could be a breast cancer.
never been pregnant always had white spots on my nipples and areola. down side is breast cancer runs in the family. should i be worried?
white spots on the nipples and areola are called montgomery tubercles and are normal.
never been pregnant always had white spots on my nipples and areola. down side is breast cancer runs in the family. should i be worried?
but if there is a family history of br ca you may need closer surveillance. the spots are likely just areas with less pigment.
need expert advice on any information on treatment for triple negative stage 4 breast cancer?
triple negative is a more aggressive form of breast cancer especially in younger women. it can be difficult (though not impossible) to treat. i recommend consulting with your medical oncologist for options. you may want to get a 2nd opinion at a university hospital for clinical trials. here is a good site: <link> keep positive and follow through with treatments.
need advice on what is the the difference between lymph nodes and breast cancer?
are normal structures in the body involved in lymphatic drainage and body immunity. breast cancer is a neoplasm which can spread through the body using the lymphatic channels. if it does the cancer can cause the regional lymph nodes to be involved with cancer and enlarge.
natural breast cancer remedies? i learned that estrogen-receptor blockers treat cancer but what are some er blockers?

need expert opinion: are the risks of mammograms worth the benefit?
the data have shown that mammography saves lives but that the surveillance does result in a fairly large percentage of biopsies for benign conditions which is to be expected in a population-wide screening process that attempts to ensure that all "true positives" for breast cancer are caught. read more about mammography here: <link>
need doctor advice. where do they inject the needle when you get a breast cancer shot?
i am not sure what type of "shot" you mean. chemotherapy is given intravenous usually through a vein in the arm or hand. sometimes internal ports are placed into a major vein if chemotherapy is expected to be needed over a longer time. other types of "shots" may be injected into the arm or buttock muscle.
non calcified lung nodule brac1+ history of breast ca in 08 bilat mastectomy is this nodule ca? enlarged lymph in neck and axil. hoarse
the finding of a nodule following a malignancy that typically spreads to the lung like breast cancer is concerning especially with lymphatic symptoms. the size of the nodule is important to prognosticate and to determine which diagnostic modality would be best. this would be best managed by coordination of care between the oncologist radiologist and pulmonologist.
non calcified lung nodule brac1+ history of breast ca in 08 bilat mastectomy is this nodule ca? enlarged lymph in neck and axil. hoarse
a history of breast cancer raises your risk of recurrence disease. enlarged lymph nodes are also worrisome. you need a biopsy asap--likely a lymph node since they can be readily biopsied with local anesthesia. if lymph nodes (+) presumption would be that the lung is related to the breast lesion. if lymph nodes (-) you would then need a lung biopsy. you also need a pet scan.

need expert opinions about skin cancer breast cancer lung cancer etc. why does cancer attack a specific part of someone's body?
the dna of any cell may mutate and continue to replicate with no end to it. the ability of cells to multiply and differentiate is expressed in the growth of a baby in 9months from a fertilized ovarian cell. from 1cell to a 9-10pound baby in 9months. that ability is in every cell of the body. if the off switch for cell division is lost cells of any type may replicate indefinitely.
need expert opinions about skin cancer breast cancer lung cancer etc. why does cancer attack a specific part of someone's body?
cancer is not an "attack" by an alien creature like a microbe. cancer develops in any organ in which there are dividing cells when enough mutations have accumulated in a clone of cells to destabilize the genome. even in the 21st century most people do not understand how "cancer is not other it is us. " where it appears has to do with both risk factors (i. e. mutagen exposure) and dumb luck.

on balance is a moderate amount of alcohol good for you? it is both a risk for breast cancer in women and beneficial for heart disease.
each person needs to make his/her own decisions about that. most things in moderation are ok (exceptions: tobacco street drugs etc. ) i would not drink alcohol specifically for the health reasons but i seen no reason for the average person to avoid moderate amounts of alcohol if you already drink.

moderate alcohol as in 1 drink per day can be beneficial for the heart. studies have not shown that moderate amounts of alcohol leads to breast cancer. an excess of alcohol beyond 1 drink per day or 5 drinks per week is detrimental to one's health. red wine is popular for having most antioxidants and other nutritious factors but no matter what you drink moderation is key.

no one test can see everything. there are some types of bone lesions which are better seen on a bone scan while others are better seen on a pet scan. breast cancer can do either/both.
oct 2012-pet scan done with 2 areas of concern after breast cancer dx. had biopsy and bone scan that were both neg. all cancer treatment done and #2 pet showed same areas-no change. why bone scan?
pet not very helpful. if there is a suspicious bone lesion the solution is to biopsy it to prove malignancy or benignancy. radiology departments are usually asked to do this under ct-scan direction. a 'negative' biopsy needs to demonstrate that the needle was iin the correct location. after all is said and done an image can be falsely positive and followed.

it depends on the type of breast cancer. if positive for estrogen and/or progesterone receptors ("er" and "pr") there are other options though in some cases it may not be as good as taking these meds in conjunction with chemo. if stage 4 breast cancer there are many clinical trials. again it depends on the cancer stage and the markers er/pr and her2 from the cancer specimen.
please tell me what are other options besides chemotherapy for breast cancer?
chemo is used when breast cancer has metastasized around the body especially for tumors without hormone receptors (er/pr). it also is sometimes used to kill any microscopic cells that could grow in the future. tumors that have er/pr may sometimes be treated with hormone therapy instead. her2 positive tumors may often be treated with antibodies or pills that target her2 instead of or with chemo.

sentinel lymph node biopsy is a critical part of breast cancer surgery used to stage the cancer and therefore guide further therapy. a recent study has established that many women do not require further lymph node removal even if there is cancer in the sentinel node.
should i have a sentinel lymph node biopsy to find out if there is spread to the lymph nodes?
with any invasive breast cancer diagnosis nodal staging is usually indicated most often via sentinel node mapping/biopsy. if there are palpable nodes or abnormal nodes on axillary ultrasound they can be sampled via fna and if positive sentinel node biopsy is not necessary. slnbx is also usually done at the time of mastectomy for dcis in case invasive disease is found at final pathology.

hello. i don't have a diagnosis for your symptoms. most breast cancers aren't tender. i don't know if you are fair skinned or have had very much sun exposure. please check the mole for the following. this information comes directly from the american academy of dermatology. asymmetry: if the mole has asymmetry (one half is unlike the other half). border: the border is irregular scalloped or poorly defined. color: the color is varied and has shades of tan brown or black; is sometimes white red or blue. diameter: the diameter is more than 6 mm (the size of a pencil eraser). evolving: a mole or skin lesion that looks different from the rest or is changing in size shape or color. if you have an irregular mole that itches bleed or is painful that can be worrisome for possible skin cancer. you said it started discharging- dont' know if that means a purulent drainage. because you described it as large as a baloon with (purulent? ) drainage& swelling and you are experiencing weakness it would be prudent that this be evaluated at an er (especially if there is any fever). your description raises a number of concerns - this could be an abcess that has opened up and is draining or this could be a mole that has changed. because it could be an abcess and because it a breast lesion recommend that this be evaluated by a general surgeon.
