do you know of a way to relieve pain from venous ulcers?
venous ulcerations are usually due to chronic venous insufficiency secondary to refluxing venous valves in the saphenous or perforating systems of veins. once ulcers form they are difficult to heal and are painful. medication may help to control the pain but the best way to eradicate the pain is to heal the ulcer. you should see a vein specialist for a full venous evaluation including a sonogram.
what causes swelling in both ankles. came on suddenly. elevation does not seem to help. i'm 57 good health and very active. 35 lbs overweight
swelling in the lower legs unrelieved by elevation is consistent with chronic venous insufficiency. this is a normal progression of loss of calf function compression to the great saphenous vein. additionally watch your sodium intake -- where salt goes water follows! work more lower leg exercises to strengthen the calf muscles and see if that helps. wear compression socks in the meantime.
what kind of specialist should i seek if i have a lymphedema problem?
where you live either seeing a podiatrist or cardiologist who specializes in venous disease would be a good place to start. if it affects the lower legs it could be from chronic venous insufficiency and not so much lymphedema. if you recently had surgery or a mastectomy from breast cancer then lymphedema is the working problem. treatment is compression with a pneumatic compression pump.
is lymphedema common?
with chronic venous insufficiency. in cvi there is failure of the calf-pump system in which the calf doesn't compress the deep veins in the lower leg causing swelling. in lymphedema there is actual failure of the lymphatic vessels to appropriately drain fluid off the system causing pitting edema. in most cases patients sometimes have both.
please tell me anything you know about lymphedema?
lymphedema is usually a chronic problem and can have many causes. often times the primary cause may be unknown and this is called idiopathic. primary lymphedema can be congenital can occur in the teen age years or can occur in the over 40 year old group. secondary lymphedema is often related to surgery skin infections or commonly in relation to chronic venous insufficiency and leg swelling.

what are the risks of chronic venous insufficiency?
chronic venous insufficiency risks are symptomatic like pain and throbbing or physical like swelling inflammation dermatitis pigmentation and ulceration. also enlarged varicosities can encourage clot formation through stasis of blood flow.
what is the difference between deep vein thrombosis (dvt) and chronic veneous insufficiency (cvt) problems?
chronic venous insufficiency often results after suffering dvt. even if the blood clot is cleared out by the body's natural defenses the venous valves almost always become stuck to the walls of the veins and no longer prevent blood flow from traveling backward with gravity toward the legs and feet. this is what is called venous insufficiency.
what is the difference between chronic venous insufficiency and peripheral vascular disease?
pad involves disease of arteries. venous insufficiency is problem of veins with leaky valves.
what is the difference between chronic venous insufficiency and peripheral vascular disease?
peripheral vascular disease more recently referred to as peripheral arterial disease (pad) includes diseases that affect the delivery of blood to the extremities. veins return blood to the heart and lungs. chronic venous insufficiency when valves within the veins fail allowing blood to pool in the legs.
what is the difference between chronic venous insufficiency and peripheral vascular disease?
chronic venous insufficiency is disease of the veins. the veins bring blood back to the heart. peripheral vascular disease is also known as peripheral arterial disease. the arteries are vessels that take blood away from the heart. typically a person only suffers from one of these problems! the patients that suffer from both are more difficult to treat.
what is the difference between chronic venous insufficiency and peripheral vascular disease?
venous insufficiency is a disease of the vein which drains blood out of the legs. periferal vascular disease is a disease of the artery which delivers blood to the legs.
what is the difference between chronic venous insufficiency and peripheral vascular disease?
both involve vessels that carry blood. chronic venous insufficiency (cvi) affects veins peripheral vascular (arterial) disease (pad) affects arteries. both mean that blood isn't getting through the vessels properly. with cvi the problem is that the inside of the veins carrying the blood becomes too large. with pad the problem is the inside of the arteries carrying the blood becomes too small.
what does a sharp pain/ice cold sensation on a leg with chronic venous insufficiency mean that also gets worse upon touching?

what would make me feel like im freezing in 70 degree weather could it be another dvt i had 2 dvt in 2 and a half years
the symptoms of always feeling cold especially if accompanied by dry itchy skin brittle hair and feelings of sluggishness constipation and fatigue are characteristics of a low thyroid metabolism. these symptoms are best evaluated with a total t4 free t4 total t3 and free t3 and reverse t3 as well as a thyroid antiglobulin study ultrasound of the thyroid and a competent examination by a thyroid specialist or endocrinologist. what is more troubling from the venous point of view is your history of two episodes of dvt in 2 years. this is a very serious condition which can lead to long term disability from chronic venous insufficiency and or obstruction of the common femoral and or popliteal vein and may result in chronic leg swelling darkening of the skin at the ankle and chronic ulceration. this also also has the potential to travel up into the pelvic veins and even break off and be carried to the heart and lungs as a pulmonary embolus. i strongly suggest that you should see a phlebologist or another physician with special knowledge of dvt and clotting abnormalities and determine if you have a congential or acquired hyper coagulable state (thromobphilia condition) which predisposes to recurrent dvts. a series of blood tests (coagulopathy panel) can determine if you have inherited one or more of these genetic risk factors that might explain your problem: factor v leidin protein c protein s prothrombin g20210a mutation elevated factor viii antiphospholipid antibodies apc resistance antithrombin activity. lupus anticoagulant and hyperhomocyteinemia {mthr abonrmality}. other acquired predisposing factors include oral contraceptive and estrogen containing products undiagnosed occult malignancies and prior history of trauma to your veins or even chronic varicose veins. this is a complex problem and you should try to see a specialist either through your insurance plan or through a free clinic at a teaching hospital where duplex ultrasound and other resources can be used to assess the gravity of your condition. in the meantime if your leg is swollen and you do not have any arterial disease you may want to consider wearing a graduated elastic compression stocking (preferably thigh high) with a 20 to 30 or even a 30 to 30 mm hg gradient may give you some relief from the symptoms of swelling and this may help to prevent another episode of dvt. compression stockings stronger than 20 mm hg gradient should only be dispensed through a licensed professional. aspirin is not a sufficient preventative medicine and your specialist can advise you whether you may be better off considering life long anticoagulation or whether you condition doesn't merit these additional risks.

terminology can be confusing. there is venous insufficiency (vi) or venous reflux as dr. gotvald said and there is chronic venous insufficiency (cvi). cvi indicates that you have had severe reflux for a long time and there is already damage. on the other hand although reflux is genetically determined and no preventable if you have vi prevention of progression to cvi might be possible.
what is the trouble chronic venous insufficiency and what do people have to do to prevent it early on?
venous insufficiency or chronic venous reflux is a condition in which the valves within the veins are weak and defective allowing blood to stagnate or "pool" with the veins rather than flowing efficiently. this can be caused by a genetic problem with the valves or damage from blood clots. you can sometime prevent it through wearing support stockings and with regular exercise normal body weight.
what is the trouble chronic venous insufficiency and what do people have to do to prevent it early on?
veins return blood to the heart. cvi occurs when there is reduced flow or pooling in leg veins causing leg swelling inflammation & ulceration. the most common cause is when the one-way valves don't work well leading to venous reflux or back flow with blood pooling in the veins. this can result from genetic predisposition pregnancy injuries or blood clots. see a vein specialist for help.
what is chronic venous insufficiency? how do you get it?
chronic venous insufficiency is due to the back flow of blood in the veins usually in the lower extremities. back flow is usually protected by valves in the veins that become faulty over time allowing blood to pool. this increases the pressure of blood in the veins and fluid (and a small amount of blood) leaks into the tissues causing swelling pain inflammation and on the skin ulcerations.
what is chronic venous insufficiency? how do you get it?
drs. bolhack and zimmet have given very nice answers that i agree with. as far as the cause there are really two. the major cause is heredity causing venous valves to stop working properly and causing the back flow high pressure and inflammation that produces skin damage swelling and ulceration. the less common cause is post thrombotic resulting from a blood clot that causes valve damage.

what's chronic venous insufficiency?
chronic venous insufficiency is when veins do not pump enough oxygen-poor blood back to the heart. this is caused by the valves in the veins leaking or flowing backwards. it usually occurs in the leg. it can be caused by the deep veins leaking [ less common ] or the superficial veins leaking[ more common]. superficial venous insufficiency is the underlying cause of varicose and spider veins.

what's chronic venous insufficiency?
venous valvular insufficiency or venous reflux (venous blood flowing backwards because vein valve are broken) can cause varicose veins and swelling. when prolonged and severe though the high pressure and inflammation that is produced from the reflux can cause skin damage and even ulceration. when this occurs it is referred to as chronic venous insufficiency (or the older term venous stasis).
what's chronic venous insufficiency?
chronic venous insufficiency results from valve dysfunction in the venous system. this causes the pressure in the veins just under the skin to become too high resulting in swelling of the veins. these veins enlarge and become varicose leak water causing leg swelling leak blood resulting in skin discoloration. ulcers occur if the vein pressure becomes so high that it restricts arterial flow
