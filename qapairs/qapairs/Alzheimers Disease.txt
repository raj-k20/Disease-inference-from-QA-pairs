how can sleep apnea affect your life?
one of the questions asked of me is "what do you do for a living? " and i say save marrriages. because sleep apnea involves deep snoring sometimes as loud as a train horn and stopping breathing more the 10 seconds for many times an hour spouses run far away to get rest and peace of mind. sleep apnea also has links to many other issues such as diabetes stroke heart disease and alzheimers disease.
