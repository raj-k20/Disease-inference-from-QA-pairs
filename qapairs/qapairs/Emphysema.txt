i am 36/f i have type 2 diabetes on the pills i'm a smoker bout half pack a day i know i have this cough that i've been having for 4 or 5 mo is it se?
a chronic cough could be something benign like allergies serious like emphysema or deadly like cancer. you need to be seen and examined.
i have had every test done on my heart except a stress test and a heart cath i'm still having chest pain. i am a 27 yr old female i smoke overwight?
stopping smoking is 1 of the hardest things a person can do. keep trying & failing over and over again. u'll do it. smoking causes chest pain by itself even without heart damage. sooner or later it brings emphysema and cancer. there's not much doubt anymore. that doesn't make it any easier to stop. if you need help hock your hubcaps to buy patches for 2 mos minimum. gd luck!
i am 55 have severe dilated cardiomyopathy stage 2 emphysema and type 2 diabetes. trying to get a clearer of life expectancy.?
in you most related to your heart disease as a diabetes specialist the diabetes would not significantly reduce life expectancy more than you cardiomyopathy as long as sugars reasonably well controlled.
why do people with emphysema lose weight?
hypoxia and increased nutritional needs.
why do people with emphysema lose weight?
patients with emphysema work hard to breath. this effort uses up calories quickly. also the inflated lungs push on the stomach and limit the size of the stomach causing patients to ingest less food.
where can i find reliable information about pulmonary hypertension? i was recently diagnosed with pulmonary hypertension likely caused by emphysema and sleep apnea.
a good place to start is <link>

the pulmonary hypertension association is an outstanding resource for patients and their caregivers. the website link is: www. phassociation. org.
what's the difference between sleep apnea and nocturnal hypoxemia?
nocturnal hypoxia is a drop in oxygen in the blood when sleeping. it's associated with sleep apnea but also with hypoxic chronic bronchitis pulmonary hypertension and emphysema. sleep apnea can be due to airway obstruction or of central origin. it causes reduced oxygen often dangerously and arousal from sleep leading to daytime fatigue.
what exercises can my husband who is 76 do to loose weight with emphasemia?
given his age and what you have noted (emphysema a chronic lung problem) he should consult with his primary doctor (or his lung doctor) before starting a new exercise program. depending on the severity of the lung disease his ability to exercise may be limited. exercise helps weight loss by burning calories so it is a good idea.
why do people say if you are healthy you will look better but people who eat junk food still look beautiful?
just like not everyone who smokes develops lung cancer or emphysema. beauty has a strong genetic component beyond environmental exposures. but the healthy you are the better you may be able to work against suboptimal genetics and other difficult to control external factors.
is tympanic membrane perforation a contraindication for cpap & apap use for sleep apnea what is the treatment for ear discharge from this condition?
cpap overview cpap (continuous positive airway pressure) is a tool which can be used to assist the oxygenation of several respiratory pathologies. cpap is not a r eplacement for any medicati on or procedure but a t ool which can provide a high level of ventilatory support without the need for rsi or intubation. patients whose condition is resistant to parenteral medications but whose respiratory effort does not yet require intubation should be considered prime candidates for cpap. indications? respiratory distress secondary to suspected congesti ve heart failure acute cardiogenic pulmonary edema pneumonia and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (asthma bronchitis emphysema). contraindications? unconsciousness? suspected pneumothorax? inadequate respiratory drive? shock/hypotension (bp <90)? chest wall trauma? persistent nausea/vomiting? has active upper gi bleeding or history of recent gastric surge
can hiatal hernia affect my breathing?
large hiatal hernias can cause shortness of breath. the only solution for these large hernias is surgical repair. there are often other conditions however often present such a asthma or emphysema that can compound breathing problems. usually a large hiatal hernia can be diagnosed with an upper gi contrast study called an esophagram and upper gi series.
can being overweight cause distal bronchomalacia?
usually acquired causes of tracheobronchomalacia include compression of structures by goiter vessel cyst abscess. recurrent infection emphysema and certain types of trauma can also do it. with being overweight especially when lying down the resulting symptoms could be the same but i'm not exactly sure it causes the symptoms in the same exact way.
could someone take imovane with sleep apnea?
imovane is a central nervous system depressant prescribed as a sleep aid medication (. because imovane can worsen symptoms of respiratory disorders people with sleep apnea emphysema asthma or bronchitis may not be able to safely take imovane. never take any sleep aid without the supervision of a physician.
can someone tell me if smoking is bad for someone with insulin resistance?
insulin resistance is highly related to the development of diabetes and diabetes is itself a risk factor for development of coronary heart disease and myocardial infarction (heart attack) the number one cause of death in the us. smoking is the second most common risk factor for heart attack. combining them makes heart disease highly likely. plus various cancers bronchitis and emphysema.
help just had breast augmentation and i have crepitus! does this require medical attention?
i assume you are a medical professional because this is not a layman term. it may also be referred to as subcutaneous emphysema and is quite common for 7-10 days after surgery due to air trapped in the breast pocket during implantation. rarely lung injury may be the cause but this is usually associated with chest pain and difficulty breathing or catching your breath.
what could cause poor circulation and tachycardia?
poor arterial circulation from smoking and atherosclerosis. poor venous circulation from deep vein clots tachycardia is secondary to a huge list anemia emphysema cardiac etc.
i've been having heart palpitations for 2 weeks during night and sometimes in day. also short of breath when running. causes? stress? how to stop it?
get checked for thyroid/ heart condition viral illness autoimmune condition asthma bronchitis emphysema stress anxiety etc. treatment is geared toward the cause of the problem. take care!
i had a recent ekg done it said right bundle block what does that mean?
right bundle branch block is a common and usually a benign condition. it's due to a delay in the electrical conduction in the right part of the heart. it is sometimes related to lung conditions including emphysema. if you don't have other cardiovascular risk factors- hypertension diabetes high lipids smoking history obesity i won't worry about it. left bbb is more ominous. take care!
is it normal to have bradycardia while sleeping?
during sleep the body's physiology changes and it does so per stage of sleep so there can be times that the heart is slower however it can also slow down due to illness - for example in untreated sleep apnea the low oxygen levels can cause bradycardia or low oxygen levels from emphysema.
i have a pacemaker. but i am having trouble breathing when i lay down. what could it be?
it may mean that you have congestive heart failure i. e. extrafluid build u p in your body with leg swelling. when you sleep flat the fluid creeps up to the lungs making you short of breath. if you have edema you will need to control salt and water and take your water pills. other options are lung disease like asthma emphysema or pneumonia. it is imperative to check with doctor before emergency.
what can cause atrial fibrillation?
causes for atrial fibrillation. an easy one to evaluate for is an over active thyroid by checking a tsh. other causes are anything that causes structural damage to the heart. high blood pressure heart attacks abnormal heart valves heart defects you're born with (congenital) metabolic imbalance exposure to stimulants emphysema or other lung diseases previous heart surgery sleep apnea.
why am i freezing when air is set at 76-77 some shortness of breath. had ekg and chest xray. all good
go see your dr for a spirometry. you may have signs of asthma/ reactive airway or obstructive lung disease/ bronchitis or emphysema. if you smoke quit. best of luck!
how? does a medical examiner determine that the cause of death was a cardiac arrhythmia?
all deaths are ultimately from the electrical system of the heart stopping but if someone not on drugs simply falls over dead and the autopsy & labs show no clear fatal lesion i look for entities that cause rhythm problems such as coronary atherosclerosis emphysema or structural defects. when not present look for a channelopathy (old ekg's gene studies). that's a start -- wishing you comfort.
why when i get a pvc i feel a quick instant loss in breath and sometimes cough? this is so scary and starts my worry and anxiety
actually the underlying lung issue (copd asthma bronchitis or emphysema) can be one of the causes of premature ventricular contraction which is the result of the left ventricle of the heart contracting too early before receiving the expected signal from the sino-atrial node. hypoxia or a lack of oxygen in the blood can lead to this issue.
will boxing and smoking put you at risk for heart attack?
boxing no. smoking yes indeed. smoking is a major risk factor for coronary artery disease ( the cause of heart attacks) as well as cancer and emphysema.
my father in law had a heart attack and a pneumothorax. how can those be related?
if a person has emphysema and develops a spontaneus pneumothorax that progresses to a tension pneumothorax the cardiopulmonary stress can trigger a myocardial infarction if coronary artery disease is present. otherwise two separate independent events.
my hemoglobin came back elevated again (17. 5) im feeling extremely tired short of breath rapid heart beat and abdominal fullness. why?
dehydration can cause it. but some other infrequent causes are: advanced lung disease (for example emphysema) certain tumors a disorder of the bone marrow known as polycythemia rubra vera and abuse of the drug erythropoietin (epogen) by athletes for blood doping purposes.
high bp heart skips morning headaches lips and inside of thighs a blueish colour i think emphysema? had 1 episode of afib
you have multiple symptoms which cannot be answered online without a comprehensive physical exam blood testing pulmonary function testing ekg and cardiology consultation. it appears that you are also on a detox program and i suggest a review of all meds.
high bp heart skips morning headaches lips and inside of thighs a blueish colour i think emphysema? had 1 episode of afib
you should see a cardiologist to evaluate your heart function and structure. it's unusual to have these symptoms at such a young age. a lung doctor (pulmonologist) can help diagnose emphysema. call 911 if chest pain passing out weakness dizziness partial paralysis or short of breath. take care.
meaning of the diagnosis from an ekg 12 lead initial: sinus bradycardia low voltage qrs possible septal and inferior infarcts age undetermined.
sinus bradycardia means the heart rate is less than 60 low voltage qrs could be associated with many things including obesity emphysema lung disease pericardial effusion infiltrative cardiomyopathy etc possible septal and inferior infarcts age undetermined: there is some evidence of possible heart attacks on the septal and inferior walls of the heart and cannot determine the age of events
seeing pulmonarologist tomorrow for sob. chest x-ray ekg and blood work all normal. could it be asthma copd or emphysema? gp said lungs sound clear
many people with significant asthma copd/emphysema can have at rest clear lungs. there can be other causes of shortness of breath.
seeing pulmonarologist tomorrow for sob. chest x-ray ekg and blood work all normal. could it be asthma copd or emphysema? gp said lungs sound clear
a full pulmonary function study with diffusion studies a vo2 stress test and a high resolution ct of the lungs may be nedded to completely evaluate you shortness of breath. a simple cxr and physical exam is necessary but incomplete.
seeing pulmonarologist tomorrow for sob. chest x-ray ekg and blood work all normal. could it be asthma copd or emphysema? gp said lungs sound clear
it could be anything asthma copd emphysema or congestive heart failure etc. good that you are going to a pulmonologist for thorough check up.
my heart ef is <20% i have a defibrillator on heaps of meds im in stage 4 of emphysema and on limited funds i would like to ask more but i cant afford the fees thanks anyway?
happy to help but what is your question?
tightness in chest difficulty breathing but heart rate's normal what could it be?
could be cardiac origin- blockage in arteries or valve problem; could be lung origin- asthma emphysema pneumonia bronchitis; could be unrelated to heart or lungs- anxiety anemia etc. need a good evaluation to figure out what testing to best evaluate this.
my pulse ox is measuring my o2 at 100. it has never been that high. is that good or bad? i'm not in supplemental o2.
the maximum the pulse ox can read as a saturation of blood (and not the heart rate) is 100%. most blood is about 99% saturated but given standard errors in measurement 100% is not unexpected. if you can achieve this without supplemental oxygen and if you do not have lung disease (emphysema) then this is a good result keep up the good work!
pulse was 87 on finger pulse oximeter. sneezed and it jumped to 131 for over a minute. what causes this? freaking out!
when you get nervous[freak out] you hyperventilate [rapid breathing] which lowers your carbon dioxide leves which are blown off and thus your pulse oxygen levels jump up temporary taking a deep breath for sneezing g may do it 87 is low at rest should be 94 or above maybe you have emphysema from smoking? but not to worry over such thing.
what could be causes of stabbing chest pain with deep breaths? patient is 86 with mds emphysema & osteoporosis. started after vertebrate surgery.
stabbing or shooting chest pains with deep breaths are often caused by pinched intercostal nerves which run between 2 ribs. they can also occur with rib fractures or bruises pleurisy pulmonary blood clots or pneumonia. a spot xray or bone scan would spot a rib fracture which could occur in this patient with osteoporosis and copd.

what can cause extreme difficulty breathing?
heart (congestive heart failure blockage of arteries) kidneys (fluid overload) lungs (copd/ emphysema bronchitis) hypertension anemia anxiety and panic attacks alcohol to excess and drugs of any kind. smoking! and also complete lack of physical fitness (being out of shape) and several more!
what are some of the symptoms of lung cancer and emphysema?
common symptoms of emphysema include cough wheezing and shortness of breath. the problem with lung cancer is. many times there are no symptoms (like coughing up blood) until it is too late. that is why lung cancer is so deadly. and that is why smoking which causes lung cancer is so harmful.
what are the symptoms of end stage emphysema?
shortness of breath progressing to being short of breath even at rest
what are the symptoms of end stage emphysema?
end stage copd is usually characterized by shortness of breath which is so severe that one can barely rise from bed or from a chair without getting intolerable shortness of breath. incessant coughing also tends to accompany this.
what is end stage emphysema?
emphysema is a form of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (copd). there are different classifications of copd. end stage could refer to you needing to use daily medications in order to relieve symptoms of shortness of breath. this could also mean needing to use oxygen. if a physician has mentioned "end stage" it is worth visiting with a lung specialist called a pulmonologist.
what to do if my 85 year old mother has end stage copd and emphysema. she is breathing 28 times per minute?
breathing 28 times a minute suggests she's not getting enough oxygen or has other problems. you should check with her doctor to see if anything can be done.
what to do if my 85 year old mother has end stage copd and emphysema. she is breathing 28 times per minute?
there are inhalers that may help. these treat the wheezing and help ease her breathing some. other options are oxygen supplementation at rest and while walking. she may benefit from bipap. she would need to be tested for this to qualify. sometimes if copd very severe hospice may help or palliative care. need to have a talk with her md and determine her severity based on pft and quality of life.
which is the link btwn the alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency and the emphysema?
alpha-1-antitrypsin is a protease inhibitor. it is elevated in inflammation to keep the proteases in check which cause tissue damage. its deficiency allows the neutrophil elastin protease to destroy elastin which are the necessary components in the elasticity of the lung and cause the destruction of the interstitial tissues and cause emphysema.
what is the best medication for copd and why? i do not have emphysema.
what? emphysema is copd. there are several reasons to get copd not just by smoking. but unfortunately there is no 'best medication' for this. your pulmonologist i believe is most likely giving you the best options available.
what is the best medication for copd and why? i do not have emphysema.
there is no such thing as "best medication". there are certain common medications such as beta blocker and steroid inhalers but it depends on your pulmonary function status and symptoms. your doctor can go over what you need in your condition.
what is the recovery period of a right lung lobe resection due to emphysema?
the recovery time depends on the technical difficulty of the surgery any complications and your personal reserve and rate of healing. your doctor will able to provide more specific information.
why would someone with emphysema have swollen ankle?
if both ankles are swollen one should consider pulmonary hypertension. if only 1 ankle is swollen it is unrelated to emphysema.
why would someone with emphysema have swollen ankle?
can and does cause ankle swelling but in both ankles. if you only have one ankle that's swollen it usually means there is something local with that one ankle that's causing the swelling although emphysema certainly can make a little swelling worse. i would suggest a good vascular work-up to see the state of your circulation in both legs. if the ankle swelling is painful x-rays would be wise.
what is the early signs of emphasemia?
if you think you may have emphysema get checked out. there are no signs that are particularly early. copd can creep up on you so that by the time you're diagnosed the copd is at least moderate in severity. the ealiest sign would be a decrease in exercise tolerance but a number of other conditions cause that too. a hyperexpanded chest is a more advanced sign. most importantly if you smoke stop!
what medications do you commonly prescribe to your emphysema patients?
typically treatment for copd begins with bronchodilator and possibly steroid inhalers as well as oxygen therapy if the oxygen level is low. smoking cessation is also pursued if the patient still smokes in order to decrease airway inflammation and thus slow disease progression.
what medications do you commonly prescribe to your emphysema patients?
depending on severity bronchodilators/steroids plus oxygen.
what medications do you commonly prescribe to your emphysema patients?
i start with an as needed albuterol inhaler. if you are using this more than 2x/week then i start titotropium daily. if your pulmonary function tests demonstrate reversibility with bronchodilators i may add a long-acting beta agonist or inhaled steroid. i reserve oral steroids and theophylline as last resorts. smoking cessation meds are also commonly prescribed to active smokers.
what are the chances of getting emphysema if the person did not smoke for 30 years?
some patients are more susceptible to damage from tobacco and develop emphysema even after quitting smoking for many years and others never do. it is all very individual and cannot really be quantified.
what are the chances of getting emphysema if the person did not smoke for 30 years?
while tobacco is the leading cause of emphysema its not the only. if you quite smoking for 30 years and have healthy lungs they are likely to stay that way.
why do we consider emphysema as a chronic obstructive airway diseasesince there is no obstruction occurring?
most patients with significant emphysema do have airflow obstruction in fact severe airflow obstruction. with emphysema you get collapse of all the small airways in the lung and the airflow is trapped and therefore obstructed.
why do we consider emphysema as a chronic obstructive airway diseasesince there is no obstruction occurring?
there is obstruction in copd it is just not reversible unlike asthma.
what medical terms are related to emphysema?
copd and chronic bronchitis.
whats the lung condition cure rate for a 74 year old man who has emphysema?
there is no "cure" for emphysema. the damage that is done is permanent but with attention to smoking cessation and treatment ( inhaled medicine to breath easier vaccination against pneumonia and flu treatment of infections that involve the lung etc. ) most patients can live with the disease for many years and have symptoms controlled and quality of life improved.
whats the lung condition cure rate for a 74 year old man who has emphysema?
emphysema is not curable meds only improve the condition.
what percentage of senior citizens die of cardiovascular diseases?
cardiovascular diseases are the number one cause of death for both men and women claiming more lives than cancer emphysema etc.
what are the odds of surviving a second quadruple bypass surgery?
mortality for redo sternotomy redo coronary bypass is multifactorial. ejection fraction quality of the target vessels comorbidities like age obesity diabetes recent myocardial infarction degree of emphysema if former smoker glomerularfiltration rate stroke valve stenosis/insufficiency heart failure organ failure to incle some.
whats the difference between chronic bronchitis and emphysema outcome?
both chronic bronchitis and emphysema are chronic progressive diseases that respond favorably to smoking cessation. however how an individual sufferer will do is best predicted by knowing family and smoking history severity of the lung disease how the disease has affected th heart the patients overall conditioning etc.
whats the difference between chronic bronchitis and emphysema outcome?
both chronic bronchitis and emphysema are forms of copd chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. copd is not curable and it is slowly progressive. smoking cessation decreases airway inflammation and slows disease progression. there are treatments to control symptoms. if the oxygen level is low supplemental oxygen will decrease mortality.
whats the difference between chronic bronchitis and emphysema outcome?
the outcome for both types of copd is pretty much the same since both are slowly progressive and incurable diseases. the goal of treatment is to lessen symptoms as well as airway inflammation as much as possible.
when cachexia from emphysema causes emaciation what can be done?
the goal of controlling dyspnea in patients with severe copd can help. using multiple inhalers (both short and long acting) a pde inhibitor (new drug class) plus exercise seems to help the most. however weight loss due to copd is a sign of severe illness and end of life planning (if not already done) should be considered strongly.
when cachexia from emphysema causes emaciation what can be done?
unfortunately by this time returning to normal muscle mass and weight is unlikely. high protein supplements may be of some benefit. this reflects the systemic effect of emphysema on every area not just the lungs. anticipating weight loss and eating frequent small meals trying appetite stimulants like megace (megestrol) early and exercising may prevent cachexia in some cases. smoking cessation is essential.
when cachexia from emphysema causes emaciation what can be done?
there are many kinds of nutritional support that can be offered so the patient should be seen by their doctor so this can be initiated. but this typically occurs when the disease is quite advanced and the overall prognosis is often poor at this stage. nutritional support can still be attempted though so see your doctor.
when cachexia from emphysema causes emaciation what can be done?
the best thing is to ensure proper nutrition for these cases.
what can i do for my emphysema without going to a doctor?
the best thing you can do to prevent further lung damage and allow your lungs to heal over time is to quit smoking. your doctor can help you quit smoking and can offer other treatments as well. testing can be done to determine how bad your emphysema is as well. good luck!
what can i do for my emphysema without going to a doctor?
stop smoking if you do avoid smoke exposure or second hand smoking avoid extreme temperature and see a physician in case you need medicines.
what can i do for my emphysema without going to a doctor?
stop smoking if you have not done that daily moderate exercise and increase intake of fresh fruits and vegetables. see your doctor for up to date vaccination pneumonia and influenza. of course you need more than that but that is your choice to make.
what holiday location can you recommend to help sufferers of copd and emphysema?
any location that speaks to them. for those on oxygen caution with air travel and high altitudes. lodging should have easy access no long stairs to climb avoid long hikes consider availability of medical facilities including pharmacies bring enough medications. do not forget about seasonal allergies if they are a problem.
what holiday location can you recommend to help sufferers of copd and emphysema?
florida arizona and colorado. avoid colorado if emphysema is really bad because of altitude.
what does it feel like being in advanced stages of emphysema?
usually the advanced stages of emphysema are associated with shortness of breath even at rest. sometimes cough chest tightness wheezing. many times people require oxygen. it is quite uncomfortable. i hope you never reach that stage.
what does it feel like being in advanced stages of emphysema?
one of my patients once described emphysema as being similar to being underwater and not being able to come up for air - probably very accurate.
would you consider a dose of 2l of oxygen for treatment emphysema a high dose or low dose?
this is low dose oxygen and equal to roughly 27 percent inspired oxygen (we breath 21 percent).
would you consider a dose of 2l of oxygen for treatment emphysema a high dose or low dose?
oxygen is prescribed like any other medicine; the patient is given the amount necessary to maintain the patient's oxygen level within an acceptable range. too much oxygen or too little oxygen are both dangerous for the patient. therefore the amount prescribed must be carefully monitored by the physician so the amount needed is given.
why do people with lung disease often die of heart failure?
copd / emphysema patients develop right heart dysfunction late in the disease (called cor pulmonale)- this can result in fluid gain edema and heart failure.
what are the chances of getting emphysema if you have not smoked in 30 years?
but the answer is more related to how many packs a day and for how many years you smoked (packs x years) also related to individual genetic factors. if you have cough or shortness of breath see your doctor for a spirometry (breathing test). the test is quick and simple.
what are the chances of getting emphysema if you have not smoked in 30 years?
if you haven't smoked for a long time the risk of developing new emphysema is pretty low. but any damage that was sustained previously will always be there. whatever lung is lost is lost unfortunately.
what are the typical results for lung volume reduction surgery for patients with emphysema?
lvrs is successful in regards to improved survival in a certain type of patient. it helps patients live longer who have their emphysema confined to the upper parts of their lungs on chest ct and who have poor exercise capacity as determined by pulmonary physiology tests. to understand the role of lvrs in treating emphysema talk to a board certified thoracic surgeon.
what are the typical results for lung volume reduction surgery for patients with emphysema?
lung volume reduction surgery (lvrs) is a procedure which removes approximately 20-35% of the poorly functioning space occupying lung tissue from each lung. by reducing the lung size the remaining lung and surrounding muscles (intercostals and diaphragm) are able to work more efficiently. this makes breathing easier and helps patients achieve greater quality of life.
what are the long term affects of lack of oxygen to legs in emphysema?
lack of oxygen in emphysema is general and not localized to one part of the body. most critical and sensitive parts are brain and heart. if there is additional poor circulation to the legs lack of oxygen will contribute to leg cramps leg pain nerve damage poor wound healing and gangrene.
what are the long term affects of lack of oxygen to legs in emphysema?
but this assumes you have no arterial blockages in your legs.
what is the link between the alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency and the emphysema?
alpha-1 anti-trypsin is a protective chemical in the body that prevents destruction of lung and other tissues from the damage that the infection fighting cells can inflict. when you have a lack of this chemical the destruction of the infection fighting cells in the body can go unopposed. this is especially true when someone smokes which attracts those cells to fight off the toxins in the smoke.
what is the link between the alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency and the emphysema?
alpha one is a disease where a good enzyme is missing in the bloodstream. normally this enzyme prevents bad enzymes from destroying lung tissue. if the level of the good enzyme is low then lung tissue is destroyed resulting in emphysema. there are both mild and severe forms of alpha one.
what is the difference between copd and emphysema?
copd stands for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. many diseases are types of copd and emphysema is one type of copd. copd is a more general category!
what is the difference between copd and emphysema?
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease is the name given to a not reversable clinical condition when the patient experiences difficulty to breathe with wheezing ronchi chronic cough. emphysema is a pathological diagnosis when there is prove of rupture of septums between alveoli causing large pockets of alveoli together (bullas of air). most if not all patients c emphysema have copd.
what is the difference between copd and emphysema?
copd is more of a physiologic term while emphysema refers to end-stage changes of the lungs more anatomically. both terms are often used interchangeably.
what are the dangers of cigar smoking? i smoked a cigar or two a day for ten years and have recently quit. am i in danger of getting emphysema?
congratulations on stopping smoking! unfortunately smoking cigars has the same hazards as smoking cigarettes- see <link> quitsmokingsupport. com/cigars. htm. however unless you have an unusual genetic predisposition as dr. ruttledge discusses most people will not get significant emphysema from 10 years of smoking if you don't smoke again i like your odds!
what are the dangers of cigar smoking? i smoked a cigar or two a day for ten years and have recently quit. am i in danger of getting emphysema?
congratulations on quitting tobacco! this is by far the best medical decision you have made in your life --guaranteed! there are many factors that can influence your chance of getting emphysema including the type and quantity of tobacco that you smoke as well as the length of time that you smoked. however your genetic profile or the inherited set of genes from your mother and father is also very important and highly influences whether you are going to develop emphysema. some people who have a strong family history of emphysema or just even if you happen to be unlucky to inherit a set of emphysema-prone genes the amount of smoking that you did can easily be enough to cause emphysema. other factors such as environmental dust and fume exposure the development of other lung diseases and passive smoking can also lead to the development of emphysema. it is sensible to just to go and see your doctor who can order a simple pulmonary function test and see if you have emphysema.
what are the dangers of cigar smoking? i smoked a cigar or two a day for ten years and have recently quit. am i in danger of getting emphysema?
few cigar smokers inhale tobacco smoke in the way that cigarette smokers do so severe lung damage like emphysema is not common in cigar smokers. small cigars cigarillos etc are inhaled and can cause more problems. the biggest problems with cigar smoke relate to head and neck cancer - the mouth tongue lips throat and larynx where the cigar smoke does get to. get good oral exam and stay quit!
what is emphysema vs copd? is emphysema the same as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease?
copd chronic obstructive pulmonary disease is the broader category. emphysema is one type of copd ie emphysema falls under the category of copd.
what is emphysema vs copd? is emphysema the same as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease?
copd-chornic obstructive lung disease- is the general term fo the disease while emphysema is what is considered the final stage of copd.
what is emphysema vs copd? is emphysema the same as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease?
yes you can think of emphysema as essentially the same as copd. technically emphysema refers to the anatomical destruction of lung tissue i. e. a term used when referring to abnormal appearing lungs on either chest x-ray ct scan or lung biopsy. copd on the other hand is a general term describing patients who are either known to have emphysema or have a chronic cough (e. g. smoker's cough) typically in association with pulmonary function tests that show abnormal airflow into and out of the lungs. they are both treated and managed in the same way as each other.
why do people with emphysema sometimes have problems with fluid retention and ankle swelling?
this is usually related to right heart strain from lung disease or from pulmonary hypertension (high pressure in the pulmonary vascular bed). patients with advanced copd/emphysema develop increased pressure in their lungs which causes the right side of the heart to dilate/enlarge. this in turn causes fluid retention in the legs/ankles (known as edema).
why do people with emphysema sometimes have problems with fluid retention and ankle swelling?
the right side of the heart pumps blood into the lungs to be oxygenated and for carbon dioxide removal. if the pulmonary vascular pressures are high as sometimes happens with lung disease like copd the right heart may not be able to effectively pump the blood into the lungs. this blood then is the reason for fluid retention including ankle swelling.
why do people with emphysema sometimes have problems with fluid retention and ankle swelling?
sometimes people with emphysema had elevated pressure in the lungs due to the destruction of lung tissue. when this happens it is harder to pump blood through the lungs and it backs up in the legs and ankles. but there are also other reasons why this would occur including heart conditions and even side effects from medications. definitely get checked out.
what impact can nutrition and diet have on emphysema?
people with bad lung disease need to avoid becoming underweight. many lose weight due to the calorie burning nature of heavy breathing and once all the body fat is gone the patient may start losing the muscle mass they need to breathe. within reason people who weight more live longer with severe lung disease.
what impact can nutrition and diet have on emphysema?
a diet rich in fresh fruits and vegetables reduces the sensation of breathlessness. advancing emphysema causes significant weight loss. nutritional support is highly recommended.
what impact can nutrition and diet have on emphysema?
emphysema is a destructive and ultimately hypermetabolic process so adequate nutrition is required to prevent scavenging of the body in general. adequate amounts of protein are necessary to maintain the body's protein stores and muscular strength. at least one gram of protein per kilogram of body weight.
what impact can nutrition and diet have on emphysema?
you need to take in enough protein and fat so your respiratory muscles can have enough energy to work and regenerate; and limit the carbohydrates as copd lungs have trouble eliminating carbon dioxide which is their end-product. there are food supplements specialized for copd.
why do people have prolonged expiration in emphysema?
when the lung gets destroyed from smoking in emphysema they act like a plastic bag. thus it is easy to inflate but hard to deflate. thus it takes a lot longer to blow all the air out. that is why there is prolonged expiration in emphysema.
why do people have prolonged expiration in emphysema?
this allows more time for the patient to expell trapped air from the chest.
what is the percentage of smokers get lung cancer or emphysema?
about 15-17% of smokers develop lung cancer or emphysema. about 85% of patients with lung cancer have been exposed to significant amounts of cigarette smoke.
what is the percentage of smokers get lung cancer or emphysema?
sir richard peto the epidemiologist estimated that those who continue to smoke after age 35 have a 50% risk of dying of it. . heart disease joins lung failure and cancer in the chest but with each day more links to tobacco and many other cancers. my number is 14% of smokers get lung cancer. smoking is addictive. tobacco companies hate to admit this. quit never start get help.
why is it so dangerous to give large amounts of oxygen to a patient with emphysema?
in the late stages of emphysema or copd patients do not respond normally to stimuli that make normal patients breathe. they only keep breathing in response to low oxygen in their bloodstreams. if they are given too much oxygen their systems think that they don't need to breathe and they can actually breathe less or stop breathing. this is a rare problem. oxygen helps most emphysema patients.
why is it so dangerous to give large amounts of oxygen to a patient with emphysema?
oxygen is a drug and like any drug there are side effects if too much is taken. in a patient with copd too much oxygen can cause an increase in the carbon dioxide level which will result in the person being sedated and hypoventilating resulting in higher carbon dioxide levels. long term too much oxygen results in more lung damage over time. the lowest amount of oxygen needed should be used.
why is it so dangerous to give large amounts of oxygen to a patient with emphysema?
some patients can get a rise in their carbon dioxide levels with high doses of oxygen - this doesn't happen in every patient but if it does it can be dangerous.
what is the difference in symptoms between asthma and emphysema?
symptoms except that an asthma attack is reversible emphysema is not.
what is the difference in symptoms between asthma and emphysema?
different day. asthma occurs at any age emphysema is rare under age 40. symptoms - coughing wheezing shortness of breath are the same. bronchodilators & controller medications like inhaled corticosteroids are very effective in asthma; classically not effective in emphysema. not so fast many patients with emphysema have an asthmatic component & get significant relief with these drugs.
what is the difference in symptoms between asthma and emphysema?
ephysema is almost always caused by smoking except for a rare form of hereditary emphysema. if you never smoked then i can be almost 100% certain you don't have emphysema. a chest x-ray of an asthmatic can look "over inflated" (asthmatics have more trouble blowing air out than inhaling it) and sometimes is incorrectly interpreted as "emphysema" especially in a non-smoker.
what is the difference in symptoms between asthma and emphysema?
both are obstructive lung diseases. asthma can be seen in children and adults. it is spasm of airways and can be acute and chronic. emphysema is usually in older people and can be acute on chronic also. it's hallmark is destruction of the air sacs of lung as well as small airways. long-term uncontrolled asthma clinically looks similar.
what is best sitting position to help w/breathing if i have copd emphysema?
leaning slightly forward palms resting on the knees head slightly bent lips pursed fast breath in slow and prolonged exhaling. the goal is to get the respiratory muscles including neck muscles in the best position for maximal lift and empty out the lungs as much as possible to make room for more air coming in.
what is best sitting position to help w/breathing if i have copd emphysema?
sitting and stooping forward over a pillow --- is the comfortable position for a copd exacerbation.
what is the difference between chronic bronchitis and emphysema?
both are forms of copd so both are chronic incurable diseases typically caused by smoking. emphysema patients have shortness of breath as the primary symptom whereas chronic bronchitis patients have a chronic cough productive of sputum. both are slowly progressive but treatment will decrease symptoms.
what is the difference between chronic bronchitis and emphysema?
emphysema and chronic bronchitis are two conditions termed copd or chronic obstuctive pulmonary(lung)disease. emphysema is long term progressive disease which causes shortness of breath. the tissue necessary to suppot sructure of the lung is destroyed chronic bronchis is chronic inflammation of bronchi which causes cough and sputum production at least for three months in two successive years.
what is the difference between chronic bronchitis and emphysema?
in chronic bronchitis cough is very prevalent and typically productive of sputum. the classic definition is daily productive cough for 3 months out of a year. emphysema can be associated with cough but shortness of breath is more common. there are also a significant number of patients who overlap between both illnesses.
why do some people develop emphysema when they smoke while others do not?
similar to alcohol different strokes for different folks some get cirrhosis someno. same with smoking and emphysema. genetic likely. resolution don't smoke.
why do some people develop emphysema when they smoke while others do not?
patients who smoke and develop emphysema likely have a genetic predisposition for getting the disease - however we still have yet to identify these genes.
what is subcutaneous emphysema?
subcutaneous emphysema is a medical term used to indicate a condition where pockets of air have collected underneath the skin. this most often happens after chest surgery and frequently indicates that there has been an air leak from the lung or airways. it will dissipate or go away when the air leak has healed or is better controlled. this condition is temporary and not lifethreatening.
what is subcutaneous emphysema?
air under the skin that is typically leaking from your lungs but can also come from your esophagus or the trachea (wind pipe) or it could be due to infection. either way it can be a serious condition that requires treatment regardless of where the air is originating. you need to see your doctor right away who will examine you and perform tests to determine the cause and recommend treatment.
will getting lung reduction surgery fix my subcutaneous emphysema?
subcutaneous emphysema is usually the result of a collapsed lung (pneumothorax). it is treated with placing a drainage tube between the ribs to "suck" the air out from around the collapsed lung and allow it to reexpand. subcut. emphysema can take days to resolve even after the lung expands. lung volume reduction surgery is really an elective procedure rather than treatment for an acute process.
will getting lung reduction surgery fix my subcutaneous emphysema?
subcutaneous emphysema is the results of air tracking from the lungs through the chest wall and into the subcutaneous space. it is actually more of a cosmetic problem as it can look very disturbing. the main problem is the air leak from the lungs. you can drain the leaking air and keep the lungs inflated with chest tubes but if it persist you may have to consider surgery to seal the leak.
will getting lung reduction surgery fix my subcutaneous emphysema?
subcutaneous emphysema is a complication related to your lung emphysema or blebs beeing present in your lung. air leaking from your lungs tracks under the skin and causes subcutaneous emphysema. lung volume reduction should help as well improve your breathing overall. you need to discuss your surgical options with a thoracic surgeon experienced in lung volume reduction surgery.
why would removing part of my lungs help my emphysema?
lung volume reduction surgery or lvrs is for patients with chronic emphysema. emphysema is loss of the elasticity of the lung tissue with ballooning or air trapping. lvrs removes the bad lung tissue and allows the good lung tissue to take over. lvrs can be life saving in patients with poor function and emphysema in the upper part of the lung. lvrs is now performed minimally invasively.
why would removing part of my lungs help my emphysema?
removing parts of the lung for emphysema changes the way the lungs sit in the chest wall. the surgeons usually remove those parts of the lung that are not functioning anymore from the destruction of emphysema. for some patients this helps the lungs work better. but: this is a big surgery with potentially life threatening complications. you need to talk to a specialist in this procedure to discuss.
what are the reasons i might be ineligible for lung reduction surgery for emphysema?
there are strict criteria for someone to be eligible for lung volume reduction surgery. the best approach is to seek the opinion of a board certified thoracic surgeon.
what are the reasons i might be ineligible for lung reduction surgery for emphysema?
the disease should be focused in discreet areas. the patient has to have stopped smoking. exercise tolerance needs to be sufficiently depressed so that the surgery is needed in the first place. other medical conditions may make any surgical intervention a major risk. a full evaluation should be done before proceeding.
what are causes of a heart flutter?
hypertension heart attacks cardiomyopathy with chf mitral valve disease hypertrophic cardiac disease hyperthyroidism pulmonary embolus severe copd/emphysema with pulmonary hypertension cocaine and amphetamine addiction alcoholism anorexia congenital heart disease like wpw.
what is an example of an abnormal result of a lung perfusion scan?
a ventilation/perfusion scan (or vq) is a way to look at both airflow and blood flow to the lungs. abnormal blood flow can occur when there is a clot present (ie pulmonary embolism). abnormal ventilation can occur when airflow is affected by a blocked airway (ie from cancer) or because of destroyed air sacs/alveoli (like in emphysema). a radiologist typically will "read" a vq scan.
what would keep a pulse ox low on a hospital patient with emphysema who is on all the necessary meds.?
even when a patient is on "all the right medications"; the underlying lung disease can cause inflammation and lower the pulse oximetry readings (known as a copd exacerbation). most of the time the exacerbation will resolve over the course of 5-7 days but sometimes more powerful medications given intravenously (like steroids & antibiotics) are necessary.
what would keep a pulse ox low on a hospital patient with emphysema who is on all the necessary meds.?
sometimes despite all the right treatments the lungs of a patient with emphysema just can't deliver the necessary oxygen and needs help with extra oxygen. also if a patient with emphysema gets pneumonia or heart failure or fluid in the lungs this will also cause the oxygen to go low. further it is quite common for oxygen levels to go down when pts with emphysema sleep.
what is copd?
copd = chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. this has many causes but primarily is associated with long term smoking. two types are chronic bronchitis and emphysema. there are rarer causes of copd. it is treated by stopping the cause (smoking) and medications to open up the airways (inhalers and such). see your pcp pulmonologist or other provider of care for this illness if concerned.
what is copd?
1- in small number of patient who develop copd at earlier stage of their life there is a hereditary disease called "alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency". these patient could have never smoked. also by aging we develop emphysema which is called senile emphysema. senile emphysema best appreciated on xrays.
what is copd?
copd is chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. this term encompasses both emphysema and chronic bronchitis. this disease is usually due to smoking but can occur due to other things as well like black lung disease and alpha one antitrypsin deficiency.
what sort of disorder is emphysema?
emphysema is a form of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (copd). it is characterized by chronic obstruction in the airways usually due to smoking. symptoms include shortness of breath coughing wheezing etc. the diagnosis is made by an evaluation by a doctor as well as pulmonary function tests. there are treatments available. smoking cessation is important to prevent further lung damage.
what sort of disorder is emphysema?
emphysema is an enlargement of the airspaces in the lung. it leads to obstruction of airflow and inefficient gas exchange. it can be fatal and will soon be the third leading cause of death in th us. its principle cause is cigarette or tobacco exposure.
what sort of disorder is emphysema?
emphysema is a destruction of lung tissue with resultant reduction in oxygen and carbon dioxide exchange and respiratory effort. it's usually due to smoking but could be due to other medial conditions. it's treatable but not curable.
what sort of disorder is emphysema?
emphysema is destruction of lung tissue most often from smoking. i some people it is due to a genetic deficiency of a particular blocking enzyme. it causes difficulty breathing especially in its advanced stages. but many people with emphysema live full and active lives especially with proper treatment.
what kind of pills or treatment can somebody get for emphysema?
various tests can be done to see how severe the disease is and assess your oxygen level. medicines include various inhalers like bronchodilators inhaled steroids pills like corticosteroids and even oxygen therapy if your oxygen level is low enough. smoking cessation is important to prevent further damage and allow for lung healing over time.
what kind of pills or treatment can somebody get for emphysema?
options for treatment of emphysema are limited. the essential first step is stopping smoking. several aids are available to help with quitting. if oxygen level is low oxygen supplementation is benefitial. there are several inhalers both rescue and long term available for emphysema but they are of limited benefit. nutritional supplementation is essential.
what kind of pills or treatment can somebody get for emphysema?
there is a lot you can do 1) smoking cessation ( this will slow how much lung function is lost over time. 2) inhaled medicines can help shortness of breath and decrease the risk of symptom flare ups specifics 3) oxygen if advanced disease 4) vaccines for flu & pneumonia 5) pulmonary rehab 6) in select cases "lung volume reduction surgery". all of these merit a talk with your dr. to discuss.
what's the best treatment to get rid of difficulty breathing?
that depends entirely on the cause of the breathlessness. common causes include lack of fitness obesity asthma emphysema pneumonia congestive heart failure blood clots anemia thyroid disease acidosis from any cause hyperventilation broken rib tumors and on and on. this is the short list.
why would someone with severe copd/emphysema have 100% o2 sats and still severe sob at time even at rest. he's 71 has had increasingly difficulty breathing. been in hosp for 4 days and had every test. only thing came back positive was d-dimer. was sen
that is possible. off oxygen should decline saturation. ct may help define embolism! or destroyed lung areas.

copd or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease is subdivided into chronic bronchitis and emphysema. most patients with emphysema do have ch bronchitis to some extent as well. first he needs a full pulmonary function tests to asses severity of his disease and to determine prognosis/life expectancy. 100 saturation on room air or supplemental o2 is only one measure of lung function. dyspnea or shortness of breath is a symptom. it could be caused by underlying lung disease/ heart disease/vascular disorders like blood clots or anemia ( lack of enough hemoglobin) and last but not the least is deconditioning. you need to discuss with his pcp and if appropriate will need to see pulmonologist. there are certainly more treatment options at this time and age to help patients with emphysema. pulmonary rehab should also be considered if all treatment options have been optimized and cardiac causes have been ruled out as cause of dyspnea.
which treatment works the best and fastest for emphysema?
there are many treatments for emphysema a form of copd. bronchodilator inhalers can work quickly to relieve bronchospasm. oxygen therapy is used if your oxygen level in your blood is low. treatments are quite individualized so proper treatment requires a doctor's evaluation.
which treatment works the best and fastest for emphysema?
check with a pulmonologist too difficult to solve on the internet.
what is the best treatment for emphysema?
stopping smoking and (if needed) wearing oxygen are the two treatments with clear benefits. weight loss (if overweight) exercise and inhalers reduce the number of hospitalizations a patient has. rare causes of emphysema (alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency) can be treated directly but there is no treatment that reverses the lung injury caused by the disease.
what is the best treatment for emphysema?
typical treatments for copd include bronchodilator and steroid inhalers. oxygen therapy is prescribed if the blood oxygen level is low enough to warrant it. the best therapy is smoking cessation which will slow the disease progression and decrease symptoms. there is no cure and it is a slowly progressive disease.
what is the best treatment for emphysema?
emphysema is treated with the following measures: 1) quite smoking. this is a must will preserve lung function. 2) inhaled medicines. the exact ones vary but they help open airways and/ or decrease inflammation in the airways making it easier to breath. 3) flu and pneumonia vaccines. 4) pulmonary rehab ( an exercise and teaching program that helps breathe 5) severe disease has surgical options.
what are the most common symptoms of emphysema?
shortness of breath initially only with exertion but over time with progressively less exertion and even at rest is the cardinal symptom of emphysema.
what are the most common symptoms of emphysema?
there is spectrum of lung disease from "pure" emphysema to chronic bronchitis. the symptom common to all is shortness of breath. emphysema may have a dry cough unlike the juicy cough of bronchitis. some have chest tightness. coughing up blood is possible but rare.
what are different ways to treat abdominal aortic aneurysm?
depending on the anatomy shape size of the aortic aneurysm size and patency of the inferior mesenteric artery and segmental lumbar arteries size and quality of the iliac arteries runoff into legs and pelvis relationship to the takeoff of the renal arteries coronary artery disease status pulmonary function degree of emphysema body habitus morbidly obese? renal function. open vs stent.
why are emphysema patients more prone to infections such as bronchitis?
emphysema can impair the lung's normal defense mechanisms of clearing bacteria and allow an infection to get established. chronic bronchitis is actually more prone to develop infections than pure emphysema. both are under the broader category of copd. active cigarette smoking also increases the risk.
why are emphysema patients more prone to infections such as bronchitis?
emphysema patients has chronic obstructive lung disease so any infection can set in easily. it is manifested by shortness of breath and coughing episodes. meds are necessary.
why are emphysema patients more prone to infections such as bronchitis?
but we know how to fix it.
what is emphysema?
emphysema is a type of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. it is usually caused by cigarette smoking which damages the lungs leading to this disease. it is an incurable slowly progressive disease. once present treatments are aimed at reducing symptoms and insuring that there is enough oxygen in the body to support it. smoking cessation is vital to decrease airway inflammation.
what is emphysema?
this is destruction of lung tissue most often from smoking. it can cause symptoms of cough wheezing and shortness of breath. it is diagnosed by imaging and lung function tests.
what is emphysema?
it is a chronic-obstructive-pulmonary disease (copd) defined pathologically as: abnormal and permanent enlargement of air spaces in your lungs (not the airways) and destructions of structures called a aveolar walls without fibrosis (scarring). there is much information about this diease and so if you are curious go to national lung heart blood institute (nhlbi. nih. gov) to learn. good luck.
what is emphysema?
your lungs are supposed to be soft and spongy. emphysema your lungs are basically like swiss cheese stiff and not very functional (depending on how severe it is). it is commonly associated with smoking but there are some rare genetic disorders that can do it as well.
what is biggest risk of smoking if you manage to avoid cancer--emphysema or heart disease?
either or both heart disease and emphysema from smoking.
what is biggest risk of smoking if you manage to avoid cancer--emphysema or heart disease?
both though you may show sign or have symptoms of arterial blockage earlier than emphysema.
what problem could cause lower chest pain on the right side?
some of them could be a lung infection (pneumonia) bronchitis pulmonary embolus chest trauma muscle spasm shingles pleurodynia (viral infection of the pleura) rib fracture muscle tear gallstones hepatitis heart failure asthma attack emphysema thoracic spine disease with nerve root compression.
why are emphysema patients more prone to pulmonary infectionsand bronchitis?
this question is not fully answered. it seems in patients with emphysema the lungs ability to defend against infection is decreased but the specific areas of impairment are not fully known. they probably include changes in the cells which fight infection or identify infection changes in the lung produced by chronic inflammation impaired ability of the lung to clear mucous are a few.
why are emphysema patients more prone to pulmonary infectionsand bronchitis?
the dilated bronchi accumulate secretions that in a healthy person are moved up and out of the lungs. these secretions tend to get infected.
why are emphysema patients more prone to pulmonary infectionsand bronchitis?
emphysema patients have chronic airway obstruction which makes it difficult for them to exhale properly which can leave secretions behind in the lung which can then become infected. also there is chronic airway inflammation which also increases infection risk. lastly they tend to be more synptomatic with even minor infections making it appear that they have more infections than normal patients.
why are emphysema patients more prone to pulmonary infectionsand bronchitis?
emphysema doesn't usually occur as an isolated condition - it's part of a spectrum of chronic lung diseases all characterized by damaged breathing passages. thus resistance to infection is impaired and excess mucus is often produced resulting in cough phlegm and susceptibility to invasion by bacteria.
why is it that in emphysema stretched alveoli have reduced surface area?
in emphysema alveoli are not stretched. they are actually destroyed. most often this destruction is due to smoking but not always. so the decreased surface area is because there is a loss of lung tissue. and once that tissue is lost it is lost forever. so the bottom line is: the sooner one quits smoking the better.
why is it that in emphysema stretched alveoli have reduced surface area?
think of a bunch of hollow grapes versus a hollow grapefruit. if you cut them open and spread them out there is a much greater surface in the grapes than there is in the grapefruit. normal alveoli are like the grapes and emphysema like the grapefruit. there is less surface available in emphysema because the alveolar capillary membrane is truly smaller.
whats the difference between chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and emphysema?
emphysema is a disease of progressive destruction of lung tissue resulting in lungs that look like swiss cheese. copd can result from emphysema (due to loss of airway elasticity) but is primarily a disease of airway collapse when breathing out - leading to air trapping in the lung and difficulty breathing.
whats the difference between chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and emphysema?
copd refers to physiologic air flow obstruction. emphysema refers to destruction of lung parenchyma resulting in air flow obstruction.
whats the difference between chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and emphysema?
copd represents both emphysema and chronic bronchitis since it can be difficult to separate how much is present in any individual and the symptoms are similar. the big difference is chronic bronchitis produces a cough with sputum production and emphysema causes breathlessness without sputum. the damage in emphysema occurs in the air exchange units; the damage in bronchitis occurs in the airways.
whats the difference between chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and emphysema?
empysema is a form of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease copd. there are also other diseases that are a type of copd like chronic bronchitis.
what does all this mean? here are my abg results. what does it all mean? ph = 7. 426 pco2 = 30. 5 po2 = 112. 2 bp = 758 thb = 16. 0 o2hb = 93. 9 cohb = 4. 3 hco3act = 19. 6 thank you! methb = 0. 3 oxygen device = ra site = r radial source = arterial
the co2 is low which means your minute ventilation is high. either you are breathing faster or taking larger breaths than normal. there appears to be a metabolic compensation (low hco3) to maintain ph in the normal range. primary respiratory alkalosis is fairly uncommon. anxiety might cause hyperventilation but it's unusual for it to persist long enough that you would develop a metabolic compensation. also the oxygen saturation is on the lower end of normal but doesn't necessarily mean anything significant. the hemoglobin is a little on the high side at 16 which also isn't very significant on it's own. however those two things combined could indicate the presence of lung disease such as emphysema. not getting enough oxygen in the blood stream will result in a compensatory response by your body increasing the oxygen carrying component of your blood the hemoglobin.
what are the usual symptoms of emphysema?
usual symptoms of emphysema include shortness of breath decreased blood oxygen level decreased appetite decreased ability to sleep decreased activity level cough wheezing weight loss etc. the diagnosis is made by seeing chronic obstruction on pulmonary function tests which can occur without any symptoms.
what are the symptoms of lung cancer compared to emphysema?
emphysema typically causes breathlessness with exertion. cancer is silent at first but later can cause persistent cough or even coughing up blood. chest pain that is persistent may occur. emphysema generally doesn't cause much coughing unlike chronic bronchitis which often occurs in combination (copd).
what are the symptoms of lung cancer compared to emphysema?
symptoms of emphysema include shortness of breath cough which can have production of bloody sputum whether or not lung cancer is present. other symptoms include weight loss decreased appetite difficulty sleeping etc. these symptoms can also be present with lung cancer. lung cancer cannot be diagnosed by symptoms alone so see your doctor for evaluation to rule out lung cancer! and quit smoking.
what are the symptoms of lung cancer compared to emphysema?
secret of lung cancer is that it causes very few symptoms in the early stages. copd emphysema and chronic bronchitis have cough shortness of breath worse with exercise and stair climbing and can cause blue lips and finger nails purse lip breathing. lunf cancer can cause "clubbed finger nails" once underway lung cancer can cause trouble everywhere.
what are the final symptoms of copd-emphysema?
severe incapacitating shortness of breath and confusion from hypoxia(low oxygen) and carbon dioxide retention.
what are the final symptoms of copd-emphysema?
if you mean what are the symptoms that occur before death there are several. persistent shortness of breath even at rest wheezing and excessive sleepiness can all occur. typically an infection causes a sudden worsening of breathing that causes respiratory failure. deciding whether to receive ventilator support or just get comfort measures should be thought about in advance.
what are the symptoms of inherited emphysema?
are you referring to alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency? if so the symptoms are basically the same as copd they just occur at a younger age than expected (like 20-30s). symptoms include cough shortness of breath wheezing etc. if the person smokes the disease is accelerated. diagnosis is made via a blood test. treatment includes enzyme replacement as well as usual copd therapies.
what are the final stages (visual symptoms) of somebody dying from copd-emphysema?
in general people who are very end stage copd will have alot of difficulty breathing and typically will have fast and shallow breathing. eventually they cannot keep up and start retaining co2 which makes them mentally altered and hypoxic which also makes them sluggish/loopy (and usually causes a grayish cast to the features). these changes are shortly followed by cardiac arrythmias and death.
what are the final stages (visual symptoms) of somebody dying from copd-emphysema?
in the final stages of copd the patient cannot ventilate themselves at all and they cannot get enough oxygen into their body. they have severe shortness of breath and often get agitated because of this. they tend to have cyanosis or a blue color to fingers toes lips etc. there are medicines that can be used to make the patient as comfortable as possible but it is not a comfortable death.
what are options for emphysema treatment?
first smoking cessation is critical. there are a variety of medications that are very helpful at relieving shortness of breath and preventing flare-ups. pulmonary rehab programs are very beneficial. supplementary oxygen is needed if the blood saturation is less than 90% consistently. a healthy and well balanced diet with vitamin supplementation should be used.
what are options for emphysema treatment?
depending on how diffuse your disease is what the cause of your emphysema is how much you suffer from obstruction of the airway vs. destruction of the lung itself treatment varies. inhalers oxygen smoking cessation diet and exercise treatment of sleep disorders etc all should be discussed.
what is the best thing to do to help yourself if you have emphysema?
the two things that we know work well in emphysema are to quit smoking and to wear your oxygen is you need it. if you work in a job that exposes you to smoke rock dust wood dust etc consider another line of work or wear respiratory protection.
what is the best thing to do to help yourself if you have emphysema?
by far the most important thing is to quit smoking. beyond that there are several medications that can help with quality of life as well as going through pulmonary rehab. in any case all patients with emphysema should see a doctor who can see where they are and prescribe approp treatments (even aids to quit smoking! ).
what is the difference between emphysema and lung cancer?
emphysema is destruction of lung tissue from (most often) smoking. lung cancer is an abnormal growth of lung tissue that can cause destruction of many tissues not just lung. they are completely different diseases. but because the most common cause of lung cancer is smoking many times patients with lung cancer have emphysema and vice versa.
what is the difference between emphysema and lung cancer?
is destructive lung disease divided into chronic bronchitis and emphysems. it is measured by pft's: tests that determmine volumes and speed of moving air. lung cancer is increased in people with copd cells have gone awry travel to other parts of the body causing death by local progression or distant metastasis. similar cause: tobacco. mode of death quite different.
was emphysema really due to tobacco smoke?
in the us the vast majority of emphasema patients have a smoking history (even pt with alpha1-antitypsin def - genetic disorder that causes emphasa frequently only need treatment if they are also smokers). in the developing world many also develop emphasema from chronic exposure to biofuels ie. coal/wood fire cooking in the home or industrially.
was emphysema really due to tobacco smoke?
in simple terms emphysema means damage to air sacs in the lungs which leads to airflow obstruction. tobacco smoke is most common cause of emphysema. other causes include genetic (alpha 1 anti-trypsin deficiency) environmental (e. g. air pollution) or occupational (toxic fumes from gases).
what's the difference between lung cancer and emphysema?
in emphysema the air sacs of the lung (alveoli) are damaged. the result is the lung "traps air in the damaged sacs and it becomes hard to exhale. the lung becomes over inflated. breathing (getting oxygen in and carbon dioxide out) are progressively harder. in lung cancer a cell is damaged and can not regulate its growth ( ie becomes cancerous) with tumor formation. both are linked to smoking.
what's the difference between lung cancer and emphysema?
emphysema is damage to the alveoli the oxygen transferring areas on the lung. lung cancer is a mass of malignant cells but do not directly affect the alveoli. lung cancer can affect breathing by blocking the airway. hope this helps.
what could cause me to get emphysema if i have never smoked?
most notably alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency an inherited disease. also environmental or occupational exposures. second-hand smoke is also possible though by a longer stretch. sometimes normal chest x-rays of healthy young people are overread as emphysema. hope this helps.
what could cause me to get emphysema if i have never smoked?
exposure to other toxins including wood fires etc can also lead to copd and there are some genetic syndromes that also predispose patients to copd without or with a minimal smoking history - a pulmonologist can help evaluate these. furthermore chronic poorly controlled asthma or other bronchiolitis can also eventually cause irreversible obstructive lung disease.
what could cause me to get emphysema if i have never smoked?
there is a genetic form of emphysema called alpha-1-anti trypsin deficiency. it is caused by the absence of an enzyme alpha-1-anti trypsin. patients typically develop emphysema at an earlier age and a smoking history is not necessary but smoking accelerates the process. treatment includes enzyme replacement and it is diagnosed by a blood test.
what could cause me to get emphysema if i have never smoked?
there is a form of emphysema that is caused by deficiency of an enzyme called alpha-1-anti trypsin. if you are deficient in this enzyme you will develop emphysema at a younger age and it can occur without a smoking history. if you have this disorder smoking will further accelerate the process. treatment includes replacement of the deficient enzyme. it is diagnosed via a blood test.
what is lupus emphysema? and can lupus have systums that look like emphysema
lupus can affect the respiratory system in a variety of ways but i am not clear what is meant by this phrase "lupus emphysema" and suspect that there may be a misunderstanding here. lupus can be associated with inflammatory reactions of the lung tissue or lining of the lung lung scarring ("fibrosis") or diaphragm. a consultation with a pulmonologist (lung specialist) may be needed to clarify.
what is lupus emphysema? and can lupus have systums that look like emphysema
lupus and emphysema are two very different diseases. one can have both at the same time and also sometimes either one of them may cause fibrotic or scarring changes on the x-ray that may be confused.
what is end stage empysema?
severe emphysema that causes shortness of breath either at rest or with minimal exertion (such as walking across a room) would be considered "end stage" meaning terminal or life threatening.
what are the symptoms of emphysema?
typically emphysema causes shortness of breath without wheezing or congestion - just air hunger. there are many causes of this symptom however so testing is required for a proper diagnosis.
what are the symptoms of emphysema?
shortness of breath wheezing cough - usually dry but sometimes wet. you can also get chest pains etc.
what are the symptoms of emphysema?
shortness of breath especially on exertion; cough - usually dry; fatigue and general tiredness; loss of weight especially if advanced. go to a doctor they can diagnose quantify and treat it for you. and if you doubt what you hear come back to healthtap.
what are other alternative treatment for lung cancer with extreme shortness of breath if the oxygen treatment is not effective as it used to be?
more oxygen or morphine/derivatives to help with the shortness of breath. also depends on how exactly the cancer is causing the shortness of breath - is the patient getting treatment - chemo or radiation; is there fluid to be drained or an obstructed airway to be opened? is there infection (antibiotics) or concomitant emphysema (nebulizers steroids) - talk to your doctors.
what is the cause of emphysema in men?
smoking smoking and smoking. then there are genetic causes like alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency and rarely occupational exposures. in some parts of the world open pit charcoal burning can cause emphysema.
what is emphysema prognosis 80 years old?
it depends on the severity of the copd. if the copd is well-controlled and is not severe enough to affect physical functioning the patient may actually die of some other cause. if however the copd is end-stage then the prognosis is much worse. your doctor can tell you the severity of the copd so you have a better idea of prognosis in the individual case. good luck!
what percentage of smokers get emphysema?
a much much higher percentage than non-smokers who get emphysema.
what percentage of smokers get emphysema?
for those who smoke the equivalent of one pack of cigarettes for 15 years (pack years) the risk is about 25%. this is lower than many people think but the other related health risks of cancer and vascular disease still make smoking a losing proposition.
what is the physiologic difference between asthma copd emphysema and bronchitis? how to identify each as an emt? how are they treated?
as an emt in these cases you primary concern is to make sure the patient can breathe. in asthma codp emphysema and "chronic bronchitis" a resuce inhaler like albuterol or ipratropium(copd) owuld be your first response. steroid inhalers are not for rescue situations.
what is the physiologic difference between asthma copd emphysema and bronchitis? how to identify each as an emt? how are they treated?
asthma is a reversible airway disease due to allergens either extrinsic or intrinsic. copd is classified into chronic bronchitis and emphysema depending on the pathology. these are termed irreversible airway diseases. bronchitis is damage to the lining of bronchioles resulting in excessive secretions whereas emphysema is loss of elasticity of alveoli resulting in bad air exchange. careful history.
what is the physiologic difference between asthma copd emphysema and bronchitis? how to identify each as an emt? how are they treated?
asthma is seen more in younger people may have an allergic component and they tend to wheeze and be hypoxic. copd and emphysema are interchangeable. more in older smokers may be hypercapneic and you should be careful about giving them too much oxygen. in an emergency follow your abcs (abacavir). there is much more let me know if you need more info.
what do the lungs look like when a patient has emphysema?
autopsy specimen of patients with advanced emphysema shows blackened lungs with punch out holes like swiss cheese because of destruction of lung parenchyma and large holes formation because of collapse of lung alveoli and formation of blebs and bullous cavity. however this is the end stage disease.
what is your life span with emphysema if you contiune smoking?
multiple factors contribute to a persons death from emphysema. if the person still has good exercise capacity and no heart disease they tend to live longer as opposed to patient with frequent exacerbations of their emphysema and if they have heart disease. smoking cessation will add years to the life of a person with smoking related lung disease.
what is your life span with emphysema if you contiune smoking?
usually shorter than if you quit smoking.
what is the etiologic agent mode of transmission source of infection and period of communicable of emphysema?
emphysema is not an infectious disease. it is caused by smoking long-term uncontrolled asthma occupational and other exposures or may be inherited.
what is the etiologic agent mode of transmission source of infection and period of communicable of emphysema?
emphysema is not a communicable disease but rather a consequence of cigarette smoking.
what is the life expectancy of someone with chronic emphysema?
calculating life expectancy in copd is very challenging. limited life span is found in patients with chronically elevated carbon dioxide levels frequent exacerbations of the disease and low body mass index. given you an exact survival percentage is usually not possible.
what is the life expectancy of someone with chronic emphysema?
this is very difficult to answer. the severity is important as are other health problems. as the disease becomes more severe the risk of death becomes higher. actually most patients with copd die from cardiovascular disease or infections.
what are long term affects of lack of oxygen to legs from emphysema?
damage to arteries leading to peripheral arterial disease.
what are histoplasmosis and emphysema?
histoplasmosis is a fungal infection that tends to affect immunocompromise patients more than normal hosts. it can cause a variety of symptoms including pneumonia but also fibrosis mediastinitis. emphysema is a lung disease associated with smoking and is not caused by any infection though patients are at increase risk of infections once they have emphysema.
what are histoplasmosis and emphysema?
a fungal infection that can affect the lungs and can be found in the usa in the upper mississippi and ohio river valleys. emphysema is a chronic lung disease often caused by smoking which is also called copd. people with emphysema are more likely to be chronically infected with histo.
what is done for emphysema?
the most important thing is to stop the cause which in the vast majority of cases is smoking-related. thereafter treatment focuses on keeping the airways open with medications. there is less room in the lungs (even though they're bigger) for gas exchange so many of these patients require supplemental oxygen.
will copd necessarily progress to emphysema?
copd (chronic obstructive lung disease) is a group of diseases that includes emphysema and chronic bronchitis. the disease names do not indicate severity.
will copd necessarily progress to emphysema?
copd is a combination term we use to describe emphysema and chronic bronchitis. some patients have strictly emphysema and some have strictly chronic bronchitis. however most patients have a combo of the two.
will copd necessarily progress to emphysema?
copd is a big box. it includes many diseases such as asthma bronchitis asthmatic bronchitis and emphysema. check with your lung doc.
what is the life expectancy for someone with emphysema?
it depends on the severity and other medical conditions which coexist. many emphysema patients die of other causes. frequent flare ups leading to repeat hospitalizations or repeated respiratory infections are poor prognostic indicators.
what is the life expectancy for someone with emphysema?
can affect life expectancy with emphysema. how severe is it how limited is your exercise tolerance have you ever been hospitalized to treat an exacerbation? how limited are your activities and what other ailments do you have? (coronary disease heart failure cancer etc. ) there is no text book with the answer to this question and even knowing all this won't lead to a very accurate answer.
what are other effects of emphysema?
shortness of breath is number 1 but weight loss susceptibility to infection and cardiac disease are also possible.
what is emphysema?
of the small air pouches in your lung called alveoli. when the walls become damaged the alveoli merge into one larger pouch decreasing the surface area where gas exchange can occur. think of this by comparing the surface area of a ballon of equal size to a bunch of grapes. though individually smaller there are many grapes in the same volume so more surface area.
what is emphysema?
emphysema and chronic bronchitis are but parts of copd (obstructive pulmonary disease). in emphysema the continual inflammation causes damage to the lungs that cannot be repaired or will go away. if you smoke- quit if you don't- don;t start.
what is emphacema?
emphysema is a chronic obstructive lung disease part of the copd. it is caused by smoking cigarettes with destruction of lung tissue and terminal bronchial tubes. need to see a physician if you are worried about having emphysema. you will need pulmonary function tests and chest radiograph for further work up.
what type of inhalers are best for emphysema?
you should discuss this with your pulmonologist who can direct you to which inhaler is going to be best for you. there are many to pick from.
what type of inhalers are best for emphysema?
there are short acting bronchodilators like albuterol and ipatroprium. there are long acting bronchodilators like salmeterol formoterol indacaterol tiotroprium and aclidinium (which is just about to be released). there are also combination inhalers which have high potency inhaled steroids mixed with bronchodilators. ask your doctor which is best for your situation.
what type of inhalers are best for emphysema?
different types of inhalers exist for the different stages of emphysema. it is necessary that you ask your lung doctor about what stage of emphysema you are to get the appropriate treatment.
what is the best type of home air purifier/filter for emphysema? there is an oreck that uses all three components: ionic hepa charcoal?
several of my patients have used the oreck and its done well by them. check with your pulmonalogist.
what is the best type of home air purifier/filter for emphysema? there is an oreck that uses all three components: ionic hepa charcoal?
hepa filters are generally the most effective for removing particulate matter from the air. however there are no good studies that show improvement in outcomes for copd with air filters. perhaps saving your money for approved medications and pulmonary rehab would be better?
what are the chances of having copd/emphysema with normal spirometry and ok non hrct ct sscan did show lung cysts. i am concerned because of sob.?
a pulmonologist should be able to help you determine if you have emphysema or if the cysts in your lungs are related to another disease like histiocytosis x. for sure if you are a smoker today should be your last cigaret.
what are the chances of having copd/emphysema with normal spirometry and ok non hrct ct sscan did show lung cysts. i am concerned because of sob.?
by defintion spirometry readings should not be "normal" for copd/emphysema. if you mean they have not changed for a period that is somethign different. your sob may be the result of deminished lung function or something exacerbating youtr copd. not sure that "cysts" are cause- need more info. can your sob may also be caused by overlapping asthma? are you using a resuce inhaler?
what is the life expectancy of someone with 25% use of heart & 25% use of lungs with severe emphysema?
there are so many factors that contribute to life expectancy that it is not possible to predict life expectancy with this information. the best way to prolong your life as much as possible is to optimize your therapy including smoking cessation so see your doctors and follow treatment advice.

it depends on many many other factors.
what do emphysema and sarcoidosis lungs look like?
depends on the stage of sarcoid and emphysema. may look normal early on but can vary.
what happens to me now that i have emphysema and pulmonary sarcoidosis?
it all depends on the severity of each problem. both copd and sarcoidosis can be treated but neither is curable. if you smoke you must stop right now. rely on a pulmonary specialist to manage this complex set of problems.
what happens to me now that i have emphysema and pulmonary sarcoidosis?
to stop smoking. smoking cessation will decrease the decline in your lung function. as for sarcoidosis many of my 50+ patients with this disorder have less problems as they age. sarcoidosis seem to be less active in older patients.
which of these are restrictive: obstructive pulmonary diseases are asthma chronic bronchitis and emphysema?
airway "obstruction" refers to limitation of air flow through the airways. "restriction" refers to processes that keep the lungs from opening fully when you inhale. restriction can result from fibrosis or thickening of the lung as with diseases like idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. it can even be from something as simple as obesity or muscle weakness that keeps you from breathing deeply.
which of these are restrictive: obstructive pulmonary diseases are asthma chronic bronchitis and emphysema?
restriction is defined as low lung volumes. less air "capacity" of the lung. less air moves into the lung. a "thick" chest wall ( obesity) poorly functioning respiratory muscles are some reasons. pulmonary fibrosis is another distinct category. "fibrosis" disorders are varied and are described as interstitial lung disease
which of these are restrictive: obstructive pulmonary diseases are asthma chronic bronchitis and emphysema?
all the pulmonary fibrosis diseases are restrictive as are the infiltrative diseases.

almost all emphysema is smoking related. >80% of lung cancers dvt and pulmonary embolism are related but have other issues frequently surgery trauma obesity coagulopathies sedentary etc.
what can be initial signs of emphysema?
the elasticity of the lung is impaired in emphysema reducing the patient's ability to exhale resulting in wheezing and shortness of breath. early symptoms may also include daily cough particularly in the morning. recurrent episodes of bronchitis can occur as the disease progresses. severe emphysema can also cause low oxygen levels heart failure and death.
what can be initial signs of emphysema?
weight loss and shortness of breath.
what can be initial signs of emphysema?
emphysema is a destruction of lung tissue with resultant reduction in oxygen and carbon dioxide exchange and respiratory effort. this leads to shortness of breath and chronic productive cough. it's usually due to smoking but could be due to other medial conditions. it's treatable but not curable.
would a lung x-ray show if someone had emphysema?
there are certain characteristic (e. g. hyperinflated lungs) which a doctor may see on chest x-ray of a patient with emphysema but not always. clinical history and pft/spirometry are usually needed to make the diagnosis.
what does trouble breathing mean if no doctor can figure it out the source of breathing problems and the breathing test caomes out fine and they still?
reassurance that everything is normal. i presume you were checked for reactive (asthma)/ obstructive (bronchitis emphysema) airway disease acid reflux post nasal drip coronary artery disease etc. take care!
what could cause emphysema -like changes on chest xray that isn't emphysema? 58 yr old never smoked
is difficult to diagnose on chest xray unless it is advanced. sometimes emphysema can be suggested with lung hyperinflation. this finding however is nonspecific and can occur with just taking a really deep breath. consider seeing a pulmonologist if you are concerned.
what are the possible causes of shortness of breath?
you're taking albuterol so asthma & copd/emphysema come to mind. pleural effusion & pulmonary embolism too. bronchitis & pneumonia. heart attack & heart failure. abnormal heart rhythm. pneumothorax. if that's not enough check out <link> check w/your doc for thorough evaluation.

emphysema in smokers commonly and cause cough short of breath right heart failure and not much pain. mesothelioma and association with asbestosis and also commonly smokers. may be asymptomatic until chest wall pain or fluid compressing lung. over time they are both life threatening.
what are the different symptoms from mesothelioma and emphysema?
dyspnea the feeling of breathlessness. emphysema results from destroyed lung decreasing surface area to exchange o2 & co2. meso produces fluid or traps lung impairing lung expansion by fluid or constritive bands trapping lung.
what are the symptoms of severe emphasema?
emphysema is the destruction of the tiny air sacks in the lungs. it causes shortness of breath fatigue and difficulty exhaling. mild emphysema might go unnoticed. moderate emphysema might cause shortness of breath with walking up steps and severe emphysema could cause shortness of breath just walking 20 steps. patients with severe emphysema often need oxygen inhaled medicines and prednisone.

shortness of breath and/or air hunger particularly with exertion is the most common symptom of emphysema.
what does "bilateral orbital emphysema" mean? (injuries were after a fall)
it means that there is air around both eyes. this is typically a benign condition with many cases having a history of trauma and fracture of an orbital bone which allows air entry. this should be evaluated and followed by your doctor.
what does "bilateral orbital emphysema" mean? (injuries were after a fall)
could you mean edema?
what does bullous emphysema changes mean?
this diagnosis is specific findings seen in imaging only and can not be made on clinical basis alone. it means there are destroyed areas in the lung that cause coalescence of the walls of the alveoli and instead of small spaces we see the big spaces or bags of air with less total surface area and by their sizes can push on other areas of the lungs.
what does bullous emphysema changes mean?
on chest x-ray or ct there is less lung tissue seen (emphysema) with larger pockets of air in certain areas (bullous).
what's the differance in bronchiectasis vs asthma copd emphasima. what there similarities between the other disease's. i can't stop coughing at night?
bronchiectasis is due to chronic infection damaging the ends of bronchioles and creating a haven for chronic infection. asthma is due to reactive airway disease making it difficult to get air out. copd is a complex process and can involve emphysema and brochiectasis. see your doctor to figure out why you are coughing. without more info cannot diagnose this.
what's the differance in bronchiectasis vs asthma copd emphasima. what there similarities between the other disease's. i can't stop coughing at night?
copd is chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and is a clinical diagnosis. emphysema is the destruction of alveoli the small lung sacs. asthma is narrowing of the bronchioles often with mucus production. therefore asthma and emphysema can be included in the diagnosis of copd. bronchiectasis is abnormal dialation of the bronchioloes usually due to chronic or repeated infections.

what do i do about severe emphysema and large bullae?
see your pcp for referral- no smoking or be near anyone who does.
what do i do about severe emphysema and large bullae?
if you have severe emphysema with large bullae at your age you should be tested for alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency a form of emphysema that occurs at a younger age. part of the treatment if you have this is to replace the enzyme so the disease progression is much slower. if not emphysema is treated with smoking cessation bronchodilator and steroid inhalers and oxygen therapy if needed.
would there be complications of pregnancy with a 31 year old with mod-severe emphysema?
pregnancy does increase pulmonary strain by increasing metabolic demand and decreasing overall lung capacity. the key is to work closely with your ob and pulmonary specialists to minimize risk.
why do i have a hard time breathing hot air under a blanket in a car with the heater on or when chest is submerged in hot water (jacuzzi or bath)?
generally this may have to do with the water tension in the air. so hot dry air or hot moist air can be more difficult to breath in for some people. typically patients with breathing problems (asthma emphysema) do better with warm moist air (but not hot). try saline nasal spray before entering the hot or dry environments.
what to do if i have emphysema. if you have it too will you tell me what meds your md has you on and how they are working?
copd treatment includes smoking cessation since if you continue to smoke the disease will progress faster. bronchodilator and steroid inhalers are typically prescribed to alleviate symptoms. if your oxygen level is low enough supplemental oxygen is prescribed and this will also decrease disease progression. see a lung doctor for diagnosis and treatment.

the treatment is pretty standard. if she's satisfied with her doc trusts her/him then there's no need to go further.
what do you suggest if my mom has just been dagnised with emphysema?
disease characterized by airflow obstruction. symptoms are usually related to shortness of breath and or cough. primary factor is smoking. smoking cessation is needed. depending on severity and symptoms treatment may imply using an inhaler or nebulizer. in more severe cases use of controller medications such as advair spiriva breo anoro symbicort (budesonide and formoterol) or nebulizer medications. oxygen may be neede
what happens if you have emphysema can you still use nicotine inhalers or does this still damage your lungs?
although you may have more trouble with cough after using the inhaler. it is not nicotine that causes damage to the lungs it is the other substances in tobacco smoke - "tars" are organic compunds produced by tobacco combustion plus things like carbon monoxide formaldehyde and many other additives flavorings preservatives etc. i would recommend the nicotine lozenges instead to avoid cough.
what do you suggest if my husband has c. o. p. d emphysema advanced?
pulmonary rehabilitation. avoidance of smoke second hand smoke and perfumes. bronchodilators. steroids when needed. antibiotics when needed. oxygen therapy when needed. recognition and acceptance of his limitations. advanced directives.

graded exercise for respiratory patients is your best bet. you should look for a structured program supervised by an exercise physiologist. we call this "pulmonary rehabilitation". if your oxygen saturation drops to
what happens next after a lung function test is fine but have shortness of breath?
shortness of breath or dyspnea can be caused by several things including: physical exertion stress or anxiety asthma lung diseases including emphysema heart disease
why does emphysema keep progressing even if you stop exposing your lungs to irritants such as tobacco smoke?
are talking about yourself at least i hope not at 22 y. o. lung function diminishes with age and even more so in smokers. if a smoker with emphysema stops smoking the lung function will stabilize but depending on their age it will deteriorate as they get older particularly if there is a lot of air pollution environmental exposure to other toxins or a hereditary predisposition to emphysema
what to do if i have serious emphysema and large bullae?
see a pulmonary physician
what does it mean if my husband has c. o. p. d emphysema advanced?
it means he has serious lung disease. keep him close to your doctor and follow all the advice you get faithfully. there's no cure but it's a treatable condition. of course keep him away from all forms of smoke.
what kind of antibiotics are given for emphysema?
emphysema is not an infection per se however patients that have emphysema or copd are more susceptible to infections such as pneumonia or chronic bronchitis. the antibiotic choice can vary dependent on other medications a patient is taking age and other medical problems. typically broad spectrum antibiotics are used to cover chronic and deep infections.
what kind of antibiotics are given for emphysema?
there is not an "antibiotic treatment" for emphysema. antibiotics are often given for the bronchitis associated with emphysema. these are the "broad spectrum" types eg: doxycycline hope this helps dr z
what to do if i have pulmonary fibrosis and severe emphysema copd?
you have 2 conditions which can both cause similar symptoms of shortness of breath & exercise limitation. it is important to see your doctor to find out why you have these diseases at a young age and to treat the underlying causes of both. also it's important to figure out specifically which type of pulmonary fibrosis you have because treatments can differ and lung transplant may be an option.
what can a ct lung scan show without contrast? pulomonary embolism not likely but persistent shortness of breath at rest
interstitial lung disease and bronchiectasis sometimes areas of emphysema can be shown. contrast is usually needed to differentiate lymph nodes from other structures metastatic disease abscess and tumor necrosis as well as pulmonary embolism.
which body system does emphysema affect?
emphysema is a disease of the respiratory system
should a patient with emphysema clean their own apartment?
if you are sensitive to dust and dust makes your lungs react then you shouldn't clean your apartment. but if you don't have a problem with dust then staying active with emphysema is always good. that said you can have someone clean your apartment for you and blame the emphysema. <positive_smiley> but i will leave that up to you.
should a patient with emphysema clean their own apartment?
depends on their activity level. if they are able to do it that would be good. if not then they need help. dusting might trigger cough. avoid chlorinated bleach.
what does copd/emphysema with lateral perihilar atelectasis or scarring mean?
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease encompasses emphysema and chronic bronchitis. basically this means that smoking or another inhalant has made distortions in the architecture of your lungs that make it harder for them to work. atelectasis and scarring physical changes that occur secondary to copd.

what is the medical definition of emphysema and copd?
copd refers to the decreased airflow seen in the disease. emphysema is the pathologic process in the lung seen with copd. however the terms are used interchangably when discussing tobacco related lung disease. patients fear the term emphysema and prefer copd or chronic bronchitis
when drs listen to u breath can they tell if you have copd or emphysema?
when a patient has obstructive airways disease the expiratory phase of respiration is increased compared to inspiration. there often are additional sounds which can indicate airway obstruction. when added to other physical findings these can suggest copd or emphysema.
