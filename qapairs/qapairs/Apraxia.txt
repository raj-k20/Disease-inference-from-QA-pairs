hi i'm 5 days post op having tumors removed from my r foot and ankle. i've. been having an issue with numbness tingling severely cold feet and cramps?
this question should be directed to your operating surgeon if symptoms emerged immediately postop. it would be helpful to know the pathology of the tumors removed. were they invasive or did they compress or damage nearby peripheral nerves? peripheral nerves are fragile and easily damaged by traction compression and transection. these symptoms sound like neurapraxia - damaged peripheral nerves.
