i am taking phentermine and 5 htp is there any contra indication in the two?
there isn't any good evidence that 5-hydroxytryptophan (5-htp) is effective for weight loss and only minimal evidence that it works for depression. there was a rare serious side effect (eosinophilia-myalgia syndrome ems) but this was traced to contaminants in earlier preparations and should not be a problem now. too much 5htp can cause serotonin syndrome - so it may be best to avoid it.
what's 5-htp and is it an implication for weight control social anxiety and depression?
5-htp is a precursor to tryptophan the amino acid used to create serotonin. the national institute of health recommends not to use 5-htp until more is known. 5-htp might be unsafe. some people who have taken it have come down with eosinophilia-myalgia syndrome (ems) a serious condition involving extreme muscle tenderness (myalgia) and blood abnormalities (eosinophilia).
what do these findings mean: eosinophilia monocytopenia high tsh (36 19) hypertrygliceridemia high crp plus back and flank pain night sweats?
these findings indicate that your doctor has not spent enough time discussing your physical examination and all of the lab results. if that is the case have your doctor send you all of the information he/she has about you and ask your family and friends to recommend a better doctor.
