what happen if my aplastic anemia getting worst? because i keep fainting several times and sometimes i can't even stand for too long.
you will need to discuss management of your disease with your physcian. especially if you have been told you have "aplastic anemia" at age 23 and are not fully educated about your disease and under the care of a specialist hematologist you need to do some investigating on your own. best wishes.
