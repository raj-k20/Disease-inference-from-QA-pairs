make sure to keep strict glycemic control. if you already had the surgery the assumption is you were medical stable and labs were in order. although i guess better late than never this would of been a great question for your surgeon before your surgery.

not necessarily. it depends on many factors: circulation ( good arterial flow and no chronic swelling) whether or not you have neuropathy and how well your sugar is controlled. some say that it may take twice as long to "heal". keep foot elevated as much as possible follow your doc's orders and watch for signs of infection (redness pain heat bdrainge).
why does one have a swollen foot after union surgery and what can be done about it?
there are many many different types of bunion surgery and the more involved ones take longer for the swelling to go down. but even with the lesser ones it's not uncommon to be swollen for up to a year but it should get progressively better over time. as the other doctor suggested speak to your surgeon about this. good luck!

with any foot surgery there is always a risk of swelling when the foot is down due to gravity. keep in mind bunion surgery is a reconstructive procedure and it takes time for the bones and soft tissue to remodel. if a foot is not allowed to properly heal prior to returning to activity it will delay the healing process and can result in swelling. talk to your surgeon if you are concerned.
