the virus that causes cold sores is making a bunch of copies of itself in the cold sore. if you touch it you are picking up all the microscopic viral particles and basically like sowing seed transferring it to a new spot to grow more. you may not even realize that you have an open wound the virus is so small it can get into tiny cracks.

how do i treat a partly healed second degree burn? my husband burned the back of his hands with a sedilien torch a couple weeks ago. we've been treating it with neosporin ointment. it still stings and itches him. what else can i do?
since the burns involve his hands you should probably have a doctor look at him. the itching can be part of normal healing but the stinging is concerning. in the meantime i've listed some basic burn information below. there are three burn classifications which will help you know what to do. 1) first degree burn: usually just redness swelling and pain. unless it involves large areas of the hands face groin feet buttocks or major joint you can treat the area as a minor burn. if the burn does involve the areas listed you should call your doctor or go to the emergency room. first degree burns may have discoloration of the skin for a few months but do not usually lead to permanent scars. 2) second degree burn: pain redness swelling and blistering. as long as the burn is less than 3 inches wide and doesn't involve the body parts listed above you can treat it as a minor burn. (it sounds as if your daughter has a small 2nd degree burn) you should call your doctor or go to the emergency room if the burn is larger than 3 inches or involves the body parts listed above. 3) third degree burn: is the most serious and the area may not hurt (from nerve damage) and can appear either black or white and dry. this needs emergent medical attention and you should call 911 or go to the emergency room. treatment of minor burns: 1) cool the burn by running it under cold water for 10-15 minutes or applying cold compresses (do not use ice). 2) cover the burn loosely with a gauze 3) take an nsaid such as ibuprofen for treatment of inflammation and pain relief. 4) do not apply butter or ointments. do not pop any blisters. 5) keep area clean and dry. watch for sign and symptoms of infection such as increased redness swelling drainage pain or fever. 6) once the burn has healed completely the best way to avoid scarring is to keep the area out of the sun for the next 6-12 months. sun avoidance is the single most effective way to avoid scarring. call your doctor with any questions.

i sprained my ankle almost a month ago ive been icing it and wrapping it w/ an elastic bandage it doesn't heal i can walk should i get it checked?
one thing you can do before you rush off to have it checked is stop putting ice on it. ice is good for the immediate injury but like all reducers of inflammation' it can have chilling effect on the healing rate. try applying heat and see if the increased blood flow doesn't help. ligaments have a poor blood supply so too much cold application can slow the blood flow and slow healing.

blisters can occur in some burns. it usually helps to run cold water over the area of the burn. application of silvadene (silver sulfadiazine) cream over the area can help in some pain relief and healing. it it is important to avoid infection.
why are cold compresses recommended for pain from a piercing rather than hot which would technically increase the blood flow and promote healing?

i keep getting colds from my mother who has type 2 diabetes. do i get colds from her because her immune system is weaker?
immune impairment is not as evident in type ii diabetes and thus i don't not believe that her immune status is the cause. i suspect that she has been in contact with a lot of people and particularly younger kids who are likely the source of the viral infection. in which case improved hand hygiene (washing hands after contact) may help solve the problem.

as so many have said previously it is not so much the wand as it is the magician. while smartlipo can be effective it essentially achieves reduction of fat by laser destruction. this can be done with suction or with ultrasound or wtih cold or with mechanical disruption. the laser may produce skin contraction but it also may produce a skin burn. it is probably better for highly localized fat.
i have had 4 colds in the last month. my bmi is 2( not sure if if makes a difference). do i have a weekend immune system and can i stop it?
it's more likely that you've have a lingering upper respiratory infection than 4 separate colds. also i believe you are calculating your bmi incorrectly. nevertheless if you are very under weight or anorexic malnutrition can certainly contribute to a weakened immune system. if you are concerned about recurrent infections you should get checked out by a medical provider.

there are many people of all body types thin or heavy that have asthma. obesity does not necessarily equal asthma. i am glad that you are under a doctors care and are being properly evaluated. weight loss can help breathing issues but obesity does not cause asthma.

what is brown fat? how is it different from other body fat?
brown fat produces heat to help maintain your body temperature in cold conditions. brown fat contains many more mitochondria than white fat. these mitochondria are the "engines" in brown fat that burn calories to produce heat. brown fat has generated interest among doctors and researchers for some time because it appears to be able to use regular body fat as fuel. and equally promising it looks as if exercise may stimulate hormones that activate brown fat. researchers are looking at whether brown fat's calorie-burning properties can be harnessed for weight loss. it's too soon to know whether these efforts will pay off. in the meantime be sure to include physical activity in your weight management plans.

i hear this often from men presenting with concerns about gynecomastia. because there are muscle cells in the areola surrounding the nipple stimulation or cold temperature may produce a contraction that makes the nipple more prominent but the areola flatter. with warmer temperatures the areola relaxes and may protrude. think about relaxing your stomach muscles and having your belly bulge out ward

how can i speed up my metabolism when i don't have a thyroid? do i have a metabolism? i'm taking armour thyroid and levoxyl (thyroxine). i'm eating right and walking everday but i can't seem to lose weight.
you could look to see if you're leptin resistant. you could assess this with a reverse t3 (liothyronine) test and if it is elevated you like are leptin resistant. if you follow some simple rules how to eat you will be able to activate your uncoupling proteins. humans have five total but the ones most important for weight loss are ucp 3 and ucp1. ucp1 is activated by temperature. this is why elite athletes sometime will train in cold environments to shred weight. mike phelps used this technique to win his gold medals. sherpa use this too but too when they guide people to everest peak but they offset it by eat straight lard during their ascent to keep their weights up. take a look at my leptin rx to help you start. ucp3 is the major one that allows humans to burn calories freely uncoupled from energy metabolism so you can lose weight.
how does coolsculpting work? i have heard about coolsculpting a lot lately but i only know its name and that it can be a non-invasive alternative to liposuction. while a non-invasive procedure sounds very appealing i'm a little confused about how that's
coolsculpting works by cooling fat cells down to a temperature that induces self destruction of the cells. the other types of cells in the treated area would require a much colder temperature to kill them and so coolsculpting is very safe. a vacuum pulls your skin and fat into the applicator and then 2 cooling plates cool the tissue down to the necessary temperature to "freeze" the cells.
how does coolsculpting work? i have heard about coolsculpting a lot lately but i only know its name and that it can be a non-invasive alternative to liposuction. while a non-invasive procedure sounds very appealing i'm a little confused about how that's
coolsculpting is the catchy name given to a procedure called zeltiq. zeltiq uses cold to damage the fat cells and reduce the amount of fat cells in the areas treated. it involves a special treatment head that is applied to your skin. the treatment head forms a seal on your skin and then cools the tissue to a very cold temperature. it gets the tissue cold enough to damage the fat cells but does not damage the skin. the treatment takes a little bit of time to complete in each area so if you want to do your whole midsection (for example) it could be many hours to complete the treatment. while you are being treated it is uncomfortable due to the cold temperature though tolerable. the claim is 20% reduction in fat after a three month period. i have heard both good and bad reviews but have no personal experience. i would say however that no non-surgical treatment will ever match the results of surgery (liposuction in this case). i hope this info helps! best regards adam j rubinstein md facs<link> [<link> chief section of plastic surgery jackson north medical centeractive member american society of plastic surgeonsactive member american society for aesthetic plastic surgeryactive member international society of aesthetic plastic surgeryfounding member american society of bariatric plastic surgeonsactive member american academy of anti-aging medicineconfidentiality notice: the information contained in this electronic message may be privileged and confidential and may or may not contain sensitive and personal information including identifiable health information the confidentiality of which may be protected by federal and state law and is only for the use of the individual(s) or entity(ies) named on address line(s)above. this electronic message in no way substitutes for medical or cosmetic advice. if the reader of this message is not the intended recipient the reader is hereby notified that any dissemination distribution or copying of this communication is strictly prohibited and the reader is requested to notify dr. rubinstein at 305-792-7575 or info@dr-rubinstein. com [mailto:info@dr-rubinstein. com] immediately and to delete the information. we assume no responsibility for consequences resulting from the information contained in this email.
how do i lose belly fat within a week i just got off the depo-provera shot in lost 4. 5 pounds with the help of wii fit for a hour twice a day but im not losing any stomach i also have not had a bm in like 2 weeks and also haven't had a cycle in 5 years du
it sounds like you are doing a good job with exercising. using the wii is a great idea. abdominal fatty tissue is very frustrating for many people. it also gets harder to lose in that area after we have children and when our hormones are fluctuating. things that can help: 1. drink plenty of cold water during the day 2. the higher fiber diet the better (this will also help with your bowel movement issue) 3. walk as much as you can every day losing weight is very difficult but it sounds like you are doing everything right. slow steady progress will help you. "spot exercises" for the abdomen unfortunately will not help; it takes overall body weight loss to affect the abdomen. but remember don't be too hard on yourself and just keep gradually working on this. the main goal is good health.
how can i prevent snoring at night?
snoring is caused by the airway being occluded during sleep by laxity in the throat or sickness such as a cold. there are some pillows you can get that help force a posture that aims to prevent this. if you are stopping breathing in the middle of the night this could be sleep apnea. apnea frequently causes snoring and can be evaluated by a physician.

have backed up water in my ear that won't dissapear and i've had a cold for a month. i tried everything.
a cold or other upper respiratory tract infection can cause the eusachian tubes to swell and not allow them to relieve the pressure in the middle ear. it feels likel there is pressure in the ear you can get fluid in the middle ear sometimes pain popping etc. a cold that last for longer than 14 days should be seen by a doctor. ear symptoms after a cold/uri can last up to 2 months.
have backed up water in my ear that won't dissapear and i've had a cold for a month. i tried everything.
assuming you have serous otitis media ( clear or amber fluid seen in middle ear space often precipitated by viral upper respiratory infections) the likelihood of spontaneous resolution at 4 weeks is approximately 60% 80% by 2 months and 90% by 3 months. in other words the longer one waits the greater the likelihood of it resolving on its own. most ent physicians begin to consider draining the fluid from the ear (myringotomy +/- tympanostomy tubes) after 8 weeks of persistent fluid. in an adult (where typically problems like this are less common than in children) and particularly if the problem is unilateral a nasophayngoscopy is important to rule out a space-occupying growth that may be interfering with normal eustachian tube function. patients with cold-like symptoms such as nasal drainage ear and nasal blockage may attribute this to a "cold" when in fact it represents a more serious problem. i don't say this to unnecessarily worry you only to highlight other things we as physicians consider. i would have an ent phsician examine you to put your mind at rest and treat you appropriately. in the mean time i would recommend a trial of topical nasal afrin for 3-5 days every 12 hours and attempt periodic gentle attempts at popping your ears (autoinsufflation) to try to open up the eustachian tubes.

had gastric bypass. i stay extremely thirsty but my blood sugar stays around 100. anything i can do?

some conditions can cause your body not to lose weight. low thyroid (hypothyroidism) for example can cause weight gain. losing weight is very frustrating. our bodies have evolved to try to keep weight on (from our ancestors who lived through famines). tips that can help include drinking 8 glasses of cold or iced water spaced throughout the day (if you have no medical reasons why you can't do it) increasing fruit/vegetables avoiding most types of fast food (it has high fructose corn syrup in it even the fries/buns/burgers) and gradually increasing how much you walk a day. trying to walk at least a mile a day can improve the metabolism. eating vitamin c foods such as grapefruit can increase the metabolism also. be sure you get enough calcium as some studies show this can help weight loss.

hip 2 foot leg pain sometimes foot turns ice cold. broke knee cap years ago not diabetic not over weight. cause for concern?
pain that radiates from hip 2 toes is usually caused by a pathology above the hip. your patella (knee cap) fracture most likely has nothing to do with this pain. your back is a likely candidate but your history of heart disease and the fact that your foot turns cold makes me think of a vascular (arterial) cause for your pain. i would definitely recommend you see a doctor to begin a workup.

look at all your options. there are many different types of cpap masks for example and many patients are much happier with nasal pillow type masks instead of full nose mouth masks. it's also a good idea to have an oral sleep apnea appliance(again there are many types) as a backup in case of power outages or head cold"s where you have a "runny or stuffed nose.

fat intolerant after inflamed gallbladder. on low fat/high fibre diet. lost 20lb. could this be the reason i've had constant bouts of colds/virus/flu for 2mths? (i hydrate/rest/exercise/eat healthy? )
but this is very improbable. you have simply been exposed to more illnesses and caught different viruses. dieting of this nature is not likely to affect your immunity adversely. by the way just because no stones were seen on the scan does not mean that there are not some there. you might want to chat with a general surgeon. that gallbladder may need to come out.
good day. please i need information on obesity. 30 hazards of obesity syndrome. 25 therapeutic measures for obesity syndrome?
is caused by overeating the wrong foods. it turns on a gene that influences the hypothalamus (brain). if you cease all forms of sugar you will lose weight but it has to be "cold turkey" and maintained. the gene also initiates inflammation in some obese people so the hazards come from inflammatory diseases such as arthritis.

studies done on both cold-water swimmers and hospital patients have shown that people with a higher body mass index (bmi) are less susceptible to hypothermia because fat insulates the body’s core. in people with a higher bmi subcutaneous fat effectively insulates the body’s core while the skin cools. some obese people feel cold in winter.
being overweight and experiencing right knee pain after walking too much for 5days and numbness while resting(same joint) should we see a doctor?
there is a good probability that the knee symptoms will improve with rest applications of cold alternating with warm compresses and if the patient can take them nsaids like ibuprofen help relieve inflammation. however if the knee is swollen very tender discolored or if the symptoms don't show gradual improvement then an orthopedic surgeon should evaluate the patient.
feet feels cold and feeling the need to wear socks. and to press on for warm up but when touched feel normal not cold not warm. obese. what could be?
if you have swelling in your feet and ankles there is a lot of water present. this absorbs any heat that you may perceive in the inside yet feels warm to touch. this water also overtakes the rush of warm blood in the tissues as far as temperature is concerned. obesity can cause occlusion of the lymph and return of blood towards the heart. neuropathy can also cause this perception.
for the last week my feet "feel" cold but are warm to the touch (37 yo female no dm2 22 bmi). family hx of shy-draggers. should i be concerned?
it is uncommon to have a bmi of 22 and type 2 diabetes. please let me know what your blood sugars have been and what medication you are taking.

how can i soothe sore breasts after giving birth?
putting cold cabbage leaves on your breasts inside your bra may help to relieve the discomfort. it may also help if you develop mastitis which is an infection some women get while breast feeding. even if you choose not to breast feed the cabbage leaves will help your breasts feel better as they go through the changes after giving birth. there are different opinions how long to use them 2 hours.
is it normal to have mastitis after weaning?
anytime you have milk sitting in the breast you can end up with mastitis. your doctor can give you antibiotics for the infection and using cold or heat packs (or cabbage leaves) can help with the pain. you may want to express some milk to help with the pain and give it by bottle or cup but the more stimulation you give your breasts the more milk and the longer you'll produce.
i have body aches headache and my right breast hurts a lot especially when breadt feeding. what could it be?

im 31. changes n period severe breast tenderness hot flashes/really cold fatigue headaches what could cause this? mom is post menapausal at 47
your symptoms are nonspecific to a particular condition. start with the basics : sleep nutrition and stress management. hot flushes may result from hypoglycemia and low thyroid (hypothyroidism). fatigue may be from both of these and poor sleeping (time and quality). see a caregiver who is willing to tackle the whole patient and not someone who will only test your hormones. good luck!

i have fibrocystic disease and at times my breasts really hurt during mammogram. does stopping caffeine help?
caffeinated beverages ( coffeee soda etc) have been shown to have significant correlation with breast tenderness in the case of fibrocyctic disease of the breast. stopping your caffeine intake may help reduce/relive the breast pain in general. in addition you may want to take nsaids for pain relief and also can try cold compress.

i had a breast biopsy for a benign tumor last year. why do i get pain from the scar? this happens when it's cold or when i'm feeling down or upset.
scar tissue will eventually soften and stop hurting. sometimes after a minor surgery there is an abnormal growth of scar tissue. if the discomfort continues i would return to your surgeon so he can reassure you that it is healing fine.
i had a breast biopsy for a benign tumor last year. why do i get pain from the scar? this happens when it's cold or when i'm feeling down or upset.
some times the nerve fibers in the skin get entrapped in a scar and cause pain. it is difficult to know the reason in your case without examining the scar. you may try massaging the area in a warm environment e. g. warm bath. see this site for more info. <link>
i'm a guy 18 6'1 tall 167lbs i think i might have gyno beacuase of my puffy nipples. my nipples burn when a cold breeze hits them or i'm at beach?
many young men have a mild case of gynecomastia with only puffy nipples. others have a more serious case. most require surgery for correction even mild puffy nipples. see my webinar on youtube - search dr. george pope. or visit www. gynecomastia. org a great forum.
i'm a guy 18 6'1 tall 167lbs i think i might have gyno beacuase of my puffy nipples. my nipples burn when a cold breeze hits them or i'm at beach?
your puffy nipples could be a form of gynecomastia or swollen due to irritation. in the first case having them raised up could make them more sensitive. in the second case your nipples may be more sensitive causing the body to react by swelling. there are many causes so an evaluation by your doctor may help determine the problem.
i am looking for nipple cream whichwill makes the nipple more erect?
i am not aware of a cream that can do this. nipple erection is caused by stimulation or exposure to cold. the only nipple creams that i am aware of are for cracked nipples due to breastfeeding.
how might a man detect breast cancer without going to a doctor?
know your body and any developing change. same for the ladies - vip- visual inspection in the mirror for nipple deviation retraction bloody discharge. palpation - feel for lumps or something "felt" on one side different from the other. and any change from your norm. and always ask the doctor even if being seen for something more trivial - a cold -this is your chance.
i'm wondering why are my 43yr old inverted nipples spontanously staying out?
hormonal changes is the most common cause for nipples to become erect. cold weather can do the same. at age 45 you should have a mammogram and a physical breast exam to rule out anything serious.
i have got puffy nipples for more than 3 yrs. when i bath or in cold it contracts. is this fat? it can be removed? and how? thank u
gynecomastia is the development of glandular breast tissue. if the "man boobs" have glandular tissue they sometimes respond to estrogen blockers like tamoxifen and reloxifine. if the tissue is fat medication will not help. surgery is an option but may not effect nipples.
can hypothyroid cause my breast pain?
mild hypothroidism is often asymptomatic. there are many possible symptoms of hypothyroidism depnding on the severity but common ones are: fatigue loss of energy lethargy wt gain decrease appetite cold intolerance dry skin hair loss sleepiness muscle/joint pain weakness in extremities depression emotional issues--just to name a few. breast pain is not. so consult your doc. good luck.

are breast lifts successful when they are combined with breast augmentation revision surgery? i need to have revision surgery for my breast augmentation because one of my implants bottomed-out but i'm not sure whether i should have implants again. will m
yes it certainly is possible but extra care has to be taken so that the implants can be supported in an aesthetic shape. this is exactly why i use the cold-subfascial technique. it allows lasting support to create a beautiful tear-drop shaped breast. if support is not returned the breasts will quickly bottom out and have displacement to the sides. using the fascia allows relocating the breast to an aesthetic place and shape that appears natural. all the best rian a. maercks m. d.
do you need surgery only once if you get breast implants? what happens to them as you age?
while it is certainly possible for an implant to last your lifetime without revision most women will have surgery again to correct changes associated with aging. the mst comon reason for frequent revision is implant malposition. with dua plane/submuscular placement implants tend to go down and to the sides. this is why i use the 'cold-subfascial breast augmentation' exclusively. it offers lasting support like a bra inside the breast.
i'm 16 and a guy i weigh 137pounds my height is 5'5 why when i'm cold my i got pectorals but when i'm warm i got man boobs?

dull pain on and of about two inches below my collar bone. on my left breast it comes and goes some days.
this sounds like costochondritis which means that you have some inflammation and pain of the fibrous joints of the anterior ribs just a short distance from the breast bone. it is usually very tender to press on the spot that is causing the pain. avoid over stressing with exercise lifting etc. heat/cold packs alternating may help. advil or aleve (naproxen) type meds help to reduce the inflammation etc.

you should see your doctor or a breast specialist. you need a good breast examination-to r/o infection or inflammation on your breast or other things-like mass/lump etc. you def need a mammogram and i think ultimately an mri of breast. meanwhile take nsaids and cold compress on your breast. depending on how suspicious it is perhaps a biopsy of the lymph node is needed. discuss with your md.

it is very uncomfortable and cumbersome but works in some patients. the hair loss during chemotherpay is completely reversible and usually 100 days after end of all chemotherapy your hair will grow back.

have had a cold yellow phlegm slight cough. normal to have pressure behind one ear with this? had breast cancer and am afraid of brain mets? !
so unrelated to brain. on the other hand without an exam i can only give general information but phlegm and cough can be a sign of beginning pneumonia if they continue. scary risky if someone's immune system is gone in context of serious chemotherapy/radiation.
i had breast implants 5 years ago. when i get cold my right breast hurts.
see your surgeon for better explanation.
i have inverted nipples and was wondering if that's normal and also why it occurs? it's something i'm really insecure about.
and can pop out (like with cold) then no it is a normal varient of zero concern. if it is both sides infection etc is just not at all likely. <link> a change in one nipple with other symptoms would be a concern. always being that way symmetric both sides without other problems not likely a problem.

my mom is having a double mastectomy done today and my fiancee has been sick with the common cold for the last two weeks. is it safe for her to be around my mother? if she wears a face mask?
it should be fine but use common sense - avoid prolonged close contact and use hand washing liberally. the cold should be winding down after two weeks anyway. you could consider a mask especially if there will be close contact but otherwise in not sure it will matter much. hope this helps!
my mom is having a double mastectomy done today and my fiancee has been sick with the common cold for the last two weeks. is it safe for her to be around my mother? if she wears a face mask?
the common cold is usually harmless but in the case of your mother who will be just out of a large surgery i would suggest she avoid your fiance till he is over his cold.

the scrotal dartos muscle contracts in response to cold pushing the testes closer to the warm body. testis microcalcifications are likely not significant. we used to make a bigger deal of them but research has shown this was probably overblown. you'll feel better when you get out of the cold water.

unlikely a heart attack @ your age unless you have cardiomegly. ever had a chest x-ray that said your heart was enlarged? or does it run in your family? pneumonitis if you have been doing cardio in cold weather. pericarditis and pulmonary embolus are rare possibility. a lot of times we never find a reason for the symptom and it goes away on its own. sometimes all u can do is rule out the bad stuff.

any tips on how to wean toddler from nursing? don't want mastitis but ready to stop.
weaning exclusively breast fed infants can become a bit drawn out affair mainly due to dependence at some level mostly for infants but for some mothers as well. cold turkey is a harder than gradual method. in the former infants scream a bit longer but it is amazing how smart their little brains can be to figure out they need to rely on other sources for their survival. d/c night feeds fir

i have inverted nipples they come out only during cold or stimulation. i also hv saggy breasts. is it normal? m a virgin. will pregnancy correct this?
normal to have inverted nipples. common in women as well as men. not sure what hv refers to but 'saggy' breasts could be due to size or normal genetics. if it's a cosmetic issue you could address it with a plastics doctor. pregnancy will make your breasts fuller but generally with age and after pregnancy your breasts may develop stretch marks or lose more fat so might be worse hard to say.

my left eye has been hurting and red for about 3 days now and i have put reg eye drops but not helping iam on medication for my heart does this means i could be have another heart attack or stroke
hello there are a number of possible reasons that you left eye could be red & painful. conjunctivitis is an inflammation of the surface of the eyeball and is commonly known as "pink eye. " it might just be from irritation to the eye or allergies. if it is caused by a virus or bacteria it could be quite contagious. your eyes could be bloodshot because they are irritated by a variety of things like wind dry air cold exposure dust etc. the fact that your eye is red and painful by itself does not mean that you are having a stroke or a heart attack. what would be of particular concern would be eye pain with a change to your vision. if that occurs i would recommend being seen right away. because you have a complicated medical history if this does not resolve fairly quickly i would notify your doctor.

you have irritated/strained your ribs and they are now "crunching" each time you cough. it is not exactly true but i call this "microfractures" of the ribs. it will likely clearly up soon. other much less likely possibilities exist. likely take as needed 1-2 advil + 1 tylenol extra strength for (just) several days: can be taken up to twice a day (less is more). i also like topical soothanol

pain in chest is common after repeated coughing bouts. this could more than likely be attributed to muscular pain of the chest wall. however if you are finding it is difficult to breathe as well with pain on deep breathing then this is likely due to inflammation of the sac which surrounds the lungs. this is called pleurisy and may need further investigation and treatment.
my many docs believe inappropriate sinus tach but what do you think? -fast heart rate(resting 100-190s) -dizzy -low and high bp -cold feet -tremors

my tsh is 0. 99 but the dr said that i have a goiter. i have cold feet. unexpected weight gain. dry skin. palpitations. carpal tunnel. 29 yr old female?
tsh of 0. 99 suggests normal thyroid function. i dont have your free thyroxine level to confirm this. your symptoms are non-specific. unfortunately when patients have the classic symptoms of hypothyroidism they only actually have it 30% of the time. that speaks to the lack of specificity of the symptoms you are having. again though a t4 level would be needed to rule out central hypothyroidism.

have lupus& pots. got bad respiratory virus & both the lupus & pots flared causing me to miss multiple days of work. how 2 prevent flare from virus?
sorry to hear about your debilitating flare ups. there are many things that can trigger a lupus flare up. you should consult your rheumatologist for a specific action plan. for a respiratory virus i want to emphasize prevention. good diet vitamins if not exercise as tolerated adequate restful sleep reduce stress hand hygiene and avoid touching your face avoid anyone who may have a cold.

i had a cold for 4 weeks. now get sharp chest pains when i cough or sneeze. i've always had back pain-is it referred pain? chest xray was clear.

my doctor performed an ecg test and found i had short run of pac. she referred me to a cardiologist. what could cause this? is it serious?
it is not a disease. everyone has pacs - sometimes we put them together into runs. if your heart is otherwise healthy (as your cardiologist will determine) then it's not at all serious. alcohol nicotine caffeine lack of sleep stress cold medicines asthma medicines are all common causes. rarely xs thyroid hormone is the culprit. in the majority of cases there is no reason at all!

sudden dizziness arms felt cold nausea and feeling faint so went to er. ekg normal chest x-ray & brain ct & blood tests ok but low potassium. sent home. can low potassium cause these symptoms?
your symptoms & the rapidity with which everything seems to have come on speaks in favor of what we refer to as a vasovagal reaction. for some reason you suddenly had a stimulation by the vagus nerve of your cardiovascular system which would've dropped your blood pressure & heart rate by a fair amount. since you were sent home from the er i'm sure your potassium wasn't that low to be of concern.
sudden dizziness arms felt cold nausea and feeling faint so went to er. ekg normal chest x-ray & brain ct & blood tests ok but low potassium. sent home. can low potassium cause these symptoms?
potassium usually needs to be pretty low to cause dizziness and the ecg would be abnormal in that case. the question to be answered is why is the potassium low? meds? diarrhea? endocrine problems? thorough history and good physical exam probably has the answer.

if i was seeing you in a clinical setting i would first be asking you many questions to make sure that you were not someone who was highly likely to be having a heart or lung issue. even if unlikely i would still be likely to obtain an ekg. if you passed the first screening questions and ekg was normal most likely explanation for your problem is mucus congestion. also consider gerd allergy

this is a normal heart rate for a 5 and half years old child. now a common reason for fast heart rate in children is fever common colds and dehydration. children tend to drink and eat less when they are not feeling well and eventually become dehydrated. make sure that your child had adequate fluid intake control fever if any with tylenol (acetaminophen). if the problem persist then consult with his doctor

hi doctors. 22 years old i've been going through a lot of anxiety for 2 months usually a very healthy person. as of late i've had a lot of heart palpitation at a normal beat and very strong but i feel a fluttering feeling as well like a buzz?

helena sensations such as you describe can be due to high levels of anxiety. have you noticed any pattern to these sensations? do they occur after eating or drinking? do they awaken you from sleep? how long has this been happening? have you tried any other anti-anxiety meds? if these sensations persist get a checkup from your md to rule out physical disorders. if all ok talk to psychologist.
had cold symptoms 6 days they have gone now just feeling dizzy and my chest feels tight/itchy with cough no mucus?

im getting sick really bad head congestion. what over the counter cold remedies can i take? im on 25mg beta blocker and 120mg of ccb for heart rate. 19?
you're rather young to be on 2 medications for your heart rate. i suspect you have a predisposition of some sort. maybe wolff-parkinson-white (wpw) syndrome? that needs to be worked out before any advice is given. use healthtap prime or talk to your doctor for advice. most otc cough/cold sprays & meds have phenylephrine which can cause your heart to race. saline nasal sprays are safest. good luck.
lately when i try to go to sleep i feel like my heart is going to stop or im gonna stop breathing like im having a heartattack is it a heart attack or panic attack? i have had them before just sitting around the house but never when im going to sleep
you may be experiencing panic attacks. panic attacks usually last ten minutes or less. some possible symptoms which might make you think you are having a panic attack include: chest pain or chest tightness; a pounding or rapid heartbeat rapid or difficult breathing nausea sweating or numbness / tingling in your lips or fingers/ toes. people often believe that they are having a heart attack during an episode of panic. other symptoms can include feeling very afraid and / or anxious; trembling feeling really hot or cold or feeling dizzy or faint. if a person wakes up in the middle of the night gasping for air then they might be experiencing sleep apnea. i can not diagnose you. you should see your doctor for a full medical evaluation to ensure that these symptoms are not due to a medical condition. if you do in fact have panic attacks there are medications which can be prescribed to help and you can also see a psychologist to learn ways to control or prevent these symptoms that do not require medications. good luck.

rapid heart beat at rest reason to call doc?
normal hr at rest is around 60-100 bmp. sometime emotional excitement even when you are resting it can be a bit fast. also if you have taken some cold medicine/decongestants or too much caffeine/energy drinks or all of the above together can really speed up your heart. asthma medicine--albuterol etc. can increase hr. so if u have no reason for fast hr consult doc. good luck.

your particular case. without an exam i can only give general information. and irritation of the muscles/joints in the chest (costochondritis) would give pain that moving those parts would trigger. reflux disease or other gastrointestinal one is often triggered by cold/sharp/spicey/acidic/large volume foods. relieved by ant-acids.
think the cold weather caused a episode of afib is this possible and why?
your af is not likely caused by cold stimuli but in patients prone to af cold stimuli such as breathing in cold air or slugging down cold liquids can precipitate an episode. cold stimuli cause surges of "vagal" nervous stimulation to the heart which in some people is a trigger to precipitate af. avoid such cold stimuli if you notice this pattern and also avoid heavy isometric straining.
have had a chesty cough and cold since last wednesday and it has calmed since sunday i have had acute and painful left sided chest pains what is it?

hands swell at night pain is so terrible last night i also had tightness in my chest today i'm tired could it be flu or a cold coming on?

hands swell at night pain is so terrible last night i also had tightness in my chest today i'm tired could it be flu or a cold coming on?
the symptoms sound worrying. chest tightness and arm swelling may be unrelated however there is always a slight possibility of thromboembolism or clots in the deep veins and lungs. the simpler explanation may be that you are developing carpal tunnel syndrome in your hands. in any case you need to be seen by your doctors urgently to make sure there is nothing requiring urgent intervention
i always sweat heavily during sleep even room is cold. have fast heartbeat restlessness and feeling headaches before during and after sleep. normal?
night sweats are not normal but if you have no aircondlting and it is hot then may be normal. are others sleeping with you sweating as well?
last 2 days i have had palpitations when walking around. a few seconds each time about 20 times a day. had a ecg recently and all normal. any ideas?
a normal ecg does not rule out rhythm problems. are you taking any prescription medications or over the counter cold medicines? how much caffeine do you take? since your symptoms are intermittent i would recommend wearing a holter monitor - a 24-48 hour recording of every heart beat. a heart echo to evaluate the heart for any structural abnormalities would also be a good idea. ask your doctor.
lthead @stand up skin cold/clammy w/exercise hand+feet swell/hot@bed ice-cold@day random flushing freq cold intol. not 2/2 anx. nl ecg/echo. what?
the next "round" of testing woyld include a 24hour heart monitor to rule out any arrythmia. a full metabolic workup is necessary to exclude endocrine causes. ( cortisol sugar thyroid) a 24 hour urine should be done to rule out carcinoid and pheochromocytoma. lastly a neurologic evaluation to rule out autonomic dysfunction.
lower than usual bp and heart rate. bp 95/65 normally 110/73. heart rate 58 normally 78. low iron. lightheaded blurred vision dizzy. no cold or flu.
first thing i'd wonder about is whether you're taking a beta-blocker for migraines or mitral-valve prolapse or some other reason. your symptoms are consistent with that. if not something else is slowing down your heart which would be no big deal if you had no symptoms. you should get this checked out in a timely fashion.

taking z-pac for cold/cough and w/in 3 hrs developed pink eye. used ofloxicin from prev condition and 12 hrs later hives red rash on back gone in 2 hr?
most colds and coughs don't need antibiotics. you may well have a virus and the zpak will not speed your recovery if so. unless the prescriber told you bacteria are likely present due to high fever or white count or exam. eye drops do not remain sterile after opened and should be discarded. this is why! check back with your doctor if symptoms get worse or do not get better.
trouble breathing dry mouth despite lots of water headache hot face heart palpitations throat tightness lymph near neck enlarged. any thoughts?
"trouble breathing" means one needs to see a doctor because it can be many things such as an allergic reaction a heart problem pneumonia etc. . trouble breathing can also be due to asthma-type symptoms if the person is prone to getting such problems with any cold flu allergy or strep symptoms. in some cases trouble breathing can be due to huge tonsils or a tonsillar abscess.
three years ago i passed out. the next day i went to work and felt like i was going to faint again. i was rushed to the hospital and almost went into cardiac arrest. xanax was their answer. i have been on xanax for 3 years. i want off! it's a bandaid?
it sounds like the xanax (alprazolam) actually worked to prevent fainting; the likely cause was anxiety. and you are correct. there are other effective treatments for anxiety: usually a form of cognitive behavioral therapy which would take a lot of commitment/practice from you. go ahead and pursue this but taper slowly off the xanax (alprazolam) only under careful supervision from your doctor. cold turkey is dangerous!

what does it mean when a regular tilt table test is normal but you crash on one with isuprel? bp and hr tanked saw spots shivering cold and nauseous
the test results suggest that the body's automatic nervous system overcompensates for the stimulus of the isuprel a drug that speeds up the heart. the overcompensation slows the heart too much and lowers the blood pressure and there is syncope (fainting) or almost fainting. this called neurocardiogenic syncope or vasovagal syncope. there are several drug treatments.
woke up today w bad cough no sputum (non-productive) that causes chest pain. minor trouble breathing runny nose temp 99. 2 f. cold or bronchitis?
a cold is an upper respiratory infection. acute bronchitis is also an upper respiratory infection. i would say you have both: acute bronchitis caused by a cold. the risk is that you may have a lower respiratory infection (i. e. pneumonia) - the fever is the worrisome sign. you need to be seen by your doctor asap. sometimes antibiotics really are needed!
had hypertension emergency reaction to pseudoephedrine. ever since chest pain &terrible blood flow. is this endothelial dysfunction? whats treatment?
blood vessels are lined by cells call endothelia. they make chemicals that both relax the vessels (vasodilator) & constrict them. usually the chems are kept in balance. in some individuals the endothelium has a bias or predisposition to one or the other. the slightest thing can set it off. in your case pseudoephedrine causes walls to overly constrict raising blood pressure. avoid otc cold meds
i am a 29 year old female i'm having slight chest pains that come and go i have had it for more than 24 hours now should i be concerned?

my chest hurts when i cough. i have a cold coming on. what are ways to reduce this discomfort?
pain in chest is common after repeated coughing bouts. this could more than likely be attributed to muscular pain of the chest wall. however if you are finding it is difficult to breathe as well with pain on deep breathing then this is likely due to inflammation of the sac which surrounds the lungs. this is called pleurisy and may need further investigation and treatment. otc cough syrups may help

it depends on why you were taking it. if for palpitation they may return if for high blood pressure it may go up unless you are on other medications if for anxiety it may return. if you have asthma and propanolol was making it worse your asthma may improve. would call you doctor and discuss the reason why he stopped it and if you should slowly taper it off rather than cold turkey. .

i assume you have been to the er and were discharged. a serious cause for your symptoms seems less likely as your initial tests were normal. among the less serious causes for such symptoms is the possibility of a chest cold and superimposed panic attack with hyperventilation. but if your symptoms persist you need to be re evaluated to determine the proper diagnosis. return to the er if needed.

the symptoms of always feeling cold especially if accompanied by dry itchy skin brittle hair and feelings of sluggishness constipation and fatigue are characteristics of a low thyroid metabolism. these symptoms are best evaluated with a total t4 free t4 total t3 and free t3 and reverse t3 as well as a thyroid antiglobulin study ultrasound of the thyroid and a competent examination by a thyroid specialist or endocrinologist. what is more troubling from the venous point of view is your history of two episodes of dvt in 2 years. this is a very serious condition which can lead to long term disability from chronic venous insufficiency and or obstruction of the common femoral and or popliteal vein and may result in chronic leg swelling darkening of the skin at the ankle and chronic ulceration. this also also has the potential to travel up into the pelvic veins and even break off and be carried to the heart and lungs as a pulmonary embolus. i strongly suggest that you should see a phlebologist or another physician with special knowledge of dvt and clotting abnormalities and determine if you have a congential or acquired hyper coagulable state (thromobphilia condition) which predisposes to recurrent dvts. a series of blood tests (coagulopathy panel) can determine if you have inherited one or more of these genetic risk factors that might explain your problem: factor v leidin protein c protein s prothrombin g20210a mutation elevated factor viii antiphospholipid antibodies apc resistance antithrombin activity. lupus anticoagulant and hyperhomocyteinemia {mthr abonrmality}. other acquired predisposing factors include oral contraceptive and estrogen containing products undiagnosed occult malignancies and prior history of trauma to your veins or even chronic varicose veins. this is a complex problem and you should try to see a specialist either through your insurance plan or through a free clinic at a teaching hospital where duplex ultrasound and other resources can be used to assess the gravity of your condition. in the meantime if your leg is swollen and you do not have any arterial disease you may want to consider wearing a graduated elastic compression stocking (preferably thigh high) with a 20 to 30 or even a 30 to 30 mm hg gradient may give you some relief from the symptoms of swelling and this may help to prevent another episode of dvt. compression stockings stronger than 20 mm hg gradient should only be dispensed through a licensed professional. aspirin is not a sufficient preventative medicine and your specialist can advise you whether you may be better off considering life long anticoagulation or whether you condition doesn't merit these additional risks.

what is neuropathy and can it be cured? dizziness very disoriented. tingling hands fingers feet and also swelling water retention feels like i'm drunk cannot walk straight very much afraid of falling i feel like i'm tilting more to one side.
"neuropathy" as a term is usually used to describe or label diseases of the peripheral nerves so it is also often called "peripheral neuropathy" to emphasize that this is not a term to use to describe diseases of the brain or spinal cord. there are many types of peripheral neuropathy and several ways to classify them based on whether the major systems involved are those which provide nervous system input to muscles (motor neuropathies) those that are involved in sensation such as touch pressure heat cold pain etc (sensory neuropathies) or those that are involved in control of involunatry functions such as maintenance of blood pressure sweating and bowel and bladder function. there are mixed neuropathies pure motor neuropathies pure sensory neuropathies etc. equally there are classifications by cause (etiology) such as diabetic neuropathy (which is usually a sensory neuropathy but may involve motor problems or autonomic problems in some patients) or ischemic neuropathy (neuropathy caused by insufficient blood supply to some nerves). some neuropathies have a genetic basis others are acquired. some are due to other diseases involving nerve secondarily such as diseases in which the immune system attacks blood vessels producing vasculitis which then can produce ischemic neuropathy in the affected nerves. this often produces a clinical pattern called "mononeuropathy multiplex" meaning multiple nerves are involved one at at time with no pattern whereas a lot of other types of neuropathy as i have described above are "polyneuropathies" involving multiple nerves usually in symmetric patterns such as in what is called a "stocking and glove" distribution. so the causes are different and some are identifiable and curable others are not curable but are treatable and some are difficult to treat. so this is a long answer to your main question about "what is neuropathy". some of what you describe could be a peripheral polyneuropathy: tingling sensations in your hands and feet feeling "drunk" which may mean your sense of where you are in space is not working well leading to a feeling that you may fall. however as dr krob suggested "dizziness" swelling and water retention and disorientation are not commonly associated with neuropathy and could suggest that you have a serious medical condition which needs prompt evaluation and treatment. some of these might also cause neuropathy; so to pick just one possibility (not to say you have this) there are diseases called "collagen vascular diseases" such as lupus which may damage the kidneys producing water retention swelling of the legs feet and hands and this may also affect nerves by causing vasculitis giving you the tingling and perhaps also the "feeling like i'm drunk". so see a physician very soon.

can someone explain telemetry monitoring? what is a telemetry floor? my mother was a cardiac patient with a pacemaker and type 2 diabetic with an abnormal ekg and elevated cardiac enzymes. she was found unresponsive and cold and had suffered a m. i. she a
her abnormal ekg and elevated enzymes indicate that she probably came into the hospital with an mi. anoxic encephalopathy can occur as quickly as 2 - 4 minutes or potentially even less depending on her condition prior to the arrest. a telemetry floor is where patients are placed so that their heart rhythm can be monitored continuously either by the nurses on the floor or a specially trained technician. a telemetry box attached to ekg leads on the patient transmits the rhythm strip wirelessly to a central monitoring station. training in interpretation of ekg's is usual for nurses on such a floor. on a telemetry floor response to an arrest will be much quicker than in a situation where the heart rhythm is not monitored. arrests can still happen though since the heart rhythm may continue for a while after a patient stops breathing or even insome instances after the heart stops pumping blood.

child with fever heart racing 2 yr old daughter. rectal fever 105. third day with fever. during day she plays seems fine. been on steady doses of tylenol and motrim. currently doing cold presses popsicles. should we be at er? her heart rate was at 150.
since your child's temp is up around 105f you should either call her doctor or go to the emergency room. fevers for the most part aren't dangerous and are just the body's natural reaction to fighting off an infection. most of these infections are viral and may be accompanied by runny nose sore throat congestion mild rash or nothing at all. since fevers aren't dangerous we usually treat the fever with acetaminophen or ibuprofen just to make the child more comfortable as their body fights the illness. "red flags" that we look for with fever to indicate something more serious is going on are: -fevers that last 5 days or more -fevers persistently above 104f orally or 105f rectally -a child that acts very sick - very irritable or difficult to wake -difficulty breathing -vomiting diarrhea refusal to drink or dehydration -a purple rash esp on the legs -stiff neck -any complaints of pain such as the ear throat stomach or a joint as always use your judgement. if you think that your child is ill err on the side of caution and call your child's doctor.
