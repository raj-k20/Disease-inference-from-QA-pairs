i was treated for cellulitis with antibiotic but after weeks it's still swollen. is it normal?
is it your leg? it is very common that other conditions are mistaken as cellulitis. then the antibiotic is no help. stasis dermatitis and erythromelalgia are 2 examples of conditions presenting as red- swollen skin but are not infections. also there may be an underlying problem such as lymphedema which leads to cellulitis. then it is useful to address the underlying condition to prevent another ce.
patient @ skilled nursing. sudden inflammation of both legs. hot to touch. they cleared dvt via echo. they denied cellulitis. i say it is! what testin?
erythromelalgia or stasis dermatitis. edema? take calcium channel blocker?
palpitations/nausea/tachycardia (especially standing/after meals/after waking up) weak toes turn red/hot when standing. whats wrong? doc doesn't know
thyroid disease or erythromelalgia are considerations.
