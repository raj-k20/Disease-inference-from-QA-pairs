it is unlikely that some doctors online who have never actually seen you to evaluate you are going to have insight that your treating physician hasn't had. i sure wish you the best.
what is the correct eye drop for red eye high blood pressure?
i would not reccomend any eye drops until a complete ophthalmologic exam is performed. there are many reasons why one may have a red eye. 1. allergy 2. infection 3. iritis 4. episcleritis 5. sub-conjunctival hemmorhage 6. glaucoma. each of these diagnosis would require a different form of treatment an immediate exam is warranted.
scared! i had a positive ana twice 1:40 and 1:160 nucleolar pattern only symptoms have been mild dry eye and one possible episode of episcleritis in the last year. i am scared i have diffuse scleroderma. been to several rheumatogists and dermatolog
i would recommend treating the dry eye and continuing followup with your rheumatologist. if you have no other findings it does not sound like you have criteria to diagnose diffuse scleroderma or any other autoimmune disease for that matter. positive ana testing with mild dry eye is actually pretty common.
