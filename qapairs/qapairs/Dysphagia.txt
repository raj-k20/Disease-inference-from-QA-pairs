how does esophyx compare to nissen fundoplication in terms of efficacy and safety? i have bad gerd and laryngitis. which should i do?
both are good. the nissen is 90-95% successful but has a relatively high side effect profile (up to 60% in some studies) for bloating and trouble swallowing. the esophyx is 80-85% successful but only has about a 2% bloat and dysphagia rate. a hybrid tif can be done to fix the hiatal hernia laparoscopically then do the transoral wrap with the esophyx device. talk to a surgeon who does both.

sore throat lethargy x3 days. ok to breathe/swallow neg strep & xray fast pulse. er gave steroids & motrin for visible epiglottis. should i worry?
i'm not sure how they saw your epiglottis in the er but if they think you have epiglottitis you should have been hospitalized. do you have fever? you are likely dehydrating which may cause the fast pulse. strep is only one test. were you tested for infectious mono? if there is suspicion of epiglottitis (low prob given no dyspnea or dysphagia) i would suggest coverage for hib. see your pcp.
