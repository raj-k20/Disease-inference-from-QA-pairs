a very fouly smrll whitish yellow small thing came into my mouth from oesophagus i guess. this happens mostly after overeating. is this food reflux?
you cold have an esophageal diverticula in which food gets trapped starts to digest (decompose- can be foul smelling almost fecal) and coughing could bring it out. i would think a barium swallow or upper endoscopy could clarify pretty quickly.
