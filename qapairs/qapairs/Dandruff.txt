dandruff/hair loss. for instance if you have ringworm infection hair loss and bald spots can develop. it is necessary to treat the infection with an antifungal medication. a topical or oral treatment may be required. only then can healthy hair grow and cover the bald spots. see a dermatologist who can evaluate your scalp and give you proper therapy

it sounds asi f you have a condition called seborrheic dermatitis. not uncommon but annoying. shampooing often preferably daily with one of the over-the-counter tar shampoos such as t-gel tarsum dhs-tar should help your scalp. over-the-counter hydrocortisone creams used very spearingly twice daily for a week or two should help the ears and the face. if no better see a dermatologist.
