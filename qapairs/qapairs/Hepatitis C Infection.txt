is hep c curable as i have a paper cut on thumb i can't tell whether its bleeding or not i don't know if the hep c girl that knocked has open wound?
hepatitis c takes more contact to transmit- contact with the blood of a person with hep c infection in contact with your blood puts you at greatest risk for hep c infection. hepatitis c infection can be treated with a combination of antiviral medications. more effective protocols are being used to clear infection. check out the cdc website on hepatitis c for more information.
i am on oxycodone 10/325 but recently diagnosed with hepatitis c. what would be a good long term treatment for my chronic back pain?
an even better strategy - given the meds now available - would be to treat and quite probably cure the hepatitis c infection. . once it has been confirmed by the appropriate testing (i. e. an antibody test alone is insufficient). you need an hcv pcr and a genotype test to work out what to do next. then of course avoid the behavior that led to the infection. see a hepatologist (liver specialist).
