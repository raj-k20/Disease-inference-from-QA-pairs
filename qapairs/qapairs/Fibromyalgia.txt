hand swelling after exercise can be as simple as dependent swelling (swelling due to hand position during exercise) or more complicated (obstruction of venous blood flow return trauma arthritis) -- for now elevate the hand and avoid ibuprofen (tylenol (acetaminophen) ok) -- if it persists make an appointment with your doctor! if there is severe pain go to the er.

recommend rice therapy (rest an ice-pack and elevation). an anti-inflammatory medicine may also help-but it should be cleared by your doctor since these can cause side effects or interact with other medicines. finally if it doesn't improve you should be evaluated to make sure you haven't broken a bone.

your problem of overeating seem to be psycological which you say is related to fibromyalgia. first of all i hoppe you have been diagnosed with this condition and being treated for the same with proper meds. you should keep a diary of the foods you eat and consult a nutritionist and also a therapist to guide you to type of foods you are consuming and if there is a psycological problem to be treated.

do you usually bruise easily or are you taking any medication that can predispose you to bruising like aspirin or coumadin (warfarin)? i ask this because from your description it sounds like you may have broken a little blood vessel. raynaud's will usually cause blanching and whitish appearing skin not so much blue and in those rare cases where blue discoloration is association with lack of blood supply the blue tends to be at the end of the toes not the middle of the top of the foot. if it doesn't clear up in another day or so i'd show it to your doctor. feel better.

i'm the only 1 in my immed & extend family w/ hypothyroid psoriasis fibromyalgia auto-immune rosacea & overweight etc. why & are they related?
hypothyroidism and possibly psoriasis (the jury is still out) may be considered autoimmune but not rosacea or overweight condition. being overweight increases your body core temperature and thus worsen rosacea. as for fibromyalgia we are still in the dark on the mechanism. belly fat also makes one more prone to inflammation.
i'm the only 1 in my immed & extend family w/ hypothyroid psoriasis fibromyalgia auto-immune rosacea & overweight etc. why & are they related?
obesity especially severe obesity causes inflammation which can sometimes cause symptoms of diseases like fibromyalgia. additionally new studies show that obesity may actually cause a relative hypothyroid state (as opposed to the traditional idea of hypothyroidism causing weight gain). there is also some overlap of inflammatory and autoimmune causes for diseases and much still to learn.

the safety of silicone filled breast implants has been verified by the us food and drug administration after years of studying their use in the us. they were used in europe and the rest of world the entire time they were banned in the us. they were found not to cause connective tissue diseases like lupus fibromyalgia etc but their use in patients who already have these conditions is not recommended. they were allowed back into the us after years of careful study and clinical trials. breast implants may enhance a women's appearance but like any medically implanted device may eventually require replacement removal become infected or develop a scar contracture. the decision to have breast implants should be thoroughly discussed with a surgeon certified by the american board of plastic surgery and a member of the american society of plastic surgeons.

carbs are fermented on the small bowel. a low carb diet eradicates this and minimizes the only macronutrients not needed for life carbohydrates. my patients who have gone in this direction improve. this is observational. no studies exist at present that fully support this. however consider the per capita consumption of sugar is 37lb/ american & 28. 6lbof corn syrup. up 5x from 1950.

hello. i don't have a diagnosis for your symptoms. most breast cancers aren't tender. i don't know if you are fair skinned or have had very much sun exposure. please check the mole for the following. this information comes directly from the american academy of dermatology. asymmetry: if the mole has asymmetry (one half is unlike the other half). border: the border is irregular scalloped or poorly defined. color: the color is varied and has shades of tan brown or black; is sometimes white red or blue. diameter: the diameter is more than 6 mm (the size of a pencil eraser). evolving: a mole or skin lesion that looks different from the rest or is changing in size shape or color. if you have an irregular mole that itches bleed or is painful that can be worrisome for possible skin cancer. you said it started discharging- dont' know if that means a purulent drainage. because you described it as large as a baloon with (purulent? ) drainage& swelling and you are experiencing weakness it would be prudent that this be evaluated at an er (especially if there is any fever). your description raises a number of concerns - this could be an abcess that has opened up and is draining or this could be a mole that has changed. because it could be an abcess and because it a breast lesion recommend that this be evaluated by a general surgeon.
