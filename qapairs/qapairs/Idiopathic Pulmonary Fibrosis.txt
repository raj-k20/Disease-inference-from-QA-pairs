what is pulmonary fibrosis? is there a cure for it?
pulmonary fibrosis is a loose term. treatment depends on the kind. idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (ipf) has a poor prognosis. pirfenidone is the only drug approved for ipf in most of the world except the us.
what is idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis?
ipf is a dangerous condition where scar tissue replaces normal lung tissue choking off normal air units and causing breathlessness. it is a progressive disease with no effective treatment at present.
what is idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis?
it's a disease characterized by thickening of the membrane of the lungs causing difficulty of the oxygen molecule from passing into the blood. symptoms are usually related to shortness of breath and cough. cause is unknown.
what is idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis?
idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (ipf) is a progressive unrelenting scarring of the lungs. this results in low oxygen levels respiratory failure and eventually death.
what are the end life symptoms of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis?
progressive shortness of breath and inability to sustain normal o2 levels are common end of life symptoms. sometimes the right side of the heart fails causing lots of leg swelling and fatigue.
what are the end life symptoms of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis?
at the end of life pulmonary fibrosis patients mainly develope severe shortness of breath/dyspnea. this results in very high oxygen needs and very limited exercise capacity. many patients become chair bound or bed bound toward the end of pulmonary fibrosis. the national life expectancy for patients diagnosed with pulmonary fibrosis is 50% at 2 years (after diagnosis).
what's the relationship between interstitial lung disease and pulmonary fibrosis?
interstitial lung disease is an "umbrella" term for many diseases; one of these disease is idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis or ipf.
what's the relationship between interstitial lung disease and pulmonary fibrosis?
interstitial lung disease and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis are different terms for the same disease. fibrosis means scar tissue in lay terms. for unknown reasons fibrous tissue begins to replace normal lung causing difficulty breathing. at present there is no effective treatment although it is an intense area of research and many new drugs are being studied.
what is the treatment for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis?
unfortunately there are no good effective treatments for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. many have been tried such as steroids anti-inflammatory drugs and a drug called mucomyst (acetylcysteine) but the studies done have not shown significant efficacy. treatment is mainly supportive.
what is the treatment for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis?
currently there is no approved treatment for ipf. prednisone is still used but data has failed to change the course of the disease. several products under trial pirfenidone has shown some suggestion in the progression of disease not currently approved. current trials using stem cells is under way. supportive treatment with oxygen and bronchodilators may be helpful.
what is the treatment for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis?
there are currently no successful therapies for ipf including lung transplantation. steroids imuran (azathioprine) and acetlcysteine were tried as a combo therapy with worse survival for the treatment arm. exercise and oxygen may provide some benefit. several new drugs are currently in evaluation but none have shown great promise except for marginally slowing the disease process.
what are the tests for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis?
the "gold standard" test for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis is a lung biopsy usually via lung surgery. but nowadays ct scan has gotten very good at diagnosing ipf and sometimes this is enough. but usually lung biopsy is required to make a diagnosis.
what are the tests for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis?
pulmonary functions ct chest labs to rule out other etiologies include: ana rheumatoid factor hypersensitivity pneumonia panel sedimentation rate ace level
what is pulmonary fibrosis like?
idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis is an inflammatory process affecting lung parenchyma and resulting in loss of lung storage and resulting in low diffusin capacity and restrictive lung disease. cardiovascular effect inckude pulmonary hypertension and cor pulmonale. the disease is slowly progressive and unresponsive to all current therapy. lifespan can be in months(hamman-rich) to a few years.
what are the symptoms of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis?
slowly progressive shortness of breath chest discomfort cough with exercise declining exercise capacity. at advanced stages weight loss leg swelling frank chest pain simulating angina.
what does it mean when idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis found?
idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis means that there is scarring of the lungs and the underlying reason for the scarring is not known. it is typically a slowly progressive disease typically over years. at the final stages consideration of a lung transplant can be made so avoid smoking to insure that you would be a candidate if it progresses to that stage.
what is between ipf versus pulmonary fibrosis?
pulmonary fibrosis is when the lungs become scarred. there are many causes of pulmonary fibrosis. ipf idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis is one disorder that causes this scarring. in ipf the reason for the pulmonary fibrosis is not known.
what is the treatment for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis?
unfortunately there are no effective treatments for ipf. currently n-acetyl cysteine and perfenidone are being studied but at this time no effective treatment has been found.
what is the treatment for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis?
no effective medical therapy available. the only available treatment is lung transplant. ask your lung doctor if you are a candidate for lung transplant. enrolment with clinical trial with pirfenidone or n-acetylcysteine is an option.
what is pulmonary fibrosis? and how is it described from an x-ray? i was told i have hardening of the lung does this mean i have it?
pulmonary fibrosis is a loose term used for numerous interstitial lung diseases. most often though it is used for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (ipf). x-ray will not be a good modality to evaluate ipf. a ct chest will be helpful.
which of these are restrictive: obstructive pulmonary diseases are asthma chronic bronchitis and emphysema?
airway "obstruction" refers to limitation of air flow through the airways. "restriction" refers to processes that keep the lungs from opening fully when you inhale. restriction can result from fibrosis or thickening of the lung as with diseases like idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. it can even be from something as simple as obesity or muscle weakness that keeps you from breathing deeply.
what is pulmonary fibrosis? is it often fatal or just chronic?
pulmonary fibrosis is essentially scarring of the lungs. there are many different causes for the lungs to scar. the disease can be a long-term chronic problem however in certain cases if the underlying cause of scarring is not addressed it can be fatal. furthermore idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis is almost uniformly fatal. lung transplantation may be a final resort.
what can cause pulmonary fibrosis?
pulmonary fibrosis is essentially scarring of the lungs. there are many different causes for the lungs to scar. the disease can be a long-term chronic problem however in certain cases if the underlying cause of scarring is not addressed it can be fatal. furthermore idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis is almost uniformly fatal. lung transplantation may be a final resort.
sure i've heard of pulmonary fibrosis. but now that my child may have it i want to know what it really does to the body.?
on the cause of the fibrosis; may processes causes lung scarring (fibrosis). some are well understood (e. g. asbestos) and others are under investigation but not yet clearly understood (ipf/uip or so called idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis). each cause of fibrosis has a different outcome and some have treatments while others do not (other than transplant).
