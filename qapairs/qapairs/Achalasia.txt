why do i need to have a barium swallow test before i get a nissen fundoplication?
to ruleout esophageal cancer or motility disorders of the esophagus such as achalasia. . may also need manometry studies.
what is the difference between hiatal hernia gerd and achalasia?
simplistically a sliding hiatal hernia is a common upward bulge of stomach (with acid) thru the diaphragmatic hiatus (hole in diaphragm thru which esophagus & stomach connect). gerd is physical movement of stomach contents into the esophagus often associated with esophageal inflammation that can progress to esophageal cancer. achalasia is motility disorder of esophagus and its lower sphincter.
what is the difference between hiatal hernia gerd and achalasia?
hiatal hernia is an anatomical problem gerd is a functional problem with the valve between the stomach and esophagus being "too loose" and achalasia is a problem whereby the esophagus doesn't function at all due to loss of nerve function. the normal valve between the esophagus and stomach then becomes stiff making swallowing food progressively more difficult.
what is the difference between hiatal hernia gerd and achalasia?
hiatal hernia is a hernia at the esophageal hiatus through the diaphragm. gerd is acid reflux from the stomach into the esophagus. achalasia is hypertrophy/ stricture at the distal esophagus. gerd can be associated with both hiatal hernia and achalasia but more so with hiatal hernia.
what is the difference between hiatal hernia gerd and achalasia?
herd is a symptom of hiatal hernia achalasia a a nesophogeal motility disorder when part of your stomach is in your chest the sphincter of the end of the esophagus dosent work as well to close off the esophagus-.
what is the difference between hiatal hernia gerd and achalasia?
hiatal hernia is when the stomach goes up in to the chest because the hole in the diaphragm for the the esophagus stretches out. gerd is abnormal reflux of stomach contents into the esophagus typically causing heartburn and regurgitation. achalasia is when the esophagus doesn't work to propel food through the esophagus and in to the stomach.
who is not a good candidate for nissen fundoplication?
if the operation won't help the symptoms or meet the patients goals it shouldn't be done. while this cannot be predicted with 100% accuracy a careful history along with tests of the upper gi tract can maximize the chmaces for success. it should not be done in patients with achalasia. gastroparesis that is mild and has predominantly gerd symptoms may benefit from nissen. severe gastroparesis not.
who is not a good candidate for nissen fundoplication?
initial considerations are a person's general health and risks for surgery and anesthesia. other indications to avoid surgery would be gastric or esophageal muscle disorders (gastroparesis achalasia) scleroderma and those whose symptoms are not from reflux disease.
should fundiplication be done? manometry shows achalasia in 10 yr old grandson. dr recommends cutting muscle along with fundiplication. is that best?
cutting the esophageal sphincter muscle which is the primary and most definitive treatment for achalasia usually causes reflux so a fundiplication should be done to prevent reflux. this is especially important in a 10 year old who hopefully has a lifetime to live with the adverse consequences of reflux. you have gotten good advice!
should fundiplication be done? manometry shows achalasia in 10 yr old grandson. dr recommends cutting muscle along with fundiplication. is that best?
the myotomy or cutting the muscle is the most important part of the procedure. it's often helpful to do a 24 hour ph study to see if there's reflux. only 10% of patients with achalasia have reflux. they absolutely need the fundoplication. if the operation is done laparoscopically you must do a fundoplication regardless. it's a technical issue. if it's done through the chest no fundoplication.
should fundiplication be done? manometry shows achalasia in 10 yr old grandson. dr recommends cutting muscle along with fundiplication. is that best?
generally the operation that would be curative of this condition. if you have any doubts you should seek a second surgical opinion.
how successful is a laparoscopic myotomy and fundoplication for achalasia?
laparoscopic myotomy and anterior or dor fundoplication is the most common surgical procedure and has 85-95% success rate at 5 years. there are some centers in the us that perform myotomy without abdominal incisions via an endoscopic approach called per oral endoscopic myotomy (poem).
how successful is a laparoscopic myotomy and fundoplication for achalasia?
if you truly have achalasia a laparoscopic myotomy can provide improvement in your symptoms almost instantly. the long term satisfaction from the surgery is also very good.
can sleep apnea cause achalasia?
whatever position is more comfortable. osa can be suggested with underling obesity/small oral airway/collar size>18. the definitive test is a psg with split night/cpap titration. i would request copy of sleep study and get a second opinion if you are not satisfied with the options. cpap can be difficult to tolerate. ent for upp eval. vs hyoid suspension. no corelation with achalasiaia
can sleep apnea cause achalasia?
no.
when i eat food my throat tightens badly seemingly from being twisted by a motility disorder. i also get chain spasms and chest pain. no acid reflux.
sounds like you may have achalasia diffuse esophageal spasm or nutcracker esophagus. see your dr for motility studies as this can be treated with meds.
what are the benefits of the treatments for achalasia?
the goal of treatment for achalasia is to improve swallowing and avoid complications such as weight loss and malnutrition. the newest and likely most effective treatment is per oral endoscopic myotomy (poem). this is offered in springfield ma chicago portland or san diego and long island to name most of the centers performing this procedure.

usually surgery is not required but esophageal dilation is first line treatment.
what are the different operations to treat "achalasia"?
botox injection may give temporary relief but makes subsequent surgery much more difficult. endoscopic balloon dilation is effective but requires at least two treatments and if there is a perforation surgery will be required emergently. surgical myotomy is usually performed laparoscopically but is now being performed at several centers in the u. s. endoscopically referred to as poem.
what are the different operations to treat "achalasia"?
the main goal of any treatment for achalasia is to relieve your symptoms botox injection - no good. balloon dilation - need at least two treatments overall success approx. 70-80% 2-5% risk of perforation. surgery - more invasive overall success 90% <1% perf rate poem - (per oral endoscopic myotomy) newest endoscopic operation may be best.
what is achalasia?
this is a progressive disorder of the esophagus in which the esophagus no longer has the ability to push food into the stomach and at the same time the lower esophageal sphincter pressure is increased. the most common symptoms are difficulty swallowing and regurgitation. symptoms may be confused with gerd. diagnosis is made with endoscopy x-rays and esophageal manometry.
what is achalasia?
inability of esophagus to move food down toward stomach. may be neurological or infectious in origin. some autoimmune causes as well.
what is achalasia?
basically the esophagus doesn't work to propel the food into the stomach in a coordinated fashion because the nerves that coordinate this function don't work. cause is typically unknown but probably related to a viral infection somehow. treatment is directed at opening the lower esophageal valve to relieve the symptoms (no cure for the nerves). the newest treatment is poem.
what is the treatment for esophageal achalasia?
the main treatments are 1) medications 2) endoscopic and 3) surgical. which one to choose depends on how severe the symptoms are.
what is the treatment for esophageal achalasia?
medical treatment is with calcium channel blockers. endoscopic treatment is with balloon dilation of the lower esophageal sphincter but typically has to be repeated several times. surgical treatment is a heller myotomy. your gastroenterologist can help you decide which treatment is best for you.
what is the treatment for esophageal achalasia?
all treatment for achalasia is aimed at permanently opening the valve entering the stomach. the most ineffective is botox injection. endoscopic dilation is ok but not as good or permanent as surgically opening the valve usually done laparoscopically. endoscopic myotomy (cutting the muscle) is becoming more available. it is called poem - per oral endoscopic myotomy.
what is the treatment for esophageal achalasia?
there are alternatives but surgery (heller myotomy) is the best and most lasting treatment. it can be done with minimally invasive techniques and recovery is fast.
what is the treatment for esophageal achalasia?
currently there are multiple options for treating achalasia. medications have limited success. endoscopic treatment (via a flexible scope passed from the mouth into the esophagus) can be used to dilate (balloon pressure) or temporarily weaken (botox injection) the lower esophageal sphincter. surgery involving laparoscopic release of the sphincter (myotomy) is a very good option for most patient.
what do you recommend for esophageal achalasia?
although there is no definite cure several therapies have been shown to be effective - dilation of the esophagus certain medications such as nitroglycerine nifedipine may be helpful and finally if all fails especially esophageal dilations surgery.
what do you recommend for esophageal achalasia?
for healthy patients surgery (heller myotomy) is the best and most long-lasting treatment. alternatives include endoscopic dilation and botox injection at the lower esophageal sphincter. while these can also work their effect is typically short-lived.
what do you recommend for esophageal achalasia?
endoscopic balloon dilation is less invasive but slightly more risky and less effective than surgical myotomy. there is a new endoscopic method for myotomy called per oral endoscopic myotomy (poem) being done in a few centers in the us.
what kind of pills or treatment can somebody get for esophageal achalasia?
the only effective treatment is to open the lower esophageal valve by balloon dilation or surgically through the abdomen or the mouth (poem). pills don't work nor does botox.

you can speak to your doctor about trying reglan (metoclopramide) or metoclopramide but cautiously and in small amounts since you have to worry about side effects. this a motility agent that might help and also there could be a stricture in esophagus that might need to be dilated per upper endoscopy perhaps as well.
what symptoms do people with cardiospasm usually have?
the disease is known as achalasia where the esophagus doesn't push the food down in to the stomach. symptoms are classically the sensation that food is stuck in the chest. patients are usually the last to finish eating at the table and sometimes have chest pain due to esophageal spasm. hope this helps.
what is achalasia?
achalasia is a motor disorder of the esophagus. achalasia is characterized by two things: 1) failure of relaxation of the sphincter between the esophagus and stomach when swallowing 2) no normal mobement of the esophagus. best treatment is minimal invasive surgery (or robotic) cutting muscle and a partial "wrap" procedure called heller myotomy with fundoplication.
what is achalasia?
achalasia is where the esophagus does not function to propel food into the stomach. because the valve entering the stomach usually only opens when it gets a signal that food is coming from the esophagus it tends to rarely open due to this lack of function of the esophagus. the valve then gets stiff and prevents passage of food into the stomach. treatment is aimed at permanently opening the valve.
what is achalasia?
achalasia is a disorder of the muscles of the esophagus leading to swallowing problems. it usually has two components: 1) failure of propulsive ("peristaltic") contraction of the muscles of the body of the esophagus; and 2) failure to relax of the lower esophageal sphincter (the outlet of the esophagus into the stomach). both lead to obstructive symptoms and gradual dilation of the esophagus.
what is the difference between achalasia and gerd?
achalasia is a disease of the esophagus where the nerves coordinating function don't work and the esophagus cannot properly propel food down to the stomach. gerd is a problem with the valve between the esophagus and stomach whereby it permits stomach contents into the esophagus.
what is the difference between achalasia and gerd?
achalasia is a motility disorder in which the esophagus can't coordinate its muscles and trans port food corectly. this can cause food to be stuck and regurgitation. gerd is when gastic contents including acid can reflux back into the esophagus. the gerd can be caused by achalsia.
what are the symptoms of achalasia?
difficulty swallowing regurgitation reflux weight loss vomiting endoscopy is performed to exclude a malignancy of the esophagus. x-rays often demonstrate a narrowing or birds beak of the distal esophagus. manometry is diagnostic. laparoscopic surgery with a heller myotomy is highly effective treatment.
what are the symptoms of achalasia?
this is a narrowing of the esophagus which can be very painful. it is usually associated with painful and difficult swallowing of both food and liquids. sometimes it can be treated by dilating the esophagus to reduce the pain and narrowing. you should see a gastroenterologist for further treatment.
what are the symptoms of achalasia?
usually difficulty swallowing sensation foid is stuck in the chest occasionally associated with intermittent chest pain and weight loss. most effective and most invasive treatment is surgically cutting the muscle of the valve that can be done laparoscopically or endoscopically (poem).
what are symptoms of achalasia?
with both solid and liquids and usually throwing up undigested food. of course similar symptoms can be caused other conditions as well including esophageal cancer so proper work up is required.
what are symptoms of achalasia?
this is the medical term for difficulty swallowing. slow eating being the last one at the table and weight loss are also common. intermittent chest pain can also occur from spasm. it is also common to have the sensation that the food is sitting in the chest not going in to the stomach. bad breath can also occur due to food staying the esophagus for a prolonged period of time.
what does the surgical procedure of achalasia involve?
which means cutting of the muscle sphincter at the bottom of the esophagus. a partial "wrap" or anti reflux procedure is usually added.
what does the surgical procedure of achalasia involve?
surgically cutting the muscle fibers of the lower esophagus valve between the stomach and esophagus and the top of the stomach is usually done through the abdomen with a technique called laparoscopy. there are a half a dozen centers or so in the us performing this procedure endoscopically without abdominal incisions with a technique called per oral endoscopic myotomy (poem).
what is the definition or description of: esophageal achalasia?
this is a disease that destroys the nerves coordinating esophageal muscle contraction. the normal ability to push food into the stomach is lost and the valve entering the stomach becomes tight and stiff allowing food to collect in the esophagus and empty by gravity alone. solids generally worse than liquids. onset is gradual. weight loss & malnutrition common. treatment directed at opening valve.
what is the definition or description of: esophageal achalasia?
achalasia is an esophageal motility disorder. it is diagnosed by manometry showing a lack of relaxation of the distal esophagus and decreased peristalsis. primary achalasia (most common) is due to loss of inhibitory neurons in the distal esophagus. secondary achalasia is caused by chagas disease. "pseudo-achalasia" is seen with cancers. surgical treatment remains the gold standard.
what does shooting side pain on the left side of the chest mean?
chest pain can come from many causes. at your age more common causes include musculoskeletal pain; pulmonary problems like asthma or pneumonia; gi problems like reflux gastritis achalasia. the heart can also be the source of chest pain in adolescence but it is very rare. a detailed history & physical exam with your pcp will be important. depending on those further testing may be recommended.
