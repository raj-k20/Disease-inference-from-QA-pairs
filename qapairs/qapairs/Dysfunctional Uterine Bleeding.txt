i've been bleeding brown blood for over two months no real pain not dizzy not having sex or taking birth control. somewhat overweight what is it?
most likely you're having dysfunctional uterine bleeding which means that your hormones are a little out of whack resulting in too much buildup of the uterine lining and subsequent bleeding and spotting. it can usually be cleared up using progesterone pills. i would see your doctor.
