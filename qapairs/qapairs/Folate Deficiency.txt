if rda's for b-vitamins are achieved with whole food is it possible to still have high homocysteine and if so does it indicate gut dysbiosis?
there are some known reasons for high homocysteine including genetics folate deficiency (some don't list this as a b) and who-knows-why. as a lab specialist i'd urge you not to pay much attention to this number. there's a rare genetic syndrome in which it's way-high but most of us are not impressed that a mild elevation's a risk factor for anything. "gut dysbiosis" is dubious stuff. cheers.
