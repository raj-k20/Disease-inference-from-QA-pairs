eczema disorder and i have heard that a gluten free diet can help?
the rash that is caused by gluten enteropathy is very specific. it is called dermatitis herpetiformis and it consists of clear blister-like bumps on your elbows and knees/shins that itch intensely. eczema is usually related to regular allergies not celiac disease although a person can have both at the same time. if you are wheat or grain-allergic the diet will help but not because of gluten.
