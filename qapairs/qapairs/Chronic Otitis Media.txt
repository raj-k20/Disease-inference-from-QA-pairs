how'd i get polyps in my ear that keep me from hearing well?
you most likely have chronic otitis media which is a chronic middle ear infection. you need to see an otolaryngology professional and obtain a hearing test and a ct scan. you may need surgery. at the least you will need to be on dry ear precautions. antibiotic ear drops and antibiotics and steroids by mouth are also used.
