in a healthy heart can strong emotions such as fear anger anxiety and a rxn to a natural disaster cause a heart attack or cardiac arrest? <negative_smiley>
there is a condition caused "broken heart syndrome " where someone can get cardiac arrest from severe stress or emotions. it is quite rare but it can happen. it is caused by the surge of stress hormones like adrenaline that can be released from severe stress. i must stress - no pun intended - that it is rare but it can happen and i have seen it happen.
in a healthy heart can strong emotions such as fear anger anxiety and a rxn to a natural disaster cause a heart attack or cardiac arrest? <negative_smiley>
"acute stress cardiomyopathy" is a condition which mimics heart attack. it can cause severe heart complications including heart failure and death. the diagnosis is generally made by the history (a sudden severe emotional or physical stress followed by chest symptoms) and the finding of heart muscle dysfunction (often in takotsubo pattern) and no coronary artery occlusion to explain it.
in a healthy heart can strong emotions such as fear anger anxiety and a rxn to a natural disaster cause a heart attack or cardiac arrest? <negative_smiley>
need other issues-atherosclerosis and risk factors smoking obesity sedentary lifestyle diabetes etc.
in a healthy heart can strong emotions such as fear anger anxiety and a rxn to a natural disaster cause a heart attack or cardiac arrest? <negative_smiley>
although very uncommon sudden cardiac arrest has occured in people with healthy hearts when sudden severe emotional trauma has occurred.

can you go into cardiac arrest if you take too many diet pills?
drug abuse can be very detrimental to your heart. stop it and see your doctor. good luck!
can you go into cardiac arrest if you take too many diet pills?
ed. also electrolyte abnormalities may contribute.
hello doctor lately i'm experiencing some pretty scary cardiac arrest symptoms after eating too much sugar--chest pain tingles down left arm spasms?
arrest are rapid heart beats dizziness and loss of consciousness. not what you are describing. sounds like you are having a sugar high. chest pain tingles and spasms sounds like anxiety. for reassurance you should see a health care provider and have testing to exclude cardiac issues. then you need to make better life style choices.
you can survive from heart attack but cant from cardiac arrest right?
cardiac arrest is survivable if promptly dealt with~! many defibrillators are available now and people who know cpr (cardiopulmonary resuscitation) save many lives from cardiac arrest each year once in the hospital cardiac death is highly unlikely! hope this helps happy healthy new year dr z
my mom went in2 cardiac arrest & brought back but on life support -before her brain died completely could she hear me telling her i love her please?
it is likely that she heard you. i guess it was her time. i tell the loved ones and staff that are within earshot of my patients who are in a coma to assume that everything they say can be heard and understood. if they cannot hear then nothing is lost through such acts of kindness.
my mom went in2 cardiac arrest & brought back but on life support -before her brain died completely could she hear me telling her i love her please?
unscientifically i think as long as your mom had any brain function she sensed your presence & your love on some level. if it makes you feel better watch how often the " long island medium" tells people exactly what they did at their loved ones' last moments allegedly having been informed by the deceased. unfortunately i don't know how one would confirm or refute that but it's comforting.
what is the difference between cardiac arrest and cardiogenic shock?
cardiac arrest means the heart has stopped working electrically. cardiogenic shock means the heart muscle has stopped working
what could cause a cardiac arrest after a sinus arrest?
sinus arrest is usually followed by a junctional escape or ventricular escape beat. if no escape mechanism took place and a sinus impulse didn't appear then cardiac arrest would be possible. practically this is a rare event unless the heart is very sick.
wanted to know if cardiac arrest survivors live a long life?
if they are treated correctly and the source of their cardiac arrest is determined and treated they may have the same life expectancy as anyone without a cardiac arrest. that said data indicate that having one statistically does reduce survival but it depends upon the cause and subsequent treatment.
what is the difference between a cardiac arrest and a heart attack?
with arrest. heart attack usually caused by blocked vessel.
what is the difference between a cardiac arrest and a heart attack?
a heart attack is when the heart muscle is not getting the blood supply it needs. the part of the heart not receiving enough blood is at risk to die. cardiac arrest is when the heart stops beating entirely. one of the many causes of cardiac arrest is a heart attack or myocardial infarction (mi). both are life-threatening and require an immediate 911 call.
what is the survival rate of cardiac arrest?
both in the hospital and away the survival rate is often less than 50%. hospital rates are lower related to the severity of disease seen there.
what is the survival rate of cardiac arrest?
no one survives cardiac arrest unless they're successfully resuscitated. prognosis then depends on the cause of the arrest whether it's reversible how long there was no spontaneous circulation the underlying condition of the heart whether there was preexisting cerebrovascular disease presence of preexisting kidney disease what the general health was and other factors.
what can cause sudden cardiac arrest in young people?
cardiac arrest in young people is most commonly cause by an abnormal rhythm that originates from the pumping chamber of the heart (ventricle). heart attacks are a rare cause for cardiac arrest in young people.
what can cause sudden cardiac arrest in young people?
incidence: 1 in 280 000 unscreened.
what does sudden cardiac arrest feel like?
no blood flow to brain causes syncope- fainting. with luck the fall causes heart to beat! at least a few til someone calls 911 and starts cpr.
what does sudden cardiac arrest feel like?
a cardiac arrest is equal to the heart stopping. there is no blood flow to the brain and the victim faints. there are no pulses no breathing and no verbal response or movement from the victin. if you think someone is having it call for help and begin cpr (chest compressions) while the victim is lying flat on their back.
what is the difference between a mi and a cardiac arrest?
a myocardial infarction is an event caused by a blockage in an artery which damages the heart muscle. a cardiac arrest is an event that may be caused by a myocardial infarction or may be caused by other events such as respiratory failure or electrolyte abnormalities which causes the heart to go into an unstable rhythm. in this rhythm the heart cannot pump effectively so treat the cause.
what is the difference between a mi and a cardiac arrest?
in an mi heart muscle is damaged in a cardiac arrest the heart stops beating. either one can cause the other.
what is the difference between sudden cardiac arrest and cardiac arrest?
a few seconds perhaps critical problem.
what is the difference between having asystole and cardiac arrest?
cardiac arrest means that the heart is no longer beating and this can be due to different rhythm disturbances. one of the rhythm disturbances that can lead to the heart stopping is asystole when there is no electrical activity present (ie "flat line" on the heart monitor! ).
what is the difference between having asystole and cardiac arrest?
asystole is only one kind of arrhythmias that causes cardiac arrest.
what is the difference between an mi and cardiac arrest?
infarction is loss of heart muscle (dead tissue). arrest is heart stops beating.
what would doctors do if they went into cardiac arrest during an operation?
if i had an intraoperative arrest i would hope the anesthetist and surgeon would do chest compressions bag valve mask me and treat the cause of the arrest. physicians have many opinions on how they want to be treated themselves.
what would doctors do if they went into cardiac arrest during an operation?
if a patient goes into cardiac arrest during surgery cpr would be done and medications given as well as "shocking" the heart if the heart rhythmn warrants it. this is done in accordance w/ advanced cardiac life support protocols. now if the doctor is the one in cardiac arrest someone else would need to resuscitate the doctor (i don't think that is your question however! ).
what would doctors do if they went into cardiac arrest during an operation?
a phsician should receive the same care as a pt even in an or. attending staff could step in and cover while care for the stricken physician proceeds.
what causes cardiac arrest?
cardiac arrest may occur in the setting of acute myocardial infarction profound refractory shock or electrical heart problem.
what causes cardiac arrest?
cardiac arrest can be caused by many problems with the heart. the most common is a heart attach which can cause fatally abnormal rhythms when the heart is starved for oxygen. arrests can also occur from abnormalities in the electrical system of the heart; from drugs or toxins; and from abnormalities of electrolytes particularly high and low potassium.
what can you do for someone who has a sudden cardiac arrest while playing soccer?
start cpr.
what can you do for someone who has a sudden cardiac arrest while playing soccer?
call for help. while help arrives you can start cpr. if there is a aed(automatic external defibrillator) available have someone who is qualified use it asap.
what can you do for someone who has a sudden cardiac arrest while playing soccer?
first call 911. if the person has no pulse you would initiate cpr. classes are available to train you in the technique but the 911 operators can also talk you through it so cpr can be done while awaiting for the 911 rescue personell to arrive at the scene.
what are the complication of myocardial infarction?
there are a range of possible complications. the heart is a muscle and can be weakened by a heart attack and lead to heart failure. the heart has a conduction system which can be damaged and can lead to arrhythmias and cardiac arrest. many people die from their heart attack while others have one and don't realize it. unfortunately about 1/2 of the time the first sign of heart disease is death.
what are some of the benefits of electronic pacemakers?
depending on what is being treated it can prevent fainting and premature death from slow heart rates or cardiac arrest.
what is the use of automated external defibrillators?
aeds were developed to make it easy for nonprofessionals to provide emergency defibrillation to cardiac arrest victims. they are made with simple to follow directions so that the potential for bystanders to save a life using them is present.
is oxycodone the same as oxycotin. can oxycodone given at 325mg cause hyperkalemia and cardiac arrest?
oxycontin is a brand name for oxycodone. it is a schedule ii controlled substance. the most common side effects are nausea vomiting dizziness or headache. most serious side effect is respiratory depression or arrest. the "325" you mention is not the oxycodone dose. must be the acetaminophen (tylenol) content. stay under 4000mg/day of acetaminophen to avoid liver damage.
is oxycodone the same as oxycotin. can oxycodone given at 325mg cause hyperkalemia and cardiac arrest?
oxycontin is a longer release version. usual dosage 10 to 80 mg tablets.
is it possible for a patient on an external pacemaker to still die from cardiac arrest?
ventricular tachycardia or fibrillation or full arrest can still happen. the external or internal pacemaker will continue to fire but is ineffective.
is it possible for a patient on an external pacemaker to still die from cardiac arrest?
sometimes the pacemaker is not sufficient to prevent other types of arrhythmia. for example if one gets venytricular fibrillation external pacemaker would not help.
is it possible for narcan (naloxone) to reverse opiate overdose once a cardiac arrest has occurred?
if resuscitation succeeds yes.
is it possible for narcan (naloxone) to reverse opiate overdose once a cardiac arrest has occurred?
it is indeed possible. in fact this is precisely the point of the medication. once a cardiac arrest has begun however removing the effect of the opiate does not necessarily guarantee the end of the cardiac arrest. often additional treatment is required.
is it possible for atrial flutter to cause cardiac arrest?
cardiac arrest is a term when the heart can't pump any blood. atrial flutter rarely causes this problem unless there is very fast conduction into the lower part of the heart or if the atrial flutter degenerated into another rhythm condition (this may occur in patients with significant structural heart disease).
is it possible for atrial flutter to cause cardiac arrest?
atrial flutter is when the atrium beat 2 3 or 4 times for every time the heart beats. you run a small increased risk of stroke because blood will pool in the atrium and shoot to the brain later on. i have no heart of a case where aflutter caused a cardiac arrest.
if someone's heart stops suddenly from a severe infection such as sepsis would a defibrillator get the heart working again? or no because of the bacteria
if someone has severe sepsis or septic shock they can go into cardiac arrest. if it is due to ventricular fibrillation a defibrillator shock will sometimes correct the rhythm problem. other treatments would need to be used if the heart stopped due to asystole. once the heart rhythm was stabilized the doctors would have to continue to treat the patient for the underlying infectious process.
i'm on benicar. toprol (metoprolol) xr. omeorazole. synthroid. and ativan. will any of these possibly cause my arrythmia v-fib. or cardiac arrest?
no.
i'm on benicar. toprol (metoprolol) xr. omeorazole. synthroid. and ativan. will any of these possibly cause my arrythmia v-fib. or cardiac arrest?
they help to prevent it. check with your doc.
is xanax (alprazolam) better at treating panic disorder than ativan or klonipin? & is there any possibility it causes any cardiac effects? cardiac arrest arrythmia
it is more potent during the panic attack due to its rapid onset of action although with all those meds. there is potential for abuse dependency & withdrawal. any of them at doses higher than recommended daily dose or if taken along with other meds. that adds to their effect can lead to respiratory depression & cardiac problems. close monitoring by a qualified physician is strongly advised.
is xanax (alprazolam) better at treating panic disorder than ativan or klonipin? & is there any possibility it causes any cardiac effects? cardiac arrest arrythmia
any of these can cause cardiac arrest or arrhythmia especially if overused. xanax (alprazolam) is shorter-acting ativan is a little longer-acting so it can build up more in your system. while none of these are safe for long-term use i would say that xanax (alprazolam) is the safer of the two.
is asystole the same thing as cardiac arrest?
is a calf a cow? if you are making veal parm? cardiac arrest is the loss of pumping ability of the heart. that is measured as cardiac output (units l/min). in cardiac arrest it is 0. asystole is usually used to refer to the lack of electrical activity in the heart. if the electrical system could be measured it would be measured in amps (current or electrons /sec). in asystole that is 0.
is asystole the same thing as cardiac arrest?
for all practical purposes.
i understand what asystole is but how different from cardiac arrest?
cardiac arrest means that the heart muscle has stopped beating. it can be from asystole which means that there is no spontaneous rhythm at all or other causes. but in the end cardiac arrest means the heart stop beating.
i understand what asystole is but how different from cardiac arrest?
asystole and cardiac arrest are synonymous.
is ventricular fibrillation the cause of cardiac arrest?
it is the most common heart arrhythmia associated with cardiac arrest. it is not exact to call it the cause since ventricular fibrillation itself has an underlying cause most commonly coronary artery disease but there are others.
is ventricular fibrillation the cause of cardiac arrest?
ventricular fibrillation is a cardiac arrhythmia that results in the heart being unable to circulate blood. thus there is no pulse with this rhythmn. however there are other cardiac rhythmns that also result in cardiac arrest.
is ventricular fibrillation the cause of cardiac arrest?
broadly speaking there are 2 causes of cardiac arrest: ventricular fibrillation and asystole.
is ventricular fibrillation the cause of cardiac arrest?
in most cases yes
if 60 and blood pressure and cholestrol are under control can you still have cardiac arrest?
blood pressure and cholesterol are risk factors for coronary artery disease it is possible to have these risk factors under good control and still get heart disease for example one can have diabetes and smoke. in any case controlling bp and cholesterol is a good start and lowers ones risk significantly.
if 60 and blood pressure and cholestrol are under control can you still have cardiac arrest?
cardiac arrest can result from many many factors some of which are not under our control. living a healthy lifestyle makes this less likely but not impossible.
if 60 and blood pressure and cholestrol are under control can you still have cardiac arrest?
think about this: we will all die someday. when we do we will surely have a cardiac arrest. some people die before age 60. some of those people lived healthy lifestyles and were unlucky. there are no guarantees in life and we don't come with a warranty. sorry for the reality check. live each day like it's your last. carpe diem. (the romans were thinking about this fact 2000 years ago).
i want to know my options for treating cardiac arrest?
your only option is to decide in advance. either you want to be resuscitated or you wish have a "do not resuscitate" order/ advanced directive.
i want to know my options for treating cardiac arrest?
if this happens hopefully you are at a place with equipment and personnel to rescue you. there is nothing you can personally do when you have a cardiac arrest. you can however make your feelings and preferences for rescue efforts known in advance in a document called the living will.
is synchronized cardioversion the most effective treatment for cardiac arrest?
synchronized cardioversion implies that a regular and organized cardiac rhythm is present. most patients with cardiac arrest have ventricular fibrillation. cardioversion of ventricular fibrillation does not require synchronization. in the case of ventricular tachycardia where a regular rhythm is present synchronization is required.
is synchronized cardioversion the most effective treatment for cardiac arrest?
most cardiac arrests are treated with defibrillation. cardioversions are used for arrythmias rapid heart rate) where the person still has a pulse and is awake but is rapidly deteriorating (losing consciousness short of breath chest pain) and the cardioversion syncs with the person's rapid heart rate. in cardiac arrest the person is unconscious and has no pulse and the heart is in v-tach/fib.
is synchronized cardioversion the most effective treatment for cardiac arrest?
no not if ventricular fibrillation. . under that scenario synchronization is not required.
i have hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy. how can i cope with this?
to understand and deal with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy may be treated in a variety of ways to avoid a sudden cardiac arrest. however i would connect with information on the website for the hypertrophic cardiomyopathy association www. 4hcm. org. this might provide some helpful resources for you.
is there brain function during a cardiac arrest?
cardiac arrest means- heart not beating hence no blood flow/ circulation- brain does not function when there is no blood supply.
is there brain function during a cardiac arrest?
when the heart stops circulating blood to the brain the functions of brain cease after about 5 minutes. if cpr is performed the brain function can return. however prolonged cpr may not get enough blood to brain to prevent brain damage even if heart recovers.
is there brain function during a cardiac arrest?
the brain is highly reliant on adequate blood flow and oxygen so the longer there is a cardiac arrest the more likely permanent brain damage will occur. the point of doing cpr is to maintain at least some flow to the brain that hopefully will allow recovery when the heart performance can be re-established.
if someone has a heart attack do you use an aed first or do chest compressions (cpr) first?
aed and chest compressions are performed in the setting of cardiac arrest- i. e. when the heart is not beating well enough to provide blood to the rest of the body. this is apparent because the patient will be unresponsive and will not have a pulse. heart attack refers to a blockage of one of the arteries in the heart which typically causes chest pain but not unresponsiveness.
is an aed useful in effectively treatment for sudden cardiac arrest to synchronize cardioversion?
it is the most useful if used promptly.
is an aed useful in effectively treatment for sudden cardiac arrest to synchronize cardioversion?
aed effectively treats cardiac arrest if due to ventricular fibrillation by giving an unsynchronized shock once the aed machine recognizes the rhythm as v-fib. a more sophisticated machine is needed for a synchronized shock to convert from rhythms such as atrial fib or flutter to normal sinus.
is there a difference between a heart attack and cardiac arrest?
cardiac arrest is when the heart actually stops. a heart attack is due to decreased blood flow to a part of the heart muscle. a heart attack can lead to cardiac arrest but not always. and there are other etiologies of cardiac arrest besides heart attack.
is there a difference between a heart attack and cardiac arrest?
in a heart attack a heart artery is blocked usually by a blood clot and causes damage to a portion of the heart. while this can be fatal most people with a heart attack survive with early recognition and treatment. cardiac arrest is actual stoppage of the heart beating which can be caused by many things and is rapidly fatal unless immediate cpr and advanced emergency techniques are applied.
is there a difference between a heart attack and cardiac arrest?
a heart attack-or "myocardial infarction"-occurs when the blood and oxygen supply to a part of the heart is interrupted due to blockage of one or more of the arteries supplying blood to the heart. this causes the part of the heart supplied by that artery to die if the blockage is not opened very quickly. cardiac arrest refers to a heart rhythm disturbance-most commonly ventricular fibrillation.
if a person lives alone and has cardiac arrest how long until the paramedics could revive them?
after 10 minutes of full cardiac arrest without cpr irreversible brain damage occurs unless immerged in ice water ( such as falling through the thin ice on a pond); sometimes the frigid temp preserves brain and heart function.
if a person lives alone and has cardiac arrest how long until the paramedics could revive them?
this depends greatly on how long it takes before somebody dials 9-1-1! living alone may greatly increase the response time since there may not be somebody to immediately notify 911. keep in mind revival from cardiac arrest varies greatly with patient condition/cause of cardiac arrest down time (how long since last heart beat) transport time to the scene and hospital and many other variables.
if a murmur is found in an unresponsive cardiac arrest 5 week old infant does that mean he still has a heart beat? my 5 week old son died on november 18th and i woke to find him not breathing or responding and he was a little pale. the emt's and the doc
i am so sorry for your tragic loss. are you sure that the doctors didn't mean that he had a murmur in the past and that he was in asystole when the you found him? if this is important for you to know i'd hope your son's pediatrician would be able to clarify the situation for you.
if a murmur is found in an unresponsive cardiac arrest 5 week old infant does that mean he still has a heart beat? my 5 week old son died on november 18th and i woke to find him not breathing or responding and he was a little pale. the emt's and the doc
i am so sorry for your loss. if the doctors or emts heard a heart murmur then he had a heart beat. while a heart murmur does not necessarily indicate that there was heart disease it is a sign of possible heart disease. there are congenital heart diseases that can have an associated heart murmur and cause critical illness in infants. also myocarditis can cause a heart murmur.
if someone had a heart attack what is the intial treatment i can offer immeditely?
aspirin then get them to a hospital asap. for cardiac arrest initiate chest compressions and call for help starting cpr. some buildings have automatic defibrillators. take a class in cpr you may save a life.
if you are in cardiac arrest is your heart motionless or quivering?
cardiac arrest just means the heart is not functioning effectively as a pump. sometimes there is chaotic electrical activity causing it to "quiver" this is ventricular fibrillation. there are other situations in which the heart is motionless perhaps without any electrical activity at all ( asystole) or with activity bit no contractions ( pulseless electrical activity).
if you are in cardiac arrest is your heart motionless or quivering?
during cardiac arrest the heart is not beating effectively to deliver blood to the tissues. it could be quivering if the heart is in ventricular fibrillation rhythmn or it could be completely still if the rhythmn is asystole. either way the person would have no pulse. a heart monitor is needed to tell the difference.
if you are in cardiac arrest is your heart motionless or quivering?
strictly speaking cardiac arrest means no electrical activity in the heart or what is called asystole. however effective pumping of the heart also ceases in ventricular fibrillation where the heart would be quivering but unable to pump blood.
if no one is around and you get a heart attack in the pool you are dead?
heart attacks cause symptoms and people seek assistance. the most common symptoms are chest pain and difficulty breathing. heart attacks should not be confused with cardiac arrest. whether this happens in a pool or in your home the chances of survival are poor. the exception is if it occurs in a hospital or other facility with resuscitation equipment and trained personnel.
is myocardial infarction more likely with premature ventricular contractions happening?
depends if pvcs are becoming more frequent. . can potentially lead to ventricular tachycardia and possibly ventricular fibrillation the latter essentially is cardiac arrest.
is it true that sudden cardiac arrest can happen to anyone anytime without warning?
it is unfortunately true.
is it true that sudden cardiac arrest can happen to anyone anytime without warning?
cardiac arrest is caused by disease of the heart either coronary artery disease or problems in the conducting system and muscle. if you don't have cardiac disease it's highly unlikely you would develop sudden cardiac arrest unless some catastrophic accident occurred such as electrical shock or trauma.
is it true that sudden cardiac arrest can happen to anyone anytime without warning?
otherwise everybody would need a cardiologist and that would not make any sense. no reason to be scared.
is it true that sudden cardiac arrest can happen to anyone anytime without warning?
it is a question of risk factors such as family history cholesterol high blood pressure smoking and diabetes. the more risk factors the higher the chance. answer is therefore no.
if someone has mi with cardiomegaly would cpr revive the person?
would do cpr if someone has a cardiac arrest and becomes unconscious with no pulse. if there is a pulse no need for chest compressions.
is it a "must" to use coolant after heart stopped and resuscitated? what if the doctors have to maintain bloodpressure and heartbeat still need it?
the latest science is that in a cardiac arrest in which resuscitation is successful but there is impaired neurological function immediately afterwards (doesn't wake up) therapeutic hypothermia (cooling) is recommended. it has been shown to dramatically reduce the chance of permanent brain and cardiac damage. however you need to discuss this with the doctor because each case is different.
is having a cardiac arrest a painful way to die?
it's more like a fainting spell without recovery.
is it possible to resuscitate someone who has had a heart attack?
the bls and acls interventions really do save many patients with cardiac arrest due to heart attacks.
i have an incomplete right bundle branch block is it dangerous nd can cause a cardiac arrest?
irbbb is usually an ecg anomaly that may speak of some right sided enlargement or strain (can occur in atrial septal defect or in pulmonary processes with right heart strain ). it can also occur innocuously and unrelated to cardiac structural changes. it does not typically imply impending conduction system collapse and is not a predictor for cardiac arrest or sudden cardiac death.
i have an incomplete right bundle branch block is it dangerous nd can cause a cardiac arrest?
by itself a rbbb is not a problem unless it is associated with structural heart disease. an echo would answer the question.
is there a link between inappropriate sinus tachycardia and sudden cardiac arrest?
likely.
is there a link between inappropriate sinus tachycardia and sudden cardiac arrest?
inappropriate sinus tachycardia is having a high heart rate unrelated to exertion. no connection.
if bp is under control you can have heart attack or cardiac arrest?
there are many noncardiac causes of cardiac arrest. bp control other risk factor modification definitely improves your health and longevity. the best way to think is shifting a curve - kind of like this image. even coronary artery disease is possible with excellent bp control cholesterol and risk modification. but it is less likely.
if bp is under control you can have heart attack or cardiac arrest?
if you have coronary artery disease smoke have high cholesterol uncontrolled diabetes and many other problems unfortunately you are still at risk for a heart attack or cardiac arrest even if your bp is under control.
is it true that sudden cardiac arrest can happen to anyone at any age?
but the likely cause varies by age.
is it true that sudden cardiac arrest can happen to anyone at any age?
there are many causes of sudden cardiac arrest. in younger individuals the cause is more likely to be a primary arrhythmia whereas in older persons it is often the result of progressive heart disease.
is xanax (alprazolam) or ativan safer for long term use? & would either of these have the possibility to cause any cardiac effects like cardiac arrest? i
not recommended for long-term use. if u r already prescribed one or the other keeping the dose therapeutic & as prescribed should not harm your cardiovascular system. i would recommend talking to your prescribing doc. about alternate medications for anxiety if u will be using long-term.
is xanax (alprazolam) or ativan safer for long term use? & would either of these have the possibility to cause any cardiac effects like cardiac arrest? i
both ativan and xanax (alprazolam) are short acting although there is available an extended release xanax (alprazolam). for the most part benzodiazapines should be used only on a short term basis due to the potential for tolerance and dependency. it can be very difficult to discontinue a benzodiazapine in a patient who has received it long term. for me it is therefore much easier to not begin one in the first place.
is xanax (alprazolam) or ativan safer for long term use? & would either of these have the possibility to cause any cardiac effects like cardiac arrest? i
any of these can cause cardiac arrest if overused. xanax (alprazolam) is shorter-acting ativan is a little longer-acting so it can build up more in your system. while none of these are safe for long-term use i would say that xanax (alprazolam) is the safer of the two.
if someone goes into cardiac arrest from extremely low potassium blood level. would the defibrillator work? or do they need the potassium
defibrillator r used in case of emergency to treat a cardiac arrest but it is important to check the reasons for the arrest and correct any lab abnormality.
if someone goes into cardiac arrest from extremely low potassium blood level. would the defibrillator work? or do they need the potassium
the defibrillator may work temporarily but if the potassium is not repleted it will stop working.
is it common for athletic children to have sudden-cardiac arrest/deaths?
but does occur with some congenital lesions marfans trauma.
is it common for athletic children to have sudden-cardiac arrest/deaths?
if the child has a cardiac problem that has not been diagnosed they are more prone to have a cardiac arrest if they participate in athletic activities. hope this makes sense!
is it possible for a person to die of cardiac arrest while running a marathon?
death from cardiac arrest during a marathon is rare. still it is important for anyone with a family history of sudden death or cardiac disease to undergo medical evaluation before strenuous activity. personal medical history age overall level of health and fitness hydration status and environmental conditions all can play a role. consult your doctor prior to any extreme fitness pursuits.
is it possible for a person to die of cardiac arrest while running a marathon?
it has happened before. some people take up the challenge to run the marathon without having a physical first and also run it without being thoroughly trained. see a dr. before and do your best to be safe. even the most elite runners have died before- hidden cardiac problem etc.
is it possible for a person to die of cardiac arrest while running a marathon?
not only is it possible this type of extreme exertion can actually increase your chances of cardiac arrest. studies have shown that marathon running causes release of troponin from the heart which is a sign of cardiac damage. marathoning also raises c reactive protein levels.
is it possible for a person to die of cardiac arrest while running a marathon?
unfortunately cardia arrest can occur in seemingly healthy athletes- events have happened everywhere including races basketball games and even patients working out in the gym. major risks for cardiac arrest include having high cholesterol smoking and having a history of cardiac disease in your family.
i'm really afraid i may get sudden cardiac arrest. what can i do to prevent that?
first get a check-up and make sure you are not at risk. at your age the risk factors are family history and having certain lipid disorders that elevate your cholesterol and triglycerides. this is why arthur ashe had a heart attack at a young age although he was physically fit.
i'm really afraid i may get sudden cardiac arrest. what can i do to prevent that?
you are 29 year old probably very healthy. you have no reason to think of a heart attack. so just live a healthy life. if you still have these jitters see a doctor for your anxiety.
i've had heart rate of 150/160bpm since july can that cause my heart damage?
when the heart rate is not restored to nl. rate it can go for complications like 1. conversion into malignant arrythmias - means ventricular ones -- cause cardiac arrest &death within seconds to minutes of onset 2. causes chf as the muscle fibres are weaked 3. blood pools inside h. chambers clots breaks goes to distant places - brain coronaries kidneys intestines. need to go to your pcp/cardiolo.
if someone is having a heart attack. would the pulse oximeter show an oxygen sat level below normal range?
it woundn't affect o2 sat unless it caused chf or cardiac arrest.
if someone had high or low potassium blood levels wouldn't an ekg show something abnormal?
potassium has a definite effect on ekg. hypokalemia can result in atrial and ventricular arrhythmias while hyperkalemia can result in bradycardia and altered cardiac conduction like peaked t waves smaller r wave a wide qrs a prolonged p-r a loss of the p wave and finally a sine wave in the most severe cases. if untreated cardiac arrest can occur so the answer is definitely yes.
i am having heart attack symptoms could it be anxiety or my acid reflux?
remember a heart attack is an occlusion of a coronary artery and doesn't mean cardiac arrest. if you develop sudden crushing chest pain not relieved with rest you may be having a heart attack. seek urgent medical attention. chest pain associated with activity could be angina and you should be checked out.
is one of the acls protocols to administer epinephrine after cardiac arrest?
epinephrine has long been part of acls.
is one of the acls protocols to administer epinephrine after cardiac arrest?
if asystole is present acls recommends a trial of epinephrine. asystole refers to an arrest where there is no electrical activity in the heart that can be detected.
is it true that coughing helps when a person is experiencing a heart attack? if yes then how is it helpful? what does coughing do to such a person?
what you refer to isn't really help when a heart attack happens but when a cardiac arrest is happening. when the heart isn't pumping the acute changes in thoracic pressure with coughing can move blood through the circulation. this is a very temporary situation and has very limited clinical data surrounding it.
is coughing useful during cardiac arrest and why?
the so called "cough cpr" is not an accepted method of cardiac resusitation.
is coughing useful during cardiac arrest and why?
there is no good data on cough really producing enough cardiac output during an arrest to justify the recommendation. the american heart association does not presently recommend this technique. it is possible it could help but no rigorous studies to prove its value.
is coughing useful during cardiac arrest and why?
cough may cause a cardiac contraction pvc and make some blood flow. but cpr and defibrillation are better in a bad situation!
is it true that coughing helps during a cardiac arrest? if yes then why and how?
the so called "cough cpr" is not an accepted method of cardiac resusitation.
is it true that coughing helps during a cardiac arrest? if yes then how and why?
been scientifically proven.
is it true that coughing helps during a cardiac arrest? if yes then how and why?
the so called "cough cpr" is not an accepted method of cardiac resusitation.
i'm just wondering if you have a cardiac pacemaker can you have a heart attack or go into cardiac arrest?
the pacemaker will keep functioning with electrical stimuli when the detected pulse is below set rate. heart attack- muscle death can happen. if it happens at site of pacer contact to heart the pacer can fail to stimulate.
i'm just wondering if you have a cardiac pacemaker can you have a heart attack or go into cardiac arrest?
pacemaker does not protect against heart attack or cardiac arrest.
is normal tachycardia fatal? which tachycardia is fatal?
heart rate but sinus tachycardia rarely goes over 150. atrial tachycardia is more serious because it can go up to 200 but it usually does not progress to cardiac arrest. ventricular tachcardia is more serious because it can progress to cardiac arrest in a few seconds.
when is an implantable cardioverter defibrillator used to treat patients with arrhythmias?
when the risk for cardiac arrest is high enough a physician may recommend a patient get an icd. this might be for patients with a weak heart genetic disease (like hocm long qt arvd) or someone who has survived a cardiac arrest already.
what benefit does the implantable cardioverter-defibrillator give to patients who have had a cardiac arrest or heart attack?
implantable cardioverter-defibrillators (icds) are used to treat ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation which if untreated may cause a fatal cardiac arrest. icds can often quickly treat these conditions before permanent brain or heart damage can be done. icds are not used to treat or prevent heart attacks which are a "plumbing" issue.
what benefit does the implantable cardioverter-defibrillator give to patients who have had a cardiac arrest or heart attack?
depending on the reason for cardiac arrest an automatic implantable defibrillator can be very effective in preventing a second cardiac arrest in the future.
why is ventricular fibrillation the most common rhythm of cardiac arrest?
ventricular fibrillation is the final step before a heart stops beating. any heart that has not gotten enough blood flow or oxygen for a prolonged period of time will begin fibrillating followed shortly by asystole (no beating at all). in a sense ventricular fibrillation is the final step every heart likely goes through before it stops beating.
why is ventricular fibrillation the most common rhythm of cardiac arrest?
basically we are talking about cardiac arrest. this means the heart ceases to pump. the two options are asystole or no heart beats or ventricular fibrillation. rapid chaotic ineffective quivering of the heart. vf is a common consequence of heart attacks. it is also a common consequence of enlarged weakened heart (cardiomyopathy). two common causes of death.
what are the benefits of having a pacemaker?
preventing problems from very low heart beat such as heart failure passing out and in extreme cases cardiac arrest. also symptoms such as fatigue and shortness of breath from low heart beat may improve. sometimes it is used when medications treating fast heart beats also causes very slow heart beat. a special resynchronization pacemaker with three leads may be used to treat heart failure.
will calorie restriction causes cardiac arrest?
no unless you are undernourished or malnourished.
will calorie restriction causes cardiac arrest?
by extremely reducing calories without taking into account the number of calories one needs the electrolytes (sodium and potassium) and basic sugars and proteins in order to just maintain baseline function you are risking a severe imbalance and can cause a fatal cardiac arrhythmia (cardiac arrest). severe calorie restriction should be monitored by a physician familiar with nutrition.
i bought a cardiac defibrillator i keep at my house incase of emergencies. would this increase chances of survival of cardiac arrest if used with cpr?
but need to keep it serviced and effective. need to have practice sessions with users! unlikely to need but useful in a code!
i bought a cardiac defibrillator i keep at my house incase of emergencies. would this increase chances of survival of cardiac arrest if used with cpr?
i did not even know they just sell defibrillators just like that. first if it is for yourself you'll never use it as indicated. you have to be in sudden death first to use it so you'll never use it. remotely it will not happen to you either. if for someone else you'll go to jail for using it not knowing if it is being used in the indicated manner. donate it lock it or throw it away.
i don't feel right. like i'm about to die or have a cardiac arrest is it possible to know that or is this anxiety?
lots of possibilities but you need to see a good psychologist. you may be having panic attacks which properly trained psychologists can successfully treat in a few sessions 90% of the time. you're taking celexa (citalopram) which suggests you may be depressed. in any case get thee to a good psychologist. don't suffer for nothing.
i don't feel right. like i'm about to die or have a cardiac arrest is it possible to know that or is this anxiety?
it is hard to be so complacent. the best way is to present to you doctor when you are having the problem and he/she can do at least an ekg and interview you better. reassurance always have to have a basis and the basis is when the right things have been done only then you can sit down with the doctor be reassured so it happens again you know what to do.
is it possible beta blockers could drop heart rate too low and cause cardiac arrest? what would be a concerning heart rate?
it is definitely possible for beta blockers to cause the heart rate to drop too low (called bradycardia) but cardiac arrest would be extremely unusual. a low heart rate becomes concerning when someone is having symptoms (such as sweating dizziness nausea etc. ) and if it doesn't increase with activity. some elite athletes have resting heart rates below 40 bpm.
is it possible beta blockers could drop heart rate too low and cause cardiac arrest? what would be a concerning heart rate?
athletes may run about 40 and be comfortable most of us are not in that shape. under 60 deserves evaluation or discussion or medication adjustment.
what causes sudden cardiac arrest in a young and previously healthy person?
if heart is not working well and if suddenly there is a high demand this can cause an arrest.
what causes sudden cardiac arrest in a young and previously healthy person?
undiagnosed structural heart problems can (very rarely) lead to a cardiac arrest in what appears to be an otherwise healthy person. certain illegal drugs particularly stimulants such as cocaine also have the potential to cause rhythm problems that can lead to cardiac arrest.
what are the chances of survival after a small heart attack that causes a cardiac arrest?
it is the cardiac arrest not the heart attack that is concerning. the faster a patient receives medical attention during a cardiac arrest and the faster a normal heart rhythm is restored the more likely the patient will do well.
what are the chances of survival after a small heart attack that causes a cardiac arrest?
the issue in the case you are describing is not the "small" heart attack but the cardiac arrest which is likely caused by a rhythm disturbance in the heart. the chances that someone survives a cardiac arrest are directly related to how quickly defibrillation (i. e. shock from an aed) occurs. this period of time can be extended by high quality cpr- if cpr is performed well defib can occur later.
what are the chances of survival after a small heart attack that causes a cardiac arrest?
if it was a "small" heart attack it should not cause cardiac arrest. people do survive minor heart attacks.
what causes athletes to have sudden heart attacks/cardiac arrest?
sudden cardiac arrest is usually due to conduction disease or hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. pete maravich died of coronary artery disease during a pick up game. it turns out he only had 1 coronary artery. it is the main reason athletes at all levels have preliminary cardiac clearence.
what causes athletes to have sudden heart attacks/cardiac arrest?
most commonly if this were to happen an athlete would have an underlying heart condition. what you may be referring to is that long-term athletes can have enlargement of the heart musculature due to increased needs of the body. this could potentially lead to abnormal heart rhythms.
what is the difference between ventricular and supraventricular arrhythmia?
although supraventricular arrhythmias (rhythm disturbances that originate in the atria) may lead to serious health problems over time they are rarely an immediate life threat. in contrast ventricular arrhythmias are truly life threatening and if not rapidly treated can lead to cardiac arrest and death. automatic external defibrillators (aed's) were developed to treat ventricular arrythmias.
what's the first thing to do if you see someone go into cardiac arrest?
during cardiac arrest the heart is no longer able to effectively pump blood to the rest of the body. as a result the brain does not receive enough oxygen which causes the patient to "pass out" and become unresponsive.
what's the first thing to do if you see someone go into cardiac arrest?
and start performing cpr after checking their pulse.
what kind of ventricular fibrillation is not dangerous?
ventricular fibrillation is a condition in which there is uncoordinated contraction of the cardiac muscle of the ventricles in the heart making them quiver rather than contract properly. ventricular fibrillation is a medical emergency and a commonly identified arrythmia in cardiac arrest patients. ventricular fibrillation is a medical emergency that requires prompt emergency intervention.
i feel bloated breathless dizzy confused and nauseous. i just ate a lot but was fatigued before eating. i fear cardiac arrest. er?
you may have post prandial hypotension where eating can lower your blood pressure and make you dizzy confused and nauseous.
i feel bloated breathless dizzy confused and nauseous. i just ate a lot but was fatigued before eating. i fear cardiac arrest. er?
at your age unless you have a heart condition you should be at very low risk of cardiac arrest. some things that can increase your risk include nutritional imbalances from an eating disorder and being exposed to drugs that affect your heart like cocaine. if you have some exposure to these or other unusual circumstances then you should seek emergency care.
i feel bloated breathless dizzy confused and nauseous. i just ate a lot but was fatigued before eating. i fear cardiac arrest. er?
when you are bloated gas goes up to your esophagus and could be breathed in and cause your feeling of sob. the fear causes hyperventilation dizziness faintish feeling and some numbness of face fingers and feet. the nausea is simply from the belatedness. drink some fluid if can have some antacid and relax. your risks at 18 is low.
what types of defibrillators are there?
implantable (internal) defibrillators remain in the body whereas external defibrillators are the boxes with paddles that you see on tv shows. they both shock the heart out of life-threatening cardiac arrest rhythm if need be. there are automated external units that lay people can use; you put paddles on person's chest and the machine determines the rhythm and speaks commands to give a shock.
where can someone find a defibrillator?
an external defibrillator can be found in many public places thanks to recent studies showing that availability of these automated devices can be used by even untrained bystanders to save lives during a cardiac arrest. airports usually have them displayed on a wall as do many theaters concert halls etc. restaurants may have one as well but you probably have to ask someone to go get it.
what are the possible outcomes for myocardial infarction?
most people recover with little complications. some suffer cardiac arrest and die suddenly. a small group have major myocardial infarctions resulting in substantial and disablling damage to the heart. shortness of breath and loss of energy can occur. recurrent myocardial infarctions are not uncommon in those who continue to have high risk factors that are not addressed.
what is worse: ventricular fibrillation or atrial fibrillation?
vf is worse; it usually causes cardiac arrest which is often fatal. atrial fibrillation while not as severe also has significant health risks. it increases the risk of stroke which can be disabling or fatal. additionally if the af causes a fast pulse for a prolonged period of time this may lead to weakening of the heart and cause heart failure.
will narcan (naloxone) reverse an opiate overdose once cardiac arrest has occurred?
narcan (naloxone) can reverse a narcotic overdose to a point. if someone takes a narcotic overdose and it is enough to stop breathing the lack of oxygen and rise in carbon dioxide can cause the heart to stop ( cardiac arrest) at that point simply reversing the effect of the narcotic that started the process is not enough one take additional measures to restore a pulse and resuscitate the patient.
will narcan (naloxone) reverse an opiate overdose once cardiac arrest has occurred?
it depends entirely on the method of delivery and the interval circulation during the arrest. the medication will certainly do its pharmacologic action as long as circulation is restored to some extent. the onset of action may be delayed but the drug efficacy should be unaffected once administered. as with all drugs administered during an arrest their efficacy is diminished to some extent.
is it possible to have cardiac arrest & lived?
during a cardiac arrest the heart stops contracting so that there is no blood being circulated to the organs. cardiopulmonary resuscitation is performed to restore contractility. if successful the person survives. the longer it takes to "re-start" the heart the more likely there will be residual effects like brain injury due to decreased oxygen to the brain during the arrest.
is it possible that im administration of narcan (naloxone) in a cardiac arrest victim be helpful?
narcan (naloxone) reverses the effects of a narcotic overdose. so if the cardiac arrest is thought to be due to a narcotic overdose then narcan (naloxone) can be tried. whether or not it will be effective depends on many factors including how long the person has been without a heartbeat whether cpr has been done etc. if the brain has been without oxygen for too long narcan (naloxone) will not reverse this brain injury.
when should i be concerned of rapid heart rate? experiencing rapid heart rate for several months
the medical term for a rapid heart rhythm is tachycardia. there are many different types of tachycardias and their clinical importance depends on several key factors with heart rate being only one of those. other important variable include the type of tachycardia patientâ€™s age other associated health problems etc. for example while two people may have the same â€˜heart rateâ€™ (say 175 â€˜beats per minutesâ€™ or bpm) the prognosis is very different in a young health person who reaches that rate only while running a marathon on a hot day (sinus tachycardia or normal fast heart rhythm) than in a heart attack survivor with a history of heart failure who has just been resuscitated from an out of hospital cardiac arrest secondary to ventricular tachycardia (a life threatening from the bottom chambers of the heart). other common tachycardias include atrial fibrillation and paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia (psvt). while both of these tachycardias involve the upper chambers of the heart only atrial fibrillation is associated with an increased risk of strokes. in most patients with atrial fibrillation their stroke risk can be decreased with the use of blood thinners such as warfarin. among patients with tachycardias symptoms can range from nothing to palpitations shortness of breath and passing out to death. while most abnormal heart rhythms can be diagnosed and treated by well-trained primary care physicians cardiac electrophysiologists (cardiologists specialized in rhythm disturbances) are the experts in this area.
will bradycardia kill me if i don't get treatment?
some forms of bradycardia are almost equivalent to a cardiac arrest and need tone treated emergently. talk to your doctor he will give you a better idea of what to expect in your case.
what are the most common symptoms of cardiac arrhythmia?
palpitations are the most common but fainting and even a cardiac arrest can occur from some of the more serious arrhythmias.
what symptoms of cardiac arrest are the most common?
there may be several symptoms that precede cardiac arrest. these include chest pain palpitations fainting or near fainting spells or shortness of breath. unfortunately many patients suffer cardiac arrest without any warning symptoms.
what symptoms of cardiac arrest are the most common?
cardiac arrest means complete cessation of heart function. this leads to complete stop of blood circulation and death if not rescued immediately. basic life support (chest compressions) and proper use of defibrillator is key to survival while more sophisticated help awaited.
will someone live forever if he has a internal defibrillator now?
icds may help prevent cardiac arrest but do not prevent the heart from failing due to heart attack or progressive muscle weakening. other non-heart conditions can still be fatal even with an icd.
when would a defibrillator be used in a school?
unfortunately students are not immune from cardiac arrest. student athletes occassionally have cardiac arrest and having an aed available can be life saving.
what would doctors do if someone went into cardiac arrest during heart operation?
it's standard operating procedure in many heart operations for the surgeon to stop or arrest the heart and put the patient temporarily on a heart-lung machine. in fact if one should suffer an unexpected cardiac arrest the heart operating room is the very best place in the world for it to happen (since the resuscitation statistics there are stellar. ).
what would doctors do if someone went into cardiac arrest during heart operation?
they would do their best to revive the heart and bring it back using cpr or even shocking.
what would doctors do if someone went into cardiac arrest during heart operation?
if a patient suffers cardiac arrest cardiac protocols are followed. treatment includes possibly cpr shocking the heart depending on the rhythm present and giving medications. if the arrest occurs during open heart surgery the heart can be manually pumped and directly shocked. acls advanced cardiac life support protocols are followed. doctors are specifically trained to handle this emergency.
what happens if you have a heart attack on an airplane?
a real heart attack is a medical emergency. they will land the plane at the nearest airport. if you have a cardiac arrest during a flight you will likely not get any airmiles.
what known risk factors predispose a person to sudden cardiac arrest?
the most common cause is disease of the coronary arteries but problems in the electrical conducting system can also be a cause. cardiomyopathies of many different causes are associated with sudden cardiac arrest. many of these people have implanted defibrillators to reduce this risk.
what known risk factors predispose a person to sudden cardiac arrest?
smoking history family history of heart disease high cholesterol high blood pressure.
what is the difference between cardiac arrest and mi?
myocardial infarction (mi) occurs when there is an obstruction of a blood vessel that supplies part of the heart and this leads to damage to the heart muscle. mi might lead to death and can cause cardiac arrest if not treated but not always. cardiac arrest means that the heart is no longer pumping blood can be caused by a variety of things and always leads to death if not treated promptly.
what is the difference between cardiac arrest and mi?
mi is when the heart muscle is not getting the blood supply it needs. the part of the heart not receiving enough blood is at risk to die. cardiac arrest is when the heart stops beating entirely. one of the causes of cardiac arrest is mi or myocardial infarction. both are life-threatening and require an immediate 911 call.
what is the difference between cardiac arrest and mi?
cardiac arrest is when the heart stops if not immediately reversed it's death. myocardial infarction is when the blood supply to part of the heart is interrupted leading to serious damage to the heart. the damage can be so severe that it leads to cardiac arrest.
what would be the thing to do if a child has sudden cardiac arrest while playing a sport on the field?
if anyone including a child has a sudden cardiac arrest 911 should be immediately called and cpr initiated. the 911 operators can talk you through it if you are untrained. an automatic external defibrillator or aed should be applied according to the directions if one is available. this device will deliver a "shock" to the heart if warranted. this can all be life-saving.
what would be the thing to do if a child has sudden cardiac arrest while playing a sport on the field?
start cpr immediately after calling 911. if a aed is available hook it up and follow the directions. learn cpr and take refresher courses to keep up to date.
what would be the thing to do if a child has sudden cardiac arrest while playing a sport on the field?
put in play your abc's (airway breathing and circulation) as fast as possible. if you determine that the child has a clear airway is not breathing and has no pulse initiate cpr right away and instruct one specific individual to call 911 (don't just say "someone call"). should there be a defibrillator available delegate the use of the device to someone who knows how to use it at once.
is there any risk for a patient (ef = 39%)(angioplasty stenting cardiac arrest 5 weeks back) to travel by train 2500km to reach best cardiac hospital
unless there is ongoing chest pain.
is there any risk for a patient (ef = 39%)(angioplasty stenting cardiac arrest 5 weeks back) to travel by train 2500km to reach best cardiac hospital
a few risks come to mind with your condition and a trip of this nature. first if the train climbs to high altitudes you might be more prone to experience problems due to diminished cardiac function. second the risk of communicable disease is higher with numbers of people in closed quarters. third the train might wreck. overall i'd say the benefits probably outweigh the risk.
what is the chance of me having a sudden cardiac arrest is aortic stenosis?
severity of aortic stenosis impacts risk of cardiac arrest. also coronary artery disease is also associated with aortic stenosis thus also increasing the risk of cardiac arrest. however for mild to moderate aortic stenosis the risk is ameliorated.
what is the chance of me having a sudden cardiac arrest is aortic stenosis?
it will all depend on the severity of your stenosis. mild and even moderate degrees of severity do not necessarily place you at a significantly higher risk but severe degrees may particularly with vigorous exertion. you do need to check with your cardiologist who will probably want to perform an echocardiogram after exercise. it is important you know there are treatments available if necessary.
will narcan (naloxone) still reverse opiate overdose once cardiac arrest has occurred?
usually breathing stops with opiate overdose and then cardiac arrest occurs. reversing with narcan (naloxone) may allow breathing to restart but the cardiac arrest would still have to be treated with cpr and usual measures. depending on the duration of cardiac arrest attempts may or may not be successful thus the uncertainty.
will narcan (naloxone) still reverse opiate overdose once cardiac arrest has occurred?
if the narcan (naloxone) can reach the circulation it will work. cpr can provide a reduced blood flow that is adequate to reverse the opiate. injecting the narcan (naloxone) into the central circulation (jugular or subclavian vein) will further improve its efficacy.
what's difference between cardiac arrest and asystole?
cardiac arrest refers to any situation in which the heart is not pumping blood. this may occur with abnormal electrical activity in the heart in which the heart is quivering ( ventricular fibrillation) or beating so fast in can not pump blood effectively (ventricular tachycardia ) asystole is a kind of cardiac arrest in which the heart is electrically silent ( flat line) on ekg.
what's difference between cardiac arrest and asystole?
asystole means there is no electrical activity in the heart and this results in cardiac arrest. there are also other cardiac rhythmns that result in cardiac arrest. asystole is one of them.
what's difference between cardiac arrest and asystole?
asystole is one form of cardiac arrest (sudden cardiac death) but others include dangerous ventricular arrhythmias such as ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation.
what part of heart does "long qt syndrome" affect?
long qt is a genetic syndrome that causes abnormal behavior of the ion channels in the cardiac muscle which alters the electrical behavior of the heart. this can make people prone to dangerous arrhythmias which may progress to cardiac arrest.
if the pacemaker can not prevent the heart attack what happens to it during the heart attack?
a heart attack usually doesn't affect an electronic pacemaker. the device will help prevent the heart from slowing excessively and usually won't be affected by rapid heart action. if a cardiac arrest occurs and defibrillation is necessary the electric shock could possibly affect the pacer circuitry.
what are the primary indicators for implantable defibrillator?
the primary indications for an aicd are a left ventricular ejection fraction (lvef) of 6 weeks after heart attack lvef 1 year patients in whom medical therapy doesn't suppress vt/vf or cardiac arrest or sustained vt with defibrillation.
what are the primary indicators for implantable defibrillator?
when the risk for cardiac arrest is high enough a physician may recommend a patient get an icd. this might be for patients with a weak heart genetic disease (like hocm long qt arvd) or someone who has survived a cardiac arrest already.
will narcan (naloxone) reverse opiate overdose after cardiac arrest has occurred?
narcan (naloxone) will reverse respiratory arrest. this means that if a person has stopped breathing due to an overdose of oxycontin or heroin for example narcan (naloxone) can bring back the drive to breathe. if the person doesn't breathe for a long time though the heart will stop which is called cardiac arrest due to lack of oxygen. narcan (naloxone) won't fix that. this is why narcotic abuse is so dangerous.
will narcan (naloxone) reverse opiate overdose after cardiac arrest has occurred?
once cardiac arrest has occurred there is no circulation to carry medications especially if cpr is not being done. furthermore narcan (naloxone) will do nothing to reverse an arrest.
will narcan (naloxone) reverse opiate overdose after cardiac arrest has occurred?
narcan (naloxone) will reverse the opiate effect if it is circulated by chest compressions; however if you have a cardiac arrest from an opiate overdose it is likely that you've already suffered a significant brain injury and you may not survive the arrest.
i was wondering what would cause a cardiac arrest after a sinus arrest?
sinus arrest is a cardiac arrest initially affecting the atria. usually an idioventricular escape rythm follows but when it doesn't then total asysyole occurs resulting in sudden death. acute hyperkalemia of enough severity could cause total asystole. sinus arrest can be triggered by vagal stimulation.
i swear i felt my heart stop before i passed out. i'm quite familiar with rapid heart rhythm but not with such a cardiac arrest? what is that?
patients who have episodes of syncope should have an evaluation by a cardiologist. tests that are usually performed in addition to blood testing include an echocardiogram and a holter monitor test.
what is the chance of someone surviging a? sudden cardiac arrest?
survival depends on time to reversal of the arrest; patients in the real world who are appropriately defibrillated within 2 minutes have a 70% survival rate (this is population wide not specific to any one individual). if the arrest happens in the hospital and is due to a medical or surgical issue survival is actually lower (as the arrest is part of the dying process from the other illness).
what is the chance of someone surviging a? sudden cardiac arrest?
with ent resuscitation & transfer to cicu fair.
i have gerd. i feel some quick spasms/pressure in chest that change my pulse. i'm checking it in the neck and i noticed that it jumps the beat.
not cause of cardiac arrhythmia. some variation in heart rate with respirations is normal but if you have many skipped beats you should have a doctor listen to your heart. most often cardiac arrhythmia is not serious but rarely it can lead to cardiac arrest. have your doctor take a look and listen.
what causes the cardiac arrest in a bulimic patient?
the more common causes are low potassium or alkaline blood. malnutrition can lead to a dilated heart which can also lead to death.
what is the difference between having asystole and having a cardiac arrest?
asystole or a heart with no electrical activity is how we all end up at death. a cardiac arrest can start there but usually starts with a rapid rhythm that has low or no output or a noncontractile rhythm (ventricular fibrillation). these rhythms are often reversible asystole is usually simply death.
what is the difference between having asystole and having a cardiac arrest?
is a calf a cow? if you are making veal parm? cardiac arrest is the loss of pumping ability of the heart. that is measured as cardiac output (units l/min). in cardiac arrest it is 0. asystole is usually used to refer to the lack of electrical activity in the heart. if the electrical system could be measured it would be measured in amps (current or electrons /sec). in asystole that is 0.
what is the difference between atrial fibrillation and ventricular fibrillation?
ventricular fibrillation is from the bottom chamber; vf is worse; it usually causes cardiac arrest which is often fatal. atrial fibrillation - from the top chamber- while not as severe also has significant health risks. it increases the risk of stroke which can be disabling or fatal.
is there a connection between cardiac arrest and brain damage?
cardiac arrest leads to lack of blood flow to the brain and after just a few minutes there is usually irreversible damage
is there a connection between cardiac arrest and brain damage?
when the heart stops (cardiac arrest) blood and oxygen are no longer provided to the organs in the body. the brain is one of the most sensitive organs in such a situation and can have permanent damage if cpr is not started (or spontaneous cardiac function does not occur) in as little as 5 minutes when the body is at normal temperature. anoxic brain injury can occur when other organs are unharmed
in an older person in their 80's what would be the most common cause of sudden cardiac arrest?
coronary artery disease is the most frequent cause of sudden death over the age of 60. unfortunately some of these have no symptoms prior to their cardiac arrest
if a young fit and healthy person was exercising so hard their heart rate got up to 220 bmp what would happen? would they enter cardiac arrest?
as your age is 22 after reaching 198 you are predisposed to cardiac arrythmias instead of normal heart beat abnormal unhealthy heart contractions appear which can potentially make the heart to go to arrest. again heart does not follow rules. it happen at lower rates too and dont happen eve at higher rates. but its not recommended to go beyond 200-age.
is it possible for iv saline to cause fluid overload in cardiac arrest patients?
fluid from any source can cause fluid overload.
if they are concerned that may go into cardiac arrest due to my ekg and heart palpitations why could it be that they sent me home?
given your age and that you were evaluated and sent home i feel like you must have misunderstood their concern. i agree. i do not think they would have sent you home if there were concerns for heart attack or cardiac arrest. if you are really worried i would call the facility where you were evaluated and ask for clarification.
what's the youngest age is it possible to go into cardiac arrest from an overdose?
overdoses of large variety of drugs can end in cardiac arrest - there's no lower limit at what age this can happen.
what's the youngest age is it possible to go into cardiac arrest from an overdose?
you can die from an overdose at any age and with enough cocaine or methamphetamine anyone can have a myocardial infarction.
what do you do if a co-worker suffers from cardiac arrest at work?
call 911 then use cpr and (if you have one) place the pads for the office aed on him/her and follow directions. dont stop until relieved by ems.
what do you do if a co-worker suffers from cardiac arrest at work?
if a person collapses check for their pulse and if absent call 911 and perform cpr; basically perform chest compression at a rate of 100 per minute pushing with both hands interlocked on the breastbone trying to 'push it in' about an inch. don't stop until paramedics arrive.
would they defib or pump ur heart if it stops in a gym?
if a gym member suffers a cardiac arrest the best chance of survival is if they shock the heart with a defibrillator (aed). if an aed is not available or while waiting for the aed to arrive and be set up then chest compressions should be performed.
i keep coughing and i have a severe head cold with an avg. resting heart rate of 110. i am scared about cardiac arrest should i go back to a doc?
young people can generally tolerate hr elevations like this for many days especially if they are associated with medications like cough medicine or decongestants.
what does a medical staff do for a person in cardiac arrest?
there are only a handful of treatments. shocking (defibrillation) if the patient has an abnormal electrical rhythm that may be able to be reset. defibrillation is like hitting the reset button on the heart airway management (either with a bag valve mask or endotracheal tube). there are lots of meds that can be used but most are ineffective. if its traumatic there are other procedures to consider.
what does a medical staff do for a person in cardiac arrest?
they call nit a different name by a code in different hospital code blue is normally used in us for cardiac arrest the whole tream is there and try to ressuscitate the patient.
what is the difference between a heart seizure and a heart attack?
heart attack and heart seizure are general laymen terms. heart attack refer to the injury of heart muscle due to blockage of one of the vessels in the heart - ischemia. heart seizure refer to the heart arrhythmia - irregular heart beat which sometimes can lead to cardiac arrest ( like ventricular fibrillation ).
what can you do for a loved one if they go into cardiac arrest?
get yourself trained in cpr so you can administer it if that situation occurs and call 911 immediately.
what can you do for a loved one if they go into cardiac arrest?
get help call 911 then start chest compressions and manual ventilation (cpr). continue until they respond or help arrives.
what can a monitor do to help detect respiratory and cardiac arrest in a preemie?
it literally detects the stopping of respirations or heartbeat. i assume you mean the monitor in the hospital. if you are talking about the house video cams then nothing.
what can a monitor do to help detect respiratory and cardiac arrest in a preemie?
the presence of a normal breathing wave & frequency along with a normal heart rate & wave gives a visual conformation of the premi's stable state. if the breathing rate begins to slow & the pulse rate slow also you can tell from across the room that something bad may be starting. this allows the staff to start checking for equipment faults or other issues & helps them begin resuscitation early
what are the chances of cardiac arrest (ventricular fibrillation) occuring twice?
very likely especially if the first one was not treated. somewhat less likely if the first one was treated and predisposing factors were identified and eliminated but still possible e. g. unidentified additional predisposing factors or just heart tissue being more sensitive.
what can cause a cardiac arrest in a bulimic?
bulimia lends itself to upsetting the normal chemistry in the blood which is needed to normal functioning of the heart. not allowing the body to absorb nutrients prevents having the needed sodium and potassium levels. when this balance is off the heart may go into a toxic rhythm leading to death.
what's the difference between vfib and afib?
ventricular fibrillation is from the bottom chamber; vf is worse; it usually causes cardiac arrest which is often fatal. atrial fibrillation - from the top chamber- while not as severe also has significant health risks. it increases the risk of stroke which can be disabling or fatal.
what can cause soccer players to go into cardiac arrest?
the most common reasons would be hypertrophic cardiomyopathy long qt syndrome and several other genetic defects. the cause is usually a lethal arrhythmia such as ventricular tachycardia or fibrillation. a pre-participation physical will not always find these problems unless a family history suggests looking specifically for them.
what is the difference between cardiac arrest and cardiorespiratory arrest?
cardiac arrest means the heart has stopped beating whereas cardiopulmonary arrest means the heart has stopped beating and the person is not breathing. the latter is more specific but if the heart has stopped the person will not be breathing. it is possible to have a respiratory arrest and the heart is still beating but if the heart stops breathing stops too.
what are some signs and symptoms of cardiac arrest?
in cardiac arrest the heart stops beating. so the person will be unconscious unarousable and have no pulse and not be breathing. the person is clinically dead and cpr needs to be performed immediately and an aed used if available. call 911 immediately and they will instruct you on what to do before professional help arrives.
what long term effect does a cardiac arrest have on your heart?
on degree of damage or not. if with heart attack and dead muscle it can be severe. if a chemical issue and no damage the heart may be fine.
what long term effect does a cardiac arrest have on your heart?
the long-term effect of cardiac arrest on your heart depends on the reason for the initial arrest and on the quality of the cardiopulmonary resuscitation (cpr). for instance cpr may not contribute to any long-term heart damage if it is initiated quickly and performed effectively particularly if the etiology of the cardiac arrest is from a non-cardiac cause.
what are the signs of sudden cardiac arrest?
loss of consciousness not breathing erratic (or no) pulse paleness.
what are the signs of sudden cardiac arrest?
no circulation no pulse drop to ground and dies. call 911 and begin cpr! and you can save a percentage of such folks!
what type of medical treatment is given to a sudden cardiac arrest patient?
cpr intubation? possible defibrillation stabilize rhythym anti arrythmic medications. may need diagnostic cath and studies for infarction or other damage as cause of issue.
what type of medical treatment is given to a sudden cardiac arrest patient?
bystander cpr is first and 911 should be called. advanced cardiac life support is used to insure initial survival. after stabilization the cause of the arrest should be determined and treated.
what is the difference between amiodarone vs. lidocaine in cardiac arrest?
lidocaine is no longer listed in acls protocols because of reduced efficacy and potential for toxicity. amiodarone is the preferred drug.
what is the difference between amiodarone vs. lidocaine in cardiac arrest?
be more specific if you would. both drugs are used effectively for the arrhythmias that occur during an arrest. but their mechanisms of action effects on heart performance time to onset of "action " and appropriateness as a first line of defense differ widely. if an individual has an implantable defibrillator device in place this would also affect the decision to use one or the other.
what would happen to a patient who has cardiac arrest while undergoing chemotherapy?
cardiac arrest is never a good thing. what happens following depends on several things. what was the cause? how fast was the heart restarted and was cpr good? what is their overall health like? any residual effects from the arrest? these answers to these questions and more can help predict the outcome.
what happens if the doctor defibs someone not in cardiac arrest?
i saw a doctor accidentally get shocked during a code. he didn't take his hand off the bed. he collapsed suddenly but recovered in a couple of seconds. defibrillation works by stopping all electrical activity in the heart. this allows the heart to reset. we depend on the natural tendency of the heart to beat to restart it. that's why if there is no rhythm at all we don't shock- we do cpr and meds.
what happens if the doctor defibs someone not in cardiac arrest?
if ventricular tachycardia atrial flutter or atrial fibrillation they will be cardioverted possibly. if person was in normal rhythym they will have had a shock and muscles will be sore!
why is it that a cardiomyopathy arrythmia causes immediate unconsciousness / death?
cardiomyopathy implies that the heart is already sick and so any further stress on it such as an arrhythmia can push it over the edge and either reduce the output causing unconsciousness or can lead to cardiac arrest.
what can i do to prevent a sudden cardiac arrest?
see a cardiologist. particularly if there is a strong family history. sudden cardiac death can result from a number of conditions.
what are causes of cardiac arrest?
clogged arteries to the heart pulmonary embolus electrolye abn congenital heart disease drug s both legal and illegal etc.
what are common heart attack symptoms?
remember a heart attack is an occlusion of a coronary artery and doesn't mean cardiac arrest. if you develop sudden crushing chest pain not relieved with rest you may be having a heart attack. seek urgent medical attention. common symptoms are crushing chest pain sweating difficulty breathing nausea.
if you have a pacemaker can you still have a heart attack / cardiac arrest?
pacemaker helps to control or regulate the rhythm (electricity) of the heart. heart attack is related to blockages of the arteries of the heart (plumbing if you want the analogy). pacemaker will prevent the heart beating too slow but will not prevent blockages from developing or producing heart attacks
why atropine is no longer recommended for the treatment of cardiac arrest in adults?
studies have shown that during cardiac arrest epinephrine works just as well without the routine use of atropine. atropine should be used when cardiac arrest is secondary to a bradycardic arrest.
why atropine is no longer recommended for the treatment of cardiac arrest in adults?
the current protocols for acls have better results. atropine still has some effectiveness in specific situations.
why atropine is no longer recommended for the treatment of cardiac arrest in adults?
atropine is used in treating low heart rates. it is usually not helpful in cardiac arrest unless the shocked rhythm returns as a bradycardia with loe blood pressure.
what determines whether or not someone responds to the cooling protocol used after a cardiac arrest?
cooling protocol is a routine procedure after cardiac arrest. you try to slow all metabolism and see the rest leads to recovery. if the patient wakes up and responds appropriately that is a good sign.
what determines whether or not someone responds to the cooling protocol used after a cardiac arrest?
how long the brain has been deprived of blood flow carrying oxygen is critical to the recovery. if the amount of time is not too long the brain can recover with the help of cooling. however if too much time without oxygen has occurred the cooling won't make any difference.
what cause cardiac arrest during c sections?
bleeding clot embolism anesthesia or drug toxicity or interaction pre-existing heart or lung disease. specific: amniotic or air embolism eclampsia and hypertension there are more but this is a sample.
what cause cardiac arrest during c sections?
it could be many things including electrolyte abnormality effects of anesthesia or cardiac problems.
i am always having the intense fear and anxiety about carcinophobia. can this anxiety lead to a sudden cardiac arrest?
it is very unlikely that only anxiety would lead to a heart attack. anxiety can increase blood pressure heart rate and breathing but in over 15 years of practice i have never met or heard of someone who died from a panic attack. if anxiety is interfering in daily functioning consider professional help. one strategy: identify what you can control and focus on an action plan & practice relaxing.
i am always having the intense fear and anxiety about carcinophobia. can this anxiety lead to a sudden cardiac arrest?
extreme degree of stress can cause arrhythmias chf and cardiac arrest.
is it possible for a completely healthy young fall victim of a sudden cardiac arrest without any reason?
yes. likely due to an undiagnosed pre-existing cardiac condition.
is it possible for a completely healthy young fall victim of a sudden cardiac arrest without any reason?
it is possible but rare. there are cases of young healthy athletes arresting while playing sports. this is usually thought to be caused by abnormal electrical conduction system of the heart
what confirms myocardial infarction?
acute cardiogenic shock . ventricular arrythmias infarct syndrome flash pulmonary edema wall motion abnormalities syncope presyncope cardiac arrest . it takes 4 hours for troponins to elevate after the infarct begins. that is why clinical symptoms dictate emergent coronary interventions. troponins may still be normal within minutes of a life threatening myocardial infarct.
what is the definition or description of: cardiac arrest?
most cardiac arrest episodes are due to the heart rhythm becoming inadequate to pump blood to the body. ventricular fibrillation is commonly the abnormal rhythm associated with cardiac arrest. if effective rhythm isn't restored the patient dies.
what is the definition or description of: cardiac arrest?
cardiac standstill=death asystole ventricular fibrillation =wiggling but not pumping ventricular tachycardia= a little ineffective pumping may occur in the field the person is pulse less and an ekg will help differentiate.
in response to reply regarding sudden cardiac arrest there are lots of stories of people my age dying is a ech holster and bloods enough to rule out?
family history and risk factor analysis along with stress echo are probably your best bet if worried. be aware. some young cardiac arrest victims do have congenital or inherited problems but others die due to ill advised use of inhalants and substances like cocaine which can cause arterial spasm and heart attack. know the risks!
i had contrast ct 2 hours ago. i'm terrified i will get a delayed adverse reaction and cardiac arrest from it. could i? feel flush and dizzy
by 2hr post ct you are well past the time when you are likely to have an adverse reaction try and relax
i've been waking up with a rapid heart beat recently. i have anxiety so is it related to that or a physical condition?
abnormalities need to be excluded before you can ascribe rapid heart beat to anxiety alone. you will need to have ekg monitoring during these attacks which usually requires 24 hour ambulatory monitoring. certain electrical conduction abnormalities could predispose you to cardiac arrest so you need to see a doctor for accurate diagnosis.
iv had ecg holter monitor i suffer aniexty and panic attacks chances of sudden cardiac arrest due to palpatations?
its always easy to blame signs and symptoms on anxiety. if a holter is the only work up thus far an echo to assess your heart function and structure labs and a 30 day event recorder to assess intermittent symptoms would be appropriate. electrolytes calcium magnesium thyroid function hormone levels etc as indicated. stop all caffeine or natural supplements. if all neg then anxiolytics and psych rx
iv had ecg holter monitor i suffer aniexty and panic attacks chances of sudden cardiac arrest due to palpatations?
if palpitations are not due to an arrhythmia you should not worry but i recommend having that documented with some tests like ecg holter event recorder
iv had ecg holter monitor i suffer aniexty and panic attacks chances of sudden cardiac arrest due to palpatations?
very little chance of sudden cardiac death. get help for your anxiety and panic disorder
is cardiac arrest a disease or just a sign?
it is a sign- the culmination and end result of any and all diseases.
i'm joining the army but fear i will get sudden cardiac arrest triggered by intensiv exercise? ! should i go cardiologist for tests to reassure?
hi. bayes theorem states that post test probability of an event prediction or disease is influenced by not only sensitivity and specificity of the test but also pretest probability of event or disease. your pretest probability of sudden cardiac arrest at your age in the absence of a horrible gene or dysrhythmia (very rare things) is essentially zero. since no test is perfect i advise no test.
what are my chances of having a sudden cardiac arrest death? normal echo. but have lots of couplets pvcs and sinus pauses.
but a lot depends on family history of sudden death and any more malignant arrythmias. you may want to have an event monitor placed and get an excercise treadmill test even though you are still youmg this is to look at any excercise induced arrythmias you may develop. many young people have arrythmias that resolve as you get older.
what are my chances of having a sudden cardiac arrest death? normal echo. but have lots of couplets pvcs and sinus pauses.
one should be evaluated for thyroid or chemical imbalances as well as intrinsic arrythmias.
how old can you be to use an automated external defibrillator?
the use of aed is always in emergency as a matter of life and death correct? so remember first to call 911 then anybody who is old enough to act responsibly and with basic knowledge on the use of aed (it is self -instructed for the most part after it's turned on) can use aed and probably be a life saver! if you are the only witness to cardiac arrest.
how can you tell when someone goes into cardiac arrest?
cardiac arrest as the name implies is when the heart stops. when your heart stops beating blood carrying oxygen does not flow to your body and brain. the body ceases all functions (you stop breathing you are unconscious the skin turns pale or blue). the best way to tell if someone is in cardiac arrest is to use a heart monitor (like carried by ems personel) to monitor activity of the heart.
how can you tell when someone goes into cardiac arrest?
that is the hallmark of cardiac arrest. the heart goes into ventricular fibrillation which is a heart rhythm that does not permit the blood to be pumped to the organs esp the heart and brain. by shocking -using an aed or a cardiac defibrillator the heart can be shocked into a normal sinus rhythm. this is what is going on when you see those shows where they say "all clear shock. ".
how often does the electric shock revive someone who had a cardiac arrest?
you heart has an electrical conduction system that controls how the heart muscle contracts. often in cardiac arrest that conduction system is sending disordered electrical signals. the shock sometimes given during cpr/acls is an attempt to "reset" the conduction system so the electric signals go back to the proper order.
how often does the electric shock revive someone who had a cardiac arrest?
this depends on lots of factors whether there is a heart rhythm that can be "shocked" whether the arrest was witnessed and whether or not the patient recieved cpr. finally the cause of the arrest matters. in the best case someone sees the arrest the rhythm is one in which a shock will work and is done quicky about 70% will regain a pulse with 40% surviving to leave the hospital.
how common is it to survive a cardiac arrest?
unfortunately uncommon. hard to say exactly & depends somewhat on what kind of cardiac arrest what other problems the person has how long before care etc. generally though for out-of-hospital arrests less than 20% survive long enough to be discharged from the hospital. also concerning is how often cardiac arrest is the 1st sign of underlying cad (plaque in vessels). see a proactive doctor!
how common is it to survive a cardiac arrest?
the probability of surviving cardiac arrest also depends on the availability of an aed(portable defibrillator) and the laws in your state pertaining to the use of aed's. the city of seattle has a 25% survival rate compared to the national average of around 5% survival due to readily available devices and user friendly laws.
how often does cpr work to revive someone from cardiac arrest?
with the exception of hypothermia (cold exposure) and certain drowning situations cpr is successful in less than 25% of cases.
how often does cpr work to revive someone from cardiac arrest?
cpr alone is not the answer depends on underlying medical condition - generally babies and younger population do better.
how long one can live after a massive heart attack with a cardiac arrest?
many many years with expert evaluation and follow up. very important is the follow up with your md.
how long one can live after a massive heart attack with a cardiac arrest?
the answer is completely individual depending upon the extent of the damage that was done to the heart muscle the age of the person and their other medical conditions. sustaining a cardiac arrest during a heart attack simply indicates there was a period of electrical instability and does not worsen the prognosis. even with massive heart attacks the survival can be decades long with best care.
how long one can live after a massive heart attack with a cardiac arrest?
i completely agree with dr. radwaner. \ best care is important to improve survival after a massive heart attack. very important to follow your doctor's recommendation.
in police academy. i have a mvp bicuspid tricuspid valve &slight electrical delay. is it safe to get tased for my certification (it's 5 seconds)?
what you mean by a slight electrical delay (av block sinus pause qt prolongation? ) but i would not recommend being tased given this condition. look to a cardiologist for this type of 'clearance'. wouldn't want to develop cardiac arrest trying to get a certification.
how common is sudden cardiac arrest in children?
the most common cause of cardiac arrest in children is due to respiratory failure.
how common is sudden cardiac arrest in children?
long qt syndrome and chest injury can lead to sudden cardiac arrhythmias and collapse.
how common is sudden cardiac arrest in children?
i don't have the exact statistics but sudden cardiac death is not a common thing across all age groups. children are the least affected one though given the lower prevalence of coronary artery disease congestive heart failure etc.
what can happen with qt prolongation?
long qt syndrome is a rare inherited disorder that can cause syncope (fainting) and cardiac arrest (heart attack). prolonged qt is an arrhythmia that can also be caused by certain drugs.
how high would your heart rate have to be to cause cardiac arrhythmia or cardiac arrest?
there are heart rhythmn disorders that do not begin with an elevated heart rate. not all cardiac arrhythmias are due to an elevated heart rate. there are rhythmn disorders that have a normal heart rate or even a slow heart rate. a normal or slow heart rate does not rule put an arrhythmia.
how high would your heart rate have to be to cause cardiac arrhythmia or cardiac arrest?
arrythmia is not defined by the heart rate. the arrhythmia refers to a disturbance in the way the electrical impulse is generated and transmitted inside the heart. extremes of slow and rapid heart rate are equivalent to a cardiac arrest since in these instances the heart is not pumping enough blood to maintain an effective blood pressure.
how high would your heart rate have to be to cause cardiac arrhythmia or cardiac arrest?
you have actually two questions. heart rhythem problems are of two kind one is when heart is beating faster then it should and second is when heart is beating slower then normal rate. they are due to disruption of normal heart rhythm. heart rate above 120 and below 60 are the one we are cocerned and we check on ekg. cardiac arrest is when heart stop beating and lot of time it is fatal and is emmergenc.
how can a pro athlete die from a cardiac arrest?
sometimes there is an unknown congenital heart defect which goes undiagnosed and then results in a sudden cardiac arrest during exercise. sometimes an object like a baseball hits the chest at just the right time during the cardiac cycle resulting in cardiac arrest. so there are many reasons for this unfortunate event to occur.
how can a pro athlete die from a cardiac arrest?
cardiomyopathy is either linked or acquired and represents a high risk condition to trigger dangerous arrhythmias during high stress situations. many times this predisposition can be discovered ahead of time with the appropriate screening ( history physical exam and ecg).
how can a pro athlete die from a cardiac arrest?
pro athletes who die have an unrecognized condition. the most common accounting for almost 50% is hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. dilated cardiomyopathy congenital coronary anomaly long qt syndrome brugada's syndrome arhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia and marfan's aortic dissection are other very rare causes. the incidence is 0. 75 per 100 000 - very rare!
how common is sudden cardiac arrest in school-age children?
1 case in 1-200000 people is the risk in the population as a whole. much less under middle school age.
how common is sudden cardiac arrest in school-age children?
the is usually one of 3 things: hocm comordio cordis (cc) or aberrant coronary artery (aca). hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy is obst. to outflow of the left ventricle by abn. muscle growth it is dx'd by ultrasound. cc happens when a sudden blow to the chest occurs at exactly the right time in the cardiac cycle. aca when crushed between aorta and pulmonary artery during heavy exertion.
how common is sudden cardiac arrest in school-age children?
this is an extremely rare phenomena. can happen in the setting of trauma to the chest or underlying congenital heart disease perhaps can also be seen in the setting of a deterioration of the heart muscle called cardiomyopathy but all in all this is much rarer than in adults fortunately.
what does heart attack arm pain feel like?
remember a heart attack is an occlusion of a coronary artery and doesn't mean cardiac arrest. if you develop sudden crushing chest pain not relieved with rest you may be having a heart attack. seek urgent medical attention. common symptoms are crushing chest pain sweating difficulty breathing nausea.
why do i have involuntary gasp for breath? 2 years ago i has cardiac arrest & has cpr & shock 99% blocked. blockage & has 2 stents.
all people sigh daily to redistribute surfactant throughout the lung and keep it expanded. damaged lungs perform the process more frequently. sighing is a large gasping breath.
why do i have involuntary gasp for breath? 2 years ago i has cardiac arrest & has cpr & shock 99% blocked. blockage & has 2 stents.
with your history see your doctor and get evaluated.
wat causes a heart attack. do all lead to cardiac arrest?
heart attack is usually caused by narrowing of a coronary artery to the heart. when the artery occludes from slow flow of blood through a narrowed artery damage to the heart muscle occurs. that is a heart attack. not all heart attacks lead to cardiac arrest.
wat causes a heart attack. do all lead to cardiac arrest?
some persons with a heart attack= myocardial infarction may have cardiac stoppage- arrest-ventricular standstill or fibrillation.
how common is sudden cardiac arrest in adolescents?
blow to the chest hypertrophy lqts and marfan syndrome are all possible causes.
how long after? surviving a? cardiac arrest? can? a patient be discharged?
depending on other factors it can be from 4-5 days to months or never. most patients who have a non cardiac cause for their arrest do not go home from the hospital.
how can i prevent hypovolemic cardiac arrest?
hypovolemic cardiac arrest is rare - usually from trauma (alot of blood loss all at once). in general a person should try to stay "euvolemic" - not too much fluid on board and not too little - dehydration. but even a fairly dehydrated person is more likely to have cardiac issues from blood electrolyte issues and not from hypovolemia.
how can i prevent hypovolemic cardiac arrest?
drink water don't bleed to death don't get cholera and not treat it etc.
how long after going into cardiac arrest does a person have to get to the hospital?
anyone experiencing cardiac arrest needs emergency care as soon as possible - chest compressions should be started right away and emergency medical services should be called - in some public places there are aeds (automated defibrillators) which can be used - regardless the brain will start to suffer long-term damage after 4 minutes without blood flow. cpr and shocks (if approp) is key.
how long after going into cardiac arrest does a person have to get to the hospital?
immediately call 911 for transport to the nearest emergency room.
how high is risk of heart attack (sudden cariac death) if basic blood tests are ok?
even if your cholesterol and triglycerides are normal that can't ensure you won't have a heart attack. your family history smoking and other factors can all contribute to cardiovascular risk. almost half of all initial signs of heart disease can be sudden cardiac arrest. the best thing to do is control what risk factors you can - blood pressure lipids and diet as well as exercise.
how long after cardiac arrest is a patient discharged?
over 90% of people with cardiac arrest do not survive the event. for survivors the answer varies with the cause of the arrest and what complications resulted from the arrest.
how long after cardiac arrest is a patient discharged?
depends on severity of damage caused by the event. if death does not occur in the first few days the recovery can be prolonged. recovery of independent living might not be possible. brain function could be permanently affected. in the most optimistic scenarios recovery takes several weeks.
what is. the. prognosis for a esrd patient with diabetes and septic arthritis pneumonia and went into cardiac arrest?
the description given puts this person in a very critical situation. what is described appears to have overwhelming infection that is overwhelming the body's ability to sustain itself. there is hope if the patient did not damage the brain when the heart stopped and the infection can be eradicated. even if this person should recover the long term prognosis would be poor for good quality of life.
what is. the. prognosis for a esrd patient with diabetes and septic arthritis pneumonia and went into cardiac arrest?
all patients on dialysis (d) have a higher mortality than their age-matched controls not on d. the fact that the patient wen into cardiac arrest is an ominous sign. to get a better answer you need to provide more information about the patient such as age and if the patient has diabetes.
what causes low potassium levels? could this cause me to nearly pass out every time i sit up?
low potassium can cause fatal abnormalities in heart rhythm resulting in cardiac arrest. it can cause severe muscle weakness abnormalities in kidney function slowing of bowel movement etc. symptoms of low potassium depends of the level rate of reduction and duration. low levels could be due to increased loss in the urine or diarrhea. rarely due to low intake or shifts in blood.
how can i prevent going into a sudden cardiac arrest?
too broad of a question. healthy life style and not smoking helps. if you have a weak heart or have an electrical abnormality your doctor would recommend electro physiologic study and ablation or defibrillator placement. talk specifically with your doctor if you have reason to believe you are at risk of cardiac arrest.
how can i prevent going into a sudden cardiac arrest?
good diet no smoking and exercise. but also one has to take into account one's genetic predisposition for having a cardiac risk. that's why its important to have check-up and have you doctor grade/evaluate your risk for heart disease.
i had tachycardia after my sinus fess & turbinates reduction surgery is this serious?
rhythm. sinus tachycardia is rapid heartbeat usually medication or stress induced usually of no consequence. atrial or supraventricular tachycardia is usually benign but might require medical attention. ventricular tachycardia is most serious can lead to cardiac arrest so you need immediate attention.
what are the chances of survival after a massive heart attack followed by angioplasty that causes a cardiac arrest? now ef 52% bp 100/70 and pulse 68
there are a lot of variables that determine prognosis like; time from when the heart attack started to when the angioplasty was done the ef -52% is good excercise capacity symptom status it would be important to be on a medical regimen to prevent a recurrence and then to try and go to cardiac rehab.
what are the risk factors of a 58 years female patient who survived from massive heart attack (ami) followed by angioplasty (ptca) and cardiac arrest?
those questions need to be asked of the patient's physicians. in general what you describe suggests serious damage was likely done during the heart attack but that can't be known from here. the state of the coronary bed and the myocardial function likewise. best to discuss with the physician(s) who know this patient best rather than generalize.
how could ventricular tachycardia feel different from atrial tachycardia?
can differentiate these 2 arrhythmia types although ventricular tachycardia generally causes more severe symptoms such as chest pain fainting and even a cardiac arrest. atrial tachycardia almost never causes cardiac arrest although can be felt as palpitations with lightheadedness or difficulty breathing.
how could i decrease risk of cardiac arrest?
behavior and choices! no smoking regular exercize check bp and cholesterol/ fats avoid atherosclerosis and coronary disease.
how could i decrease risk of cardiac arrest?
do u have cad or cardiomyopathy?
how do i decrease my chances of getting a cardiac arrest of the heart?
maintaining a healthy lifestyle consisting of a nutritionally balanced diet regular exercise a healthy weight not smoking reducing and managing stress and regular check-ups with your primary care provider will provide the best opportunity to avoid a heart attack and cardiac arrest.
how low can someone's blood pressure go before they go into cardiac arrest or shock?
the longer the mean bp lower than 65 the more likely.
how low can someone's blood pressure go before they go into cardiac arrest or shock?
shock is typically defined as a systolic bp less than 90. this is usually inadequate an explanation because the physiologic definition implies a drop in bp such that visceral organ blood flow is so reduced that mentation is altered and multisystem failure begins (with cns renal liver failure). lactic acid builds up when a lack of perfusion (and hence oxygen delivery) ensues.
how common is it for a young person suffering from sudden cardiac arrest?
congenital anomalies hyperlipidemia diabetes cocaine are known causes.
how common is it for a young person suffering from sudden cardiac arrest?
unless some one an underlying diseases such as hypertrophic cardiomyopathy the likelyhood of having a cardiac arrest is remote.
how does atrial fibrillation with ventricular standstill differ from fine v-fib?
they could look alike on ecg. both would also result in cardiac arrest. as no perfusion would result one would expect af waves to be less visible than vf very quickly. if arrest had been present for say more than 30sec. vf would be more likely as the af waves should likely not be visible.
when do you need a pacemaker?
a person would need a pacemaker if his heart has a conductive abnormality causing severe bradycardia second or third degree av block sick sinus syndrome or other conditions. the person would have symptoms associated with these conditions and sometimes short periods of cardiac arrest.
what do you advise if i have chest cardiac arrest heart attack?
if you have a cardiac arrest from a heart attack you will be unconscious. people near you should call 911 and initiate cpr including finding an aed if possible.
what to do if cardiac arrest while on ventilator?
depends why one is on the ventilator and what caused the arrest. 1st thing is start cpr and follow acls(advanced cardiac life support). one the patient has a good pulse and good heat rhythm then deterine the cause of the arrest.
how long does it take for one to turn blue after death like in cardiac arrest?
some cyanosis may occur before death.
how long does it take for one to turn blue after death like in cardiac arrest?
in a very short time skin color will change from lack of oxygen. on average 30-60 seconds.
how to tell if i am at risk of sudden cardiac arrest?
the best single test to stratify risk for cardiac arrest is an echocardiogram. of course there are other factors that you should discuss with your cardiologist.
having 8. 8 level of coumadin (warfarin) in the system could cause internal bleeding and cardiac arrest?
when you are on coumadin (warfarin) in general your goal for the inr will be between 2-3. the higher the number the higher your risk for bleeding. bleeding can occur anywhere in the body- including intraabdominal bleeding bleed in the brain etc. so you need to make sure you follow up with your doctor regularly make sure you be careful with your diet and other medication.
having 8. 8 level of coumadin (warfarin) in the system could cause internal bleeding and cardiac arrest?
inr therapeutic for dvt mechanical valves etc is 2. 5 -3. 5 higher inr may be associated sometimes with spontaneous or post traumatic bleeding. enough bleeding can cause shock and even cardiac arrest on occasion. needs treatment to get to correct range. carefully to avoid precipitating clotting.
how does sudden fright or shock lead to a cardiac arrest?
a sudden fright or other event can cause a rush of adrenaline (aka epinephrine) that then causes an increased risk of a fatal arrhythmia. this would be vanishingly rare without severe preexisting disease.
how does sudden fright or shock lead to a cardiac arrest?
it's not a very common. but a sudden shock or fright may lead to a surge of adrenaline (your body's way of preparing for "fight or flight"). in someone with pre-existing heart disease or a rare genetic predisposition the increase in heart rate & blood pressure can result in rupture of a blockage in a coronary artery (heart attack) or directly cause a dangerous rapid arrhythmia (cardiac arrest).
had ekg echo &blood tests normal. any reason to fear cardiac arrest? severe anxiety & hypochondria. nauseous and sweaty. 18 years old
your age and the normal tests which i assume were part of a normal physical evaluation appear to make you anextremely low risk for cardiac arrest. so now you have to figure out why you are so anxious about getting sick and dying. seeing a therapist would be the next step to help you get over this uncomfortable feeling.
had ekg echo &blood tests normal. any reason to fear cardiac arrest? severe anxiety & hypochondria. nauseous and sweaty. 18 years old
in setting of a normal ekg and echo sudden cardiac death and arrest is minimal. there are cirmustances where undetected electrical abnormalities can precipitate arrhythmias but those are rare. seek help for your anxiety.
i have lbbb hit the gym everyday. great bp heart function good clean cath ef 50-55 lung function great per test. should i fear cardiac arrest?
if you have all those normal studies you are at very low risk for cardiac arrest.
what do doctors mean when they say something is rare or rarely occurs? such as anaphylaxis or cardiac arrest in a 28 yr old
a rare occurrence is something which is not the usual; it is uncommon. this does not really address the question of what percent chance will be the event. some things for example are considered rare occurring at a rate of one out of one hundred times; another rare event might only occur once in 1000 times. as one can see "rare" is a relative term; it's not precise.
what do doctors mean when they say something is rare or rarely occurs? such as anaphylaxis or cardiac arrest in a 28 yr old
but i would consider a condition which occurs in less than 1:10000 to be very rare. yet this is just a subjective assessment although most would likely agree that anything with less than a 1:1000 chance would be considered rare.
what to do if heart attack or go into cardiac arrest. is this likely?
if you think you are having a heart attack seek immediate medical attention. if you have a cardiac arrest someone else will have to do it for you.
what leads to your body shocks through cardiac arrest?
i am not sure that i understand your question please clarify.
what would cause a cardiac arrest after a sinus arrest?
sinus arrest results in asystole. the atrioventricular node may rescue with an idioventricular rhythm in the 30's. if this doesn't rescue within 10 seconds syncope usually happens. if it extends beyond 20 seconds this is cardiac arrest. if rescue pacing or cpr not started brain death occurs within 5 minutes. total asystole may be caused by acute severe hyperkalemia.
how common is ptsd after heart attack and how can it be treated?
especially if you had a cardiac arrest and resuscitation. depression is also very common. drugs do help you but best treatment is group discussion with similar patients and developing skills to cope. good recovery is possible and there is nothing to worry.
how rare is sca (sudden cardiac arrest) in people with anxiety/depression taking setraline 50 mg?
about 2% of 21000 pts on sertraline had sudden death. can reference this: <link>
how come i have to have a blood test and an ecg tomorrow because of my eating disorder?
individuals well below ideal body weight especially in anorexia nervosa tend to be malnourished. be aware that if you lose weight strictly by restricting your diet without exercising half the weight you lose is muscle! so you also become less physically capable weaker and. the heart is a special kind of muscle! most deaths from an result from cardiac arrest due to a combination of factors.
what number of types of cardiac arrest are there?
cardiac arrest is when your heart stop working due to different causes including heart attacks and ventricular arrhythmias.
what causes the heart too beat to fast in sudden cardiac arrest and makes the electrical system go crazy?
ventricular fibrillation causing sudden cardiac death can occur in people with normal or abnormal heart. those with no structural heart disease such as long qt syndrome brugada syndrome etc cause by genetic mutation in ionic channels. in people with structural heart disease coronary artery disease is common in people over 50 and in younger people cardiomyopathy specially hypertrophic cardiomy
how can low potassium levels cause heart problems?
potassium level is tightly regulated by the kidneys and its balance is vital for normal functioning of heart muscles kidneys etc. low potassium can cause fatal abnormalities in heart rhythm resulting in cardiac arrest.
how relevant are premature ventricular contractions in idiopathic cardiac arrest? are there any preceding symptoms?
rarely pvc hitting badly in ekg in cycle can cause arrythmias including vt v fib.
how relevant are premature ventricular contractions in idiopathic cardiac arrest? are there any preceding symptoms?
u are jumping from a to z. i hope no one had cardiac arrest. most people have some pvcs (extra beats or skip beats) usually harmless in absence of heart disease but can be aggravated by stress caffeine thyroid disease or electrolyte imbalance. with heart disease pvcs can trip off a serious rapid arrhythmia. symptoms include palpitations dizziness and fainting.
have sinus tachycardia/pvcs/sinus arrhythmia/palpitations. 23 years old. normal ecg/echo/blood tests. what are my chances for cardiac arrest?
at 25 possibility of cardiac arrest is remote even with family history. sinus tachycardia is a rapid otherwise normal beat. sinus arrythmia refers to the normal variation in pulse rate with the breathing cycle seen in young athletes. pvcs are extra beats generated in lower chamber for many reasons rarely serious. palpitations are literally the awareness of your heartbeat caused by any of these.
have sinus tachycardia/pvcs/sinus arrhythmia/palpitations. 23 years old. normal ecg/echo/blood tests. what are my chances for cardiac arrest?
but full evaluation of heart endocrine thyroid is important.
have sinus tachycardia/pvcs/sinus arrhythmia/palpitations. 23 years old. normal ecg/echo/blood tests. what are my chances for cardiac arrest?
when cardiac mechanical function and structure are normal the risk of cardiac arrest is low unless there is an associated ischemic or metabolic problem.
what is the average time a patient who is in coma due to a cardiac arrest for 15-25 mins will take to show signs of improvement?
if they had no spontaneous circulation requiring cpr for >15 minutes the prognosis is very poor. there may be irreversible brain injury. the prognosis is not determined by the timing however. it's determined by their condition. if there's no brainstem activity there will likely be no recovery. if they have higher cortical activity recovery is likely will be slow and may be incomplete.
how serious does cad have to be to cause sca?
the narrowing of coronary artery with rupture of a plaque and thrombosis can lead to heart attack and cardiac arrest even with moderate disease. that is why it is so important to modify your risk factors. at the same someone with severe narrowing may remain asymptomatic till they suddenly have a heart attack.
what are the chances of a 23yo female to have a heart attack or to die suddenly?
heart attacks in people under 30 are rare but sudden cardiac arrest can occur with cocaine alcohol & other recreational drug use. also people with a congenital heart defect (which may previously have gone undetected) can also die from these suddenly. here is an article addressing the non-drug causes: <link> info about drugs & alcohol's effect: <link>
how is a heart attack and cardiac arrest different?
heart attack only means that there is area of the heart deprived of blood flow and the muscles supplied by the involved blood vessel die. cardiac arrest means the heart stops beating the person has a sudden death and has to be resuscitated.
how old must i be before i can use an aed(automated external defibrillator)?
anyone who knows how to use it can use it. it's not regulated by law. it stands to reason that if someone experiences a cardiac arrest the most senior person who is available will take over. with adults it may be a medical professional. if a child applies the aed and is the only one there it may be life saving. if a trained adult arrives on scene they will take over.
how come so many soccer players die from cardiac arrest when they are still young?
sudden cardiac arrest or death in young athelets is very rare (about 100 cases per year in usa). mostly due to ventricular fibrillation hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy congenital heart disease cardiac arryhtmias long qt syndrome and commotio cordis.
how come some peopke die while exercising? i get nervous sometimes working out because i get palpitations and think i'll have cardiac arrest. anxiety?
can have mi at rest if a vessel thrombosis. but if narrow and heart wants more oxygen during exercize the supply may be limited and cause angina-heart pain or myocardial infarction as next step. to alleviate your concern see cardiologist and do monitored exercize-stress testing.
how come some peopke die while exercising? i get nervous sometimes working out because i get palpitations and think i'll have cardiac arrest. anxiety?
yes. you have nailed it. people who die from exercise have heart disease. it is very unlikely to occur in someone your age or with good health.
is there a correlation between people that are prone to having (benign) pvcs and sudden cardiac arrest? (pvcs at a rate from 0-500 per day)
left ventricular dysfunction or structural heart disease.
my grandpa died from a heart attack even after they didresuscitation about 15 minutes later. should they havekept trying?
survival from cpr is very poor. if a cardiac arrest occurs in a hospital the rate of survival without brain injury is less than 10%. usually there will be permanent and maybe very severe brain injury if a patient goes without breathing or heart beat for more than 5-10 minutes but often the timing is uncertain so we frequently try anyway just in case but knowing it almost never works.
what mechanism that high potassium causes cardiac arrest? i just know high k+ causes hyper excitability of cells?
when cardiac muscle cells fire they use up part of the electrochemical gradient they maintain in life. they are repolarized by an outward potassium (k+) flux across the plasma membrane. this outward k+ current depends on the k+ electrochemical gradient. if the "outside" k+ (in blood & interstitial fluid) is very high that destroys the k+ electrochemical gradient the cells can't repol; they stop
what happens if in sick sinus syndrome if you take diltiazem. chest pains and palpitations aren't improving with diltiazem. worried it's sick sinus?
u can't use av blockers in sss unless u have a pacemaker it may control tachycardia but may also worsen bradycardia which may result in stoke cardiac arrest or demise.
help please? how is a pacemaker affected during a heart attack?
a heart attack usually doesn't affect an electronic pacemaker. the device will help prevent the heart from slowing excessively and usually won't be affected by rapid heart action. if a cardiac arrest occurs and defibrillation is necessary the electric shock could possibly affect the pacer circuitry.
how can someone have cardiac arrest from tonsil surgery?
cardiac arrest related to tonsil surgery is the same as cardiac arrest from any anesthetic procedure. there are multiple possible causes but usually hypoxia or a toxic effect of the anesthetic are involved and often an underlying known or unsuspected cardiac problem. it is a complex problem and fortunately uncommon.
why should one not take nitroglycerin if they are in cardiac arrest?
if one is in cardiac arrest you are in no shape to take anything you are going to be dead unless someone helps you. generally the blood pressure is extremely low and nitrolglycerine will only make it worse in most cases.
what causes sudden cardiac arrest?
sudden cardiac death had several causes: coronary disease or heart attack may cause sudden cardiac death but also sudden death can occur in patients with cardiac abnormality of the heart muscle that can be detected on echo cardiogram and sometime undetected on cardiac echo electrical genetic anomaly may cause sudden death
what causes sudden cardiac arrest?
hi. a sudden heart attack (mi) is caused when a lesion in an artery that projects into the lumen (called an atheroma and made of inflammatory cells cholesterol and junk = "hardening of the arteries") has a surface exposed to the blood cells that promotes clotting. the clot (thrombus) forms and blocks the artery; no more blood gets thru. that part of the heart gets no more oxygen and dies = mi.
how to go into cardiac arrest from a tonsil surgery?
patients may develop cardia arrest from any kind of surgery. regarding to solar surgery ( tonsillectomy ) since anatomically are located close to carotids it may cause mechanical pressure on carotid receptors and cause bradycardia and possibly arrest. it's not very common anyway.
how to know if i just went into cardiac arrest?
if you go into cardiac arrest after about 10 seconds you will pass out lights out. if the cardiac contraction and rythm do not resume spontaneously you will be brain dead within 5 minutes. so after 10 seconds if you do not get rescued you will never know if you went into cardiac arrest.
how likely is it that broken heart syndrome causes the heart to stop whithout symptoms?
broken heart syndrome is thought to be caused by a sudden huge surge of adrenaline which can cause a severe but usually temporary weakening of the heart pumping. it is also called takotsubo cardiomyopathy. the heart does not stop with this condition but there is a small risk of ventricular fibrillation (aka cardiac arrest) where the heart beats very fast and needs a shock to restore it to normal.
how to tell if these are signs of cardiac arrest?
cardiac arrest means the heart stops. unfortunately cardiac arrest is too often the first "symptom" of coronary artery disease. think james gandolfini for example.
i have been diagnosed with brugada syndrome and have an icd that has worked fine. i am wanting to find out more about this disease and wanting to know if there are any help in dealing with the severe anxiety about my defibrillator going off.
brugada syndrome is a relatively common familial arrhythmia syndrome found in patients presenting with syncope or sudden cardiac arrest. it is very understandable that you are having symptoms of anxiety about the defibrillator. my advice: talk to your pcp or cardiologist and ask for a referral to a counselor or psychiatrist. in the meantine refer to: familyheart. stanford. edu/clinics/brugada2. htm
what are the chances of a young person suffering from sudden cardiac arrest? is this common?
cardiac arrest in the young in extremely rare
worried about sudden cardiac arrest 24 female clear ecg clear blood work had seven day holter few years ago no history of sca mum has svt?
you state you have no family history of sudden cardiac death and a normal blood work and ecg. focus on a healthy lifestyle - eat well with mediterranean style diet exercise regularly don't smoke get a restful sleep each night and create a positive social group around you! it is important to live life and not worry! be sure to get a regular check up with your doctor as insurance!
how much time can a person be in cardiac arrest and survive with little to no brain damage when they are in icy?
less than 5 minutes is the normal temperature answer. there have been anecdotal events of people that have been hours in icy water that regain consciousness with no brain damage it is thought to be due to a decrease in metabolism. no real time known due to the fact that we can't really experiment to find out and we only see it when it happens in real life. not so common.
help can cocaine stabilize cardiac arrest?
no. cocaine can actually cause cardiac arrest. why do you ask?
help can cocaine stabilize cardiac arrest?
a person in cardiac arrest is pretty much dead. or are you using the term in some novel way i'm not aware of? if you're referring to yourself i'm pretty sure that you're not in cardiac arrest. using cocaine might cause you to be under arrest but that's another story.
i have a ct w/ contrast later today. i'm nervous because i read a serious side effect of the contrast is cardiac arrest. should i refuse the contrast?
you are more likely to get in a car wreck on the way to the ct than have a fatal reaction to the dye. for actual stats see: <link> there are risks of allergy and concerns if patients have bad kidneys going into the test. general advice is to drink fluids afterwards to help flush the stuff out.
i have a ct w/ contrast later today. i'm nervous because i read a serious side effect of the contrast is cardiac arrest. should i refuse the contrast?
24 year old woman with concern over contrast for ct study. you should be more at ease with the contrast for this study. serious side effects are rare with contrast dye. if the ct scan with contrast is needed to get an accurate diagnosis the benefits will outweigh the risks which are rare with contrast dye if you have good kidney function. if you take metformin for diabetes it may need to be held.
i'm tachycardic i'm on 2. 5mg of bisop it keeps my hr between 70-80 beats a minute but my pulse in my neck so strong at times is that normal?
the "strength" of the carotid artery pulse is subjective and only has significance in certain clinical settings such as syncope and cardiac arrest. in these settings a weak pulse may indicate significantly low blood pressure. a strong pulse would be a good sign and absence of a pulse would indicate cardiac arrest.
in a 60 second period i skip 11 heart beats. is this a problem.
if the heart skips beats then there could be an underlying electrical problem such as an arrhythmia. in this situation one should attend the doctor and ask for an e. c. g. preferably when experiencing the skipped beats to find out what is going on. worst case scenario it could be a serious abnormality like sick sinus syndrome which can cause sudden cardiac arrest. or it could be totally benign.
why are pvcs felt under throat? what are the chances your heart stops after a benign pvcs episode?
the heart always pauses after a pvc to get back into the original rhythm that was interrupted by the premature beat. this pause is called a "complete compensatory pause" in contrast to premature atrial beats which are "incompletely compensatory". benign pvcs by definition never result in cardiac arrest.
what causes sudden cardiac arrest in young people?
a number of causes underlying cardiac disease like hypertrophic cardiomyopathy arrythmogenic right heart cardiomyopathy could be sudden clot if has a familial disposition to hypercoagulability ( leiden factor v protein s or c) wolf parkinson white rarely long qt syndrome ( if given the wrong meds) other genetic variants as well as cocaine amphentamines alcohol poisoning and other drugs.
what causes sudden cardiac arrest in young people?
simple answer is an arrhythmia or sudden abnormal electrical impulses in heart. hard answer is what causes it to happen. i agree some risk factors include prolong qt syndrome (or iatrogenic prolong qt) and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (ex: young athlete collapses on court). of course illicit drugs and certain prescription drug overdoses lead to arrhythmias too.
what causes sudden cardiac arrest in young people?
we know some risk factors - prolonged qt syndrome hypertrophic cardiomyopathy blunt trauma to the chest possibly sudep (sudden unexpected death in epilepsy) drug overdoses & cardiac complications of anorexia nervosa. check out the cdc/nih registry for more info: <link>
i have a rbbb and suffer from anxiety. i was prescribed lexapro (escitalopram). will this cause problems? i'm nervous of having sudden cardiac arrest or death
complete or incomplete? see a cardiologist or internist.
would an overdose of benadryl (diphenhydramine) put you into cardiac arrest?
refrain from overdosing to yourself or any body else
what could happen if a person overdosed on 2-3grams of propanolol and 60 mgs of klonopin (clonazepam)?
these are very high doses of both medications. the propanolol can cause severe hypotension or bradycardia or even cardiac arrest. the klonopin (clonazepam) can cause severe respiratory depression. this person needs to be in the hospital for at least observation if not medications to support heart rate and blood pressure and to reverse the klonipin.
what is the primary medication for patients in cardiac arrest?
the medications given during resuscitation of a cardiac arrest patient depends on the heart's rhythm on the heart monitor. it also depends on the age of the cardiac arrest patient since the protocols are different for adults and children. one medication commonly used is epinephrine but it really does depend on the factors described!
why do so many soccer players die from cardiac arrest when they're still young?
there are huge numbers of soccer players in the world. some who have congenital sudden death risk will die when they are young. 'so many' is actually probably not that many statistically. because soccer is a high degree of exertion one would however expect more chance of cardiac arrest than say playing golf or curling.
how likely is it to die or have severe complications from breast augmention surgery? such as cardiac arrest or blood clot?
the risks you describe are anesthetic complications which are usually less than 1 of 1000. breast augmentation does have complications of infection or wound related problems on the order of 2-4%. late complications like capsular contracture or deflation may occur in 20% or more patients.
how likely is it to die or have severe complications from breast augmention surgery? such as cardiac arrest or blood clot?
there are several factors to this question. there are several factors that can increase your risks such as obesity smoking diabetes high blood pressure and certain genetic disorders that cause increase blood clotting. even if you have no risk factors there is still a risk of general anesthesia. then there are risks of infection and complications from the surgery.
mother 58 years. heart attack (ami) followed by ptca and cardiac arrest. discharged 5 days earlier. ef = 52%. will she take full bed rest? any risk?
that ef is adequate for a good life if head and rest of organs are ok now. follow up with cardiology and echocardiograms.
what condition is worse: a heart attack or cardiac arrest?
cardiac arrest is worse unless resusitaed in time one would be brain dead
what condition is worse: a heart attack or cardiac arrest?
a heart attack means damage to heart muscle usually from a blocked coronary artery while cardiac arrest means the heart beat has stopped altogether. either can be fatal.
what causes tachycardia/pounding heart wheb laying down? not anxiety
arrhythmia which mean abnormal heart beat could be simple tachycardia easy treat it with medication. or it could be complicated and with consequences like atrial fibrillation could cause a clots to the vital organs in the body like brain with stroke or kidney or guts. or it could be a bad tachycardia that could lead to fibrillation and cardiac arrest. so please see a doctor
what is the difference between a heart attack heart failure and cardiac arrest?
a heart attack is when a blood vessel to the heart blocks off and a part of the heart is damaged. a cardiac arrest can be the result of a heart attack. cardiac arrest is when the heart suddenly stops pumping for one reason or another. a heart attack can cause cardiac arrest. a cardiac arrest isn't necessarily caused by a heart attack. heart failure is when the heart can't supply the body's demands
what is the difference between a heart attack cardiac arrest and a stroke?
a heart attack is when a blood vessel to the heart blocks off and a part of the heart is damaged. a cardiac arrest can be the result of a heart attack. cardiac arrest is when the heart suddenly stops pumping for one reason or another. a heart attack can cause cardiac arrest. a cardiac arrest isn't necessarily caused by a heart attack. a stroke is blocked brain blood vessels and resultant brain dam
what is the difference between cardiac arrest a heart attack and heart failure?
cardiac arrest: pumping or rhythm abnormality so severe that the flow of blood thought the heart is super low or zero - incompatible with life unless successfully treated. heaty attack - region of heart muscle get less oxygen than it needs so the muscle dies. heart failure - heart is unable to adequately deliver oxygen to the body or requires an unhealthy amount of filling pressure to do so.
what is the treatment for the ph imbalance resulting from cardiac arrest?
bicarbonate (sodium bicarbonate) is used sometimes to counter the ph imbalance resulting from cardiac arrest. not included otherwise in most acls protocols.
when someone is resuscitated after cardiac arrest is consciousness regained immediately? or could it take any longer?
after someone suffers cardiac arrest resuscitation is attempted. if successful the person usually does not regain consciousness immediately. it usually takes time for the person to wake up and the amount of time it takes is very variable. it's not like what you see on tv or in the movies!
what is the difference between cardiac arrest and a stroke?
a cardiac arrest happens when there is a rhythm or pumping problem with the heart so bad that there is essentially not enough blood flow to support life. ma stroke happens when there is not enough oxygen delivery to the brain (or spinal cord) and the neurons (brain cells) die.
how is it possible for people go into cardiac arrest and. then have their heart start beating again unaided?
that would not be true cardiac arrest.
having vng testing done. looked it up online and it says side effect of cardiac arrest? ! is this common and would it be immediate?
though unlikely transient disturbance in cardiac rhythm can occur and if severe theoretically induce arrest the facility should be equipped to easily handle such a rare occurrence. specifically ask them to allay your concerns. the risk in your demographic is vary small if you have the suspect condition then you run the risk spontaneously with each occurrence of symptoms anyway.
had multiple ecgs and event recorder would it have picked up any abnormality that can lead to sudden cardiac arrest i suffer severe aniexty?
there's always an outside chance they missed something but it's small. prolonged qt would have been seen & there would have been electrical evidence of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. other possibilities would have been picked up along the way (see other answer). anxiety prompts epinephrine burst & throws you into scary sustained tachycardia only feeding the panic. vicious cycle but no flatlining.
had multiple ecgs and event recorder would it have picked up any abnormality that can lead to sudden cardiac arrest i suffer severe aniexty?
if your holter study is normal and your ekgs were done when you were feeling bad and are all normal then take a deep breath and relax. you might want to followup with a cardiologist who is a specialist in electro physiology to explain your studies and give you an opinion but at this point you are good. all the best.
holter showed hr was constantly around 100 and recorded # and duration of tachy beats. yet cardiologist overall comment was no sustained arrhythmia.
holter monitors are usually put on to monitor arrhythmia that could ultimately lead to cardiac arrest. just simple tachycardia around 100 is to be monitored but perhaps your cardiologist is looking for a particular arrhythmia that might lead to an arrest. i would suggest you speak with your cardiologist and ask him/her what they are looking for and explain your concern.
how common is sudden cardiac arrest at 24 had past ecgs holter monitor no problems?
sudden cardiac death is uncommon in 24 year olds. the most common causes of cardiac death in young people would be a congenital abnormality of the heart or hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. both of these could be diagnosed with an echocardiogram an ultrasound of the heart.
how does the aha distinguish between cardiac arrest and a heart attack?
cardiac arrest is when heart stops. no further heartbeat. heart attack is when a coronary artery gets blocked and there is no further blood or oxygen going to a portion of myocardium (heart muscle) that dies unless flow is restored quite rapidly.
my ekg shows early repolarization. can i have a cardiac arrest? is early repolarization dangerous? i am 22 years old?
early repolarization is completely normal. you have no more risk of cardiac arrest than i do (actually much less than i since you're 22 and i'm 62).
my sister went with oxygen for 7 minutes and a heart attack she a diabetic and had very low blood pressure kidney damage will she have brain damage?
adults who are deprived of oxygen due to cardiac arrest for over 5 minutes usually suffer brain damage. however since she did not have a cardiac arrest and despite very low blood pressure she may have had enough cerebral circulation to avoid significant brain damage. however because of diabetes and smoking history she may have come vascular disease which increases her risk. hope for the best.
should everyone buy a defibrillator for their home?
an automatic external defibriillator (aed) is important for cardiac arrest situations however it is not practical for every home to have one unless you or your family members are at increased risk. aeds cost about $1000-$1200 battery needs to be replaced every 5 years ($90-$110) and the pads (adult & pediatric) need to be replaced every 18-24 months ($100 each).
what can cause your body shocks through cardiac arrest?
not sure what you're asking. if you have cardiac arrest you're dead unless something is done. cpr and a defibrillation(electrical shock treatment)presently give one the best chance of survival. if you meant something else please be clearer with your question.
what are the signs of a heart attack or cardiac arrest?
read this: <link> wikipedia. org/wiki/myocardial_infarction sign of cardiac arrest is no pulse and you fall over and look like you're dead. heart association web site has lots of information
what is the difference between cardiac arrest and cardiac distress?
distress means you're in trouble. cardiac arrest means you're dead. you might get out of distress without help not so arrest.
how effective is life support for treating cardiac arrest?
if the arrest is from heart rhythm problem then good bls (=cpr) + defibrillation can at least temporarily save 20-60% (studies vary a lot). when cpr used on terminally ill pts from perceived obligation "to try " rate more like 4-8%. combined about 15% respond positively to get to icu to work on fixing what caused the arrest.
how effective is tracheal intubation for treating cardiac arrest?
securing airway with the breathing tube is the recognized part of the advanced cardiac life support algorithm i. e. it is very effective. however cardiac arrest per se in adults often happens due to abnormal electrical activity in the heart and that is why defibrillators whether in the healthcare facilities or for public use are recommended to be used first.
how effective is atropine for treating cardiac arrest?
atropine is not used for cardiac arrest. about the only effective drug in cardiac arrest is epinephrine. once cardiac rhythm other than vfib or pulseless electronic activity occurs we then can try other drugs depending on what's present but at that point the arrest has converted to another pathologic state
idk why but for some reason i step thinking i'm going to die of cardiac arrest it scares me i don't have any health or heart condition please tell i'm overthinking?
please have an evaluation by a physician. you could be missing something important. without a medical cause it sounds like you are experiencing anxiety related to your physical functioning. you may benefit from discussing this with a psychologist. often relaxation training helps. trying to get over this on your own may not work and your anxiety might worsen.
my mother has fdiffuse cerebral edema because of cardiac arrest. she is having little body movements little eye opening but no concious yet.
the edema is from leakage from vessels and cells which were deprived of oxygen and blood supply while the heart was stopped. this prevents them from working. depending upon the length of time the brain was deprived as well as the resistance of the cells as the edema clears there will be some recovery. there is no simple way to predict the timing; hopefully there will be much to gain. l
should there be portable cardiac arrest machines in every room of your fitness center in plain site?
there should be at least one in every gym in plain view so time is not wasted in an emergency.
should there be portable cardiac arrest machines in every room of your fitness center in plain site?
in new york state it is the law to have one at the gym. not one in every room.
how effective is epinephrine for treating cardiac arrest?
epinephrine remains a component of the acls training by american heart association. measuring 'how' effective it is is difficult. it is generally considered one of the few drugs that helps in cardiac arrest from 'experience'. a controlled study isn't available. cardiac arrest has a very high mortality we continue to consider epi effective while most other drugs have fallen off the chart.
how effective is an induced coma for treating cardiac arrest?
when you have cardiac arrest you are dead. induced coma is done only when you are alive. as such it isn't a treatment for cardiac arrest. if a patient happens to be resuscitated from cardiac arrest inducing coma can be a consideration to hope the brain will recover with less metabolic demand on it. it isn't done regularly. we are considering if cooling post arrest survival is as useful as thought
how effective is cardiopulmonary resuscitation (cpr) for treating cardiac arrest?
less than 10% of people with cardiac arrest and cpr survive overall. after 10 min of cpr survival is miniscule. early cpr and defibrillation within less than 4-5min give the best outcomes. las vegas casinos with abundant automated defibrillators trained staff and people watching on monitors have the fastest response and best results.
how effective is coronary catheterization for treating cardiac arrest?
cardiac catheterization is not a treatment for cardiac arrest. cath is a diagnostic procedure not a treatment. cardiac arrest means you're dead unless the status is changed immediately. it requires immediate treatment and diagnosis afterward assuming treatment causes return to a status compatible with life.
how effective is an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator for treating cardiac arrest?
the icd is probably the most effective treatment for cardiac arrest as it is in place and monitoring for a shockable ventricular tachyarrhythmia. it is the fastest way to accomplish defibrillation.
how effective is airway management for treating cardiac arrest?
if you don't take care of the airway and get air/oxygen into the person with cardiac arrest they will stay dead. if you get the heart restarted but there isn't any air/oxygen going into the patient they will die.
how effective is defibrillation for treating cardiac arrest?
defibrillation is the only effective treatment for the ventricular fibrillation if cardiac arrest is due to vfib and not pea.
how effective is therapeutic hypothermia for treating cardiac arrest?
hypothermia doesn't treat cardiac arrest. if the patient has been resuscitated from cardiac arrest and is now alive hypothermia can help improve eventual survival to hospital discharge and with better function assuming survival. how effective it is is still an open question.
how effective is amiodarone (nexterone) for treating cardiac arrest?
cardiac arrest means you're dead and the heart isn't contracting amiodarone doesn't help that. it can sometimes convert vtach or stabilize the cardiac rhythm after electrical conversion of ventricular fibrillation but once vfib is converted the arrest is over and you're treating instablility. the only drug that may help arrest is epinephrine.
i have pernicious anaemia had two injections of vitamin b12 last year which caused me to collapse and cardiac arrest so now they won't give me anythng?
i do not know what caused the collapse/ cardiac arrest(faint or go to er? ) - which is serious so before taking another form would discuss with doctor and would take the first dose in the doctor's office where you can be monitored. high dose oral supplementation is effective as well as is sublingual and foods with b12 (liver beef eggs) f/u/w/ doc <link>
hello i am from india. the question i have is that my dad had survived a cardiac arrest in 2013 due to a block in 3 valves. will it pass on to me to?
i'm wondering if "valves" should be "coronary arteries". this sort of heart problem usually isn't genetic or familial but the result of lifestyle primarily tobacco diet exercise obesity. if diabetes keep it in good control. there are exceptions however; if any doubt discuss with your doctor or your dad's.
hello i am from india. the question i have is that my dad had survived a cardiac arrest in 2013 due to a block in 3 valves. will it pass on to me to?
but you will have cardiac risk factors. diabetes high cholesterol lac of physical activity obesity smoking street drugs will increase your cardiac disease possibility. you can alter it by diet exercise.
heart is supposed to beat like 1. 2 noticed it beats like 1. 1 vfast/strong then a long pause then 2 and rate slows. felt it couple times/day i'm 20 and i exercise daily. cardiac arrest coming? !
i am not sure what u mean when describing ur heart beat. what is 1. 2 & what is a 1. 1 beat? from ur description at the very least we know (1) heart beat is irregular & (2) u feel it. do u feel it in ur chest? or do u check ur pulse (w/ ur fingers)? next time it happens count how many times it beats in a minute. better yet get onto healthtap prime to discuss ur symptoms. u may need a holter.
i take bystolic (nebivolol) 2. 5 mg for svt. recently i have learned that beta blockers can cause cardiac arrest. is it worth the risk for a benign condition?
in patients with conduction system disease characterized by interrupted signal transmission beta blocker can exacerbate the condition; the prescribing physician should know and have evaluated this.
is ventricular fibrillation a type of cardiac arrhythmia?
ventricular fibrillation is the most serious cardiac rhythm disturbance. the lower chambers quiver and the heart can't pump any blood causing cardiac arrestthe heart's electrical activity becomes disordered. when this happens the heart's lower (pumping) chambers contract in a rapid unsynchronized way. the heart pumps little or no blood. collapse and sudden cardiac arrest follows.
sometimes it feels like my heart skips a beat or palpitates. happens at rest or when walking. is this dangerous? if not what is it?
source of the extra or skipped heartbeats and how often they come. most often it comes from the atria so they are not as dangerous as the ones that come from venticles. but you really need to find out and the only way to determine the difference is with a cardiogram. conduction abnormalities can result in cardiac arrest in rare instances. get to a doctor so you can figure this out.
would ecg show brugada syndrome scared to sleep no family history normal ecgs in past no fainting need reasurance read stories of girls dying in their sleep im 25 f how rare is it?
brugada syndrome(bs) is rare. it is 9 times more frequent in males and very much more common in asians. there is a distinction between bs and a brugada ekg pattern(bekg). the bs patient has had a history of cardiac arrest or syncope or other high risk factors. bekg type 1 pattern is higher risk. type 1 ekg is present in approximately 12 out of 1000 people in japan.
would ecg show brugada syndrome scared to sleep no family history normal ecgs in past no fainting need reasurance read stories of girls dying in their sleep im 25 f how rare is it?
with the information you provide the chances of you having brugada syndrome are very remote. unless you have a specific reason to think you are at risk of sudden cardiac arrest you should perhaps find something else to worry about.
would a clear ecg no family history 25 f suffer aniexty rule out sudden cardiac arrest?
medical checks done once yearly and adopting a healthy life style will keep you healthy. this means eating healthy(plant based diet reduce fats in the diet and maintain healthy weight) and exercise regularly(a daily walk is the best preventive medicine that you can take/do to avoid heart disease. ecg/ekg is a reasonable screen but tells us very little about the condition of your heart.
had clear ecgs around 40 in life time last one today 25 f no family history except svt risk for sudden cardiac arrest? suffer aniexty which im under treatment for kp worrying about sca
i understand your distress. feel good about functioning of your heart as your ecg is normal. believe in healing powers of your body. treatment of anxiety will be beneficial with: seeing a psychiatrist for therapy for stress in your life resolving emotional turmoil learning coping skills and medication breathing and music relaxation visual imagery and meditation. cardiologist for follow up.
should i be scared of sca? ! normal ekgs normal echo shows normal function normal stress test normal blood work overall. high anxiety? !
if you have no family or personal history of sudden cardiac arrest and all your testing has been normal risk of sca would be very low.
st. abnormality lads since 2000 accelerated junctional rythmn. mitral and tricuspid regurgitation. cardiac arrests last in 2012 resting hr. of 100 bpm?
not sure what lads is? not sure what your question is.
woke up to a long fastrun of pac coughed quick to stop it felt like drums! holter 62pac majority (couplet) 7 pvc echo mvp/trivialmr cardiac arrest?
likely you have a supraventricular arrhythmia amenable to vagotonic maneuvers you need a comprehensive assessment including ecg and lab. documentation via ambulatory 30 day /ilr may be needed. please seek formal consultation with local electrophysiologists or via health tap concierge consultation
im an athlete and my heart beats so strongly (can visibly see it and feel it at rest during exercise. how do i get rid of this? it really bothers me
i would be seen just to ensure that you do not have a cardiac arrhythmia there are many apparently healthy athletes who have had a cardiac arrest from undetected arrhythmias related to congenital heart problems that were never detected.
is it possible to go into cardiac arrest from panic attacks?
that are induced or affected by catecholamine release in the body. catecholaminergic ventricular tachycardia would be one that could result in cardiac arrest. panic attacks can result in elevated catecholamine levels so the answer is yes.
pain in chest. is there a test that will confirm whether i had a cardiac arrest?
cardiac arrest means your heart stopped so if you are typing and breathing probably not. if you are wondering about a heart attack (myocardial infarction) the emergency room can run several tests in the context of other tests can confirm if chest pain is heart related.
pain in chest. is there a test that will confirm whether i had a cardiac arrest?
get the current chest pain evaluated. ekgs can show old heart attack. only at the time of a cardiac arrest or the 911 team can you know about cardiac standstill or fibrillation. if you are still alive and you must be there is no way to know if one had a prior arrest.
sometimes(once in a week) i suffer from some sort of vibrations in my chest for 3-4 secs. will it give me cardiac arrest?
probably not but a basic work up with labs echo event monitor to confirm. avoid caffeine and other stimulants.
what happens if someone goes into cardiac arrest and they have a linq reveal loop recorder implant? is it still safe to defibrillate with aed?
this is a question for the manufacturer and their engineers. google medtronic's @: <link>
had 24 hr ecg in jan all normal getting horrible feeling in chest scared of sudden cardiac arrest can i develop arrythmia?
the absence of more detailed information (age duration of symptoms triggers etc) makes it impossible to provide a meaningful answer. nonetheless if 24 hr monitor was normal one needs to consider acid reflux as a potential cause for your symptoms. see doctor again.
prescribed metoprolol er (beta blocker)? only 12. 5 mg daily. is this safe? can this cause bradycardia or cardiac arrest/heart attack or anything?
that is a low dose. it can cause a slowing of the heart rate which can be dramatic and cause symptoms in some individuals. arrest is rare. you should have your heart rate and ecg checked initially to make sure you are ok on your current dose.
prescribed metoprolol er (beta blocker)? only 12. 5 mg daily. is this safe? can this cause bradycardia or cardiac arrest/heart attack or anything?
medication and you are on the lowest dose.
the common signs that a person is about to have a heart attack before it happens?
remember a heart attack is an occlusion of a coronary artery and doesn't mean cardiac arrest. if you develop sudden crushing chest pain not relieved with rest you may be having a heart attack. seek urgent medical attention.
what otc medications can directly cause cardiac arrest within 24 hours?
over-the-counter medications depend on what you want to by. the list is infinite. vitamins analgesics cough meds weight loss. in the event you have allergic reaction all may go bad therefore you always must read the side effects contraindications and interactions with medications you are taking and check it in the internet. usually cardiac arrest is well spelled out and in bold letters
in 65 y/o female with asthma and previous cardiac arrest w/rosc during pulm. embolectomy w/ cpb. which is safest method for pericardial window?
you ask a very complicated question about a complex medical history. the 1st thing to ascertain: "why do you need a pericardial window? " normally they are for recurrent cardiac effusions; despite the dramatic surgery & event effusions aren't typical after cardiac arrest. 2nd need to know why pulm embolism developed. ttyd or use healthtap prime to find answers/specialists. not enough space here.
patient has survived from ami rescue angioplasty followed by cardiac arrest? at present basal creps positive. what does it mean?
creps is not a usual medical term. the disease process is well known and with good care and choices can be good long term. no smoking weight control cardiac rehab.
please explain what effect does "walking" regularly has on the prevention of cardiac arrest?
most cardiac arrests happen with a slight (under 50%) blockage in a heart artery. a cholesterol plaque in the artery wall breaks through the inner artery and a blood clot forms causing a complete blockage and a heart attack. you can lower your risk of this by keeping the inner lining of those arteries healthy by exercising (walking) eating healthily and controlling your blood pressure and sugar.
please advise if it's likely that i will experience cardiac arrest or heart failure while i sleep after a caffeine overdose?
what happens to you after a caffeine overdose is highly dependent on your condition going into the od. if you were otherwise normal your risk would be far lower than if you had serious cardiac disease. overdosing on anything is bad.
please tell me could a person who is suffering from pancreatitis likely to suffer from fits or cardiac arrest?
a person suffering from pancreatitis can become extremely ill and because of the various things that can happen if they become very ill then yes it is conceivable for them to have seizures (fits) or a heart attack or cardiac arrest. it would most likely be due to extreme electrolyte imbalances.
please tell me could brain rumors cause cardiac arrest?
i imagine you meant to write brain "tumors". a brain tumor wouldn't directly cause a heart attack but a person with a brain tumor could certainly have a cardiac arrest especially related to surgery or other treatment complication.
there is an article about how a girl died from going into cardiac arrest from tonsil surgery. how does that happen?
these types of cases are often related to anesthesia complications. not sure about the exact case you are referring to but thankfully this is an uncommon complication of surgery. when it does happen it is usually due to an anesthesia complication.
im a f/m 30 year old non smoker of 3 yrs. normal ecgs blood work & good cholesterol. what are my exact chances od suffering a sudden cardiac arrest?
but you have much less chances than others who have risk factors like obesity smoking heart disease uncontrolled diabetes etc. . there are several factors in the equation your only bailout is to lead a healthy life style. as for life expectancy there are websites with calculators the give you an estimate but no guarantee best wishes
my brother's heart stopped after 80% kidney stone surgery as per doctors and now treatment on that is going on. can u please explain why that happened?
i am not clear on what a "80% kidney stone" means but usually cardiac arrest during a procedure is related to anesthesia or medications given around the time of sedation. it is more likely if you have heart problems to begin with (heart disease heart failure etc. ) but sometimes bad luck happens even in the hospital so it could have been timing. best wishes hope all goes ok the 2nd time.
pacemaker problem regarding heart attack/cardiac arrest can you tell me about this?
there is far less than a 1% risk of heart attack during pacemaker implantation. once it is implanted there is almost no way it could cause a significant heart attack. it will not prevent most cardiac arrests. an icd can treat cardiac arrest from ventricular tachycardia or fibrillation
petrified of sudden cardiac arrest had 5 ecgs this week?
hi. i think you know you're obsessing. the risk of a 24 year old woman having sudden cardiac arrest in the absence of a very nasty gene or two is essentially zero. i think you should seek psychiatric help. you're wasting limited medical resources that could be really helping people. good luck!
palpitations scared of sudden cardiac arrest?
to determine the exact nature of your palpitations. you will need an ekg and/or a 24 hour holter monitor to determine the nature of these issues as well as a full medical examination and evaluation.
palpitations scared of sudden cardiac arrest?
if you are having palpitations that cause symptoms such as faintness weakness or shortness of breath then you need urgent treatment. otherwise see a cardiologist to assess the of the nature and cause of your palpitations. this will inform you of their significance and prognosis and arm you with a plan of action as well as realistic expectations. hope that helps.
recomedition for a cardiac arrest diet?
why you had the cardiac arrest. if due to coronary artery disease you should avoid simple carbs and get plenty of aerobic exercise. look at lowglycemicindex. com. also avoid caffeine and stimulants. if another cause like hocm valve disease arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia or some other cause look to treat the underlying cause first.

why someone gets cardiac arrest? and any chance of surviving that? and why sportsmen gets it they are very fit and still gets it
potential causes of cardiac arrest. too many to consider answering them in this format. many people survive cardiac arrest if they are given proper initial and subsequent care. you will have to research this issue yourself.
how you know a person has fainted away or has a cardiac arrest?
if the person has a pulse on the side of his neck and is breathing (s)he has fainted.
i have wolff parkinsons white syndrome what are my chances of sudden death?
i don't know the exact statistics but cardiac arrest (sudden death) is considered rare. see the information below re the cause of and possible treatments however for specific advice please contact a cardiologist licensed in your area. <link>
i diagnosed of interior wall ischemia is this dangerous to be anger or fear? if that emotion comes always is this a high risk of cardiac arrest?
ischemia means a narrowing of the arteries that feed the heart muscle. any type of stress either physical exertion or mental stress can strain the heart. this could disrupt a cholesterol plaque and cause a heart attack which in some cases result in cardiac arrest. it is not possible to directly assess if this is high risk but people with ischemia are at higher risk than normal population.
my grandmother of age 70 got cardiac arrest and hypoxic brain injury occured. how long it will take to recover?
the majority of the recovery occurs the first three or four days. then there can be some slow recovery of brain function. you really need to ask your neurologist or intensive care doctor what they think the prognosis is and what progress she's making
my aunt passed away last month from sudden cardiac arrest. she had gotten a flu shot 1 week prior followed by bronchitis. could they have contributed?
most likely the cardiac arrest was not in any way related to the flu shot. cardiac arrest happens randomly - there's no way to predict when or where with precision (which is why it is feared by all). while we can treat underlying medical conditions sometimes the heart probs are undetected & sometimes treatment is inadequate. in any case i am sorry for your loss but don't blame the flu shot.
my aunt passed away last month from sudden cardiac arrest. she had gotten a flu shot 1 week prior followed by bronchitis. could they have contributed?
unless your aunt suffered from an anaphylactic shock due to the flu shot (which should have happened within a few hours of the injection) it is highly impossible that the flu shot contributed in any way to the sudden cardiac arrest.
my aunt passed away last month from sudden cardiac arrest. she had gotten a flu shot 1 week prior followed by bronchitis. could they have contributed?
multiple studies have shown the flu shot is safe and it has never been connected to causing heart attacks. it is a coincidence.
normal ekg(only shows fast heartrate). normal echo/stress test and good blood work. scared of sca/ha? ! . need my mind at ease. please help? ! anybody?
why are you worrying about cardiac arrest at your age? with those normal values your probability of sca or heart attack are quite low unless there is a family history of either or both. if you are eating a mediterranean type diet and getting aerobic exercise daily with some strength training mixed in and not smoking or using street drugs you are doing great and should not be worrying.
need expert help here. what are the symptoms of sudden cardiac arrest?
i am not trying to be sarcastic at all. but "sudden cardiac arrest" is just that: a sudden stop of the heart and - if not treated right away - will uniformly lead to death. perhaps someone might feel a little funny beforehand but it is very sudden and fatal if not treated. hope this helps.
need expert help here. what are the symptoms of sudden cardiac arrest?
in a cardiac arrest the heart stops beating so the person would become unconscious and not have a pulse. if cpr or cardiopulmonary resuscitation is not immediately done the person may die. performing cpr and calling 911 may be life-saving. if interested you can learn cpr by taking classes so check for a class near you!
three years ago i passed out. the next day i went to work and felt like i was going to faint again. i was rushed to the hospital and almost went into cardiac arrest. xanax was their answer. i have been on xanax for 3 years. i want off! it's a bandaid?
it sounds like the xanax (alprazolam) actually worked to prevent fainting; the likely cause was anxiety. and you are correct. there are other effective treatments for anxiety: usually a form of cognitive behavioral therapy which would take a lot of commitment/practice from you. go ahead and pursue this but taper slowly off the xanax (alprazolam) only under careful supervision from your doctor. cold turkey is dangerous!

don't know your diagnosis. if your underlying problem is related to panic / anxiety - then it is likely decreasing symptoms without addressing underlying issues. if that is the case - would consider use of a non-benzodiazepine (like buspar/ ssri) and psychotherapy. work with your medical provider to wean off the xanax (alprazolam).
what are the symptoms of arrhythmia?
most common is the sensation of an irregular heart beat called palpitations. other symptoms may include dizziness near or complete syncope shortness of breath or in worst case cardiac arrest/sudden cardiac death.
whats the difference between cardiac arrest and heart attack and their symptoms?
the heart stops an needs to be restarted. . or cardiopulmonary resuscitation begun or death occurs. it is a form of heart attack which is a more general term for any acute heart issue (coronary etc) hope this is helpful! dr z
what does "pulmonary embolectomy with cardiac arrest and rosc" mean? they did use cpb during procedure
here is the breakdown. there was a blood clot in the lungs that was removed surgically. during the procedure the heart stopped. with cpr the heart restarted and starting pumping normally (rosc = return on spontaneous circulation). the use of cpb (cardiopulmonary bypass) is not indicated in a situation like this. hope this helped.
what is the definition or description of: hypertrophic cardiomyopathy?
hypertrophic cardiomyopathy: caused by a mutation in one of several genes for heart muscle proteins. heart muscle becomes thick. hcm can be inherited or can arise spontaneously. the main clinical concern is that in some cases it is assoc with an increased risk of sudden death. athletes with cardiac arrest during sports are often found to have hcm. this condition needs expert management.
just dx'd with svt. what are the main causes? what are long term effects on heart and body? currently seeing cardiologist for treatment.
usually it is caused by an electrical abnormality in the atria. it can be dangerous if it causes the heart to beat too long. but the. patient would definitely feel it and know something is wrong. when the heart beats in svt for a long time there is a risk of heart failure or even cardiac arrest.
normal ecgs in past petrified of sudden cardiac arrest no family history scared of dropping dead risk?
if normal ekg's no family history nor risk factors listed and no symptoms - why are you fearful? especially at age 25?
on benicar (olmesartan) 20 & lopressor 25 2 x daily for high blood press & high pulse. i'm also on ativan 1mg for anxiety. could the ativan cause cardiac arrest?
should reduce your anxiety--definitely will not cause cardiac arrest.
on benicar (olmesartan) 20 & lopressor 25 2 x daily for high blood press & high pulse. i'm also on ativan 1mg for anxiety. could the ativan cause cardiac arrest?
but it can decrease your breathing although unlikely with this low dose check with your doc!
what is cardiac arrest really?
cardiac arrest occurs when the heart stops pumping blood forward. the stoppage is usually due to to a change in the heart's electrical rhythm that prevents the muscle cells from squeezing in an organized fashion. cardiac arrest can also occur with a normal heart rhythm if the heart is too weak to pump blood or too empty to have blood to pump. in any case immediate resuscitation is needed.
what is cardiac arrest really?
a cardiac arrest literally translates to heart stop. ultimately this means that heart's main function to pump blood to vital organs has abruptly halted. the heart may fail to pump when the electrical impulse which signals the heart muscle when to pump becomes too fast too slow or even if normal in the event that the muscle is unresponsive to the current.
vasovagal attack during surgery caused cardiac arrest. doctors want to attempt another laparoscopic to remove gallbladder? chances of arrest again?
anesthesiologist will give meds to keep heart from going too slow next time
vasovagal attack during surgery caused cardiac arrest. doctors want to attempt another laparoscopic to remove gallbladder? chances of arrest again?
before you attempt that operation again i'd assume you would have some pre-operative cardiovascular testing to make sure that this episode was nothing more than happenstance.
what's the most common cause of death post cardiac arrest 7 days after achieving rosc?
hi stephen usually the cause of death is either the same as the disease that caused the cardiac arrest or as a result of secondary injury due to poor oxygenation to other organs. poor oxygenation to organs can cause severe injury to the point of multi-organ failure.
what are the complications of arrhythmia?
a heart arrhythmia can be due to a variety of causes. some are very benign (not dangerous) but some can be life threatening. complications or symptoms of an arrhythmia can include sensations of fast or abnormal heart rate or heart pounding lightheadedness almost passing out passing out shortness of breath chest pain stroke cardiac arrest and death.
can you tell me how propofol may cause heart dysfunction leading to cardiac arrest?
propofol is an anesthesia. it goes to the brain and depresses the breathing center. this causes hypoxia to all tissues including the heart. the hypoxia also causes acidosis from anaerobic respiration and vasodilatation and drop in bp. this all lead to hypoxia of tissues including heart muscles and eventual death of tissues.
can paitents of heart sarcoidosis go into cardiac arrest in a hospital?
sarcoidosis of heart can cause arrhythmias which may result in death.
can paitents of heart sarcoidosis go into cardiac arrest in a hospital?
due to sarcoidosis affecting electrical conduction system.
can paitents of heart sarcoidosis go into cardiac arrest?
sarcoidosis of the heart can block the electrical system and cause both arrhythmias and heart block which can lead to cardiac arrest. this is a very serious condition and sometimes requires a pacemaker or even an implantable defibrillator. cardiology consultation and management is highly desirable.
can paitents of heart sarcoidosis go into cardiac arrest?
yes cardiac sarcoidosis increases the risk of ventricular tachycardia which may progress into cardiac arrest. often patient with this condition get implantable defibrillators (icds) to prevent cardiac arrest.
can quitting alcohol cold turkey cause a cardiac arrest?
you may have withdrawal which can be controlled with meds.
can quitting alcohol cold turkey cause a cardiac arrest?
while many drugs can be stopped cold turkey almost all will cause some level of withdrawal. withdrawal symptoms from narcotic drugs such as heroin or cocaine can produce diarrhea chills nausea or vomiting but will usually not kill you. alcohol withdrawal is much more dangerous and can cause seizures and heart arrythmias which can lead to cardiac arrest. never quit without medical supervision!
can quitting alcohol cold turkey cause a cardiac arrest?
alcohol withdrawal (delirium tremens) can be very serious and usually requires hospitalization. if the heart has been damaged from alcohol use (alcoholic cardiomyopathy) it is possible that the stress of withdrawal could lead to arrhythmias and cardiac arrest but this is rare.
should you remove nipple piercings before you use an aed?
the most important predictor of success when using an aed is how quickly (after cardiac arrest) the shock is delivered. when placed appropiately the pads of an aed should not come in contact with a nipple ring but regardless the time spent removing the rings is better spent applying the pads and delivering what may be a life saving shock.
what can cause myocardial fibrosis? is sudden death common with myocardial fibrosis?
sudden cardiac death is related to ejection fraction. the lower it is the greater the risk. the cause of myocardial fibrosis is in most cases not known. if you've had a cardiac arrest due to myocardial fibrosis you should have an icd placed.

there are a legion of things that can cause heart problems severe heart disease and imbalance in metabolic state of the body can cause cardiac arrest. ischemic heart disease is the commonest cause of cardiac arrest.
what are symptoms or signs of cardiac arrest?
a cardiac arrest patient will rapidly lose consciousness no pulse no audible heart tones no response to stimuli the patient will also rapidly lose spontaneous respiration.
what are symptoms or signs of cardiac arrest?
if standing or sitting fall down. if lying down pulseless and a few gasps. if you see call 911' do basic life assessment and chest compressions.
why would someone become incontinent shortly before going into cardiac arrest?
incontinence pre arrest suggests the voluntary and involuntary nervous systems are malfunctioning from drop in perfusion.
why would someone become incontinent shortly before going into cardiac arrest?
probably going into heart block shock brain ischemia syncope fall incontinence arrest all in a continuum.
what is the clinical difference between hypovolemic shock and amniotic fluid embolism during c section?
hypovolemic shock is blood and fluid loss usually from bleeding causing severe low bp and cardiac arrest from loss of perfusion. amniotic fluid embolism leads to low bp from allergic vasodilation and then bleeding from dic (disseminated intravascular coagulation) which results in hypovolemic shock and cardiac arrest. the mechanisms are similar but different.
what can happen if your heart starts to beat too quickly? i need to know if you can go into cardiac arrest or something like that. are there any procedures/surgeries that could fix it?
most tachyarrythmias- fast heart can be treated medically or specifically diagnosed and treated with electrical ablation or surgical maze operations. venticular tachycardia and fibrillation can occur but decreased by proper diagnosis and therapy.
when is acls necessary?
acls is used to stabilize and reverse an underlying cardiac arrest. in other words when a person loses consciousness due to a pathological heart rhythm problem basic cpr will maintain the heart pumping blood to the brain and other vital organs but acls is needed to correct the abnormal heart rhythm and whatever is causing it.
what's a shock to the heart called? when someone delivers a shock to the heart to treat abnormal rhythms what's that called?
a shock used for cardiac arrest (ventricular fibrillation) is called defibrillation. all other shocks are called synchronized (direct current) cardioversions.
what's a shock to the heart called? when someone delivers a shock to the heart to treat abnormal rhythms what's that called?
there are two types of shocks where electrical energy is delivered to the heart to restore a normal heart rhythm. when somebody experiences cardiac arrest the shock is called a defibrillation. this can be delivered by an external defibrillator applied by medical personnel or by a bystander. many common areas such as airports and malls now have automatic external defibrillators (aeds) that can be applied by a layperson and have been shown in research studies to increase the chances of survival after cardiac arrest. some people at risk for cardiac arrest have defibrillators implanted in their body capable of recognizing abnormal rhythms and automatically delivering a shock. the other type of shock is called a synchronized cardioversion. this is performed when the heart is in an abnormal rhythm but is still functioning fairly well and so is typically not performed in an emergency situation. atrial fibrillation is the most common rhythm that requires cardioversion. this is a very safe and common procedure.
what causes an enlarged heart? what causes an enlarged heart and why are people with enlarged heart more at risk with their health?
there are many causes of an enlarged heart and the heart can enlarge in different ways. in some conditions the heart chambers dilate and the heart muscle weakens. this dilation most often occurs as a consequence of prior heart attacks which is called ischemic cardiomyopathy. it can also be caused by toxins such as excessive alcohol genetic abnormalities metabolic derangements such as thyroid disease or sometimes occurs with no apparent cause (idiopathic cardiomyopathy). in some other conditions the heart muscle thickens excessively as opposed to dilating and this also leads to an enlarged heart. the most common cause of a thick heart is untreated hypertension but it can also be caused by a genetic condition called hypertrophic cardiomyopathy or can also occur when substances infiltrate and replace heart muscle. people with an enlarged heart are at increased risk for a few different reasons. if the heart muscle weakens they can develop congestive heart failure which causes many symptoms and increases the risk of death. people with an enlarged heart are also at increased risk for arrhythmias which in certain circumstances can cause cardiac arrest.
what is the difference between cpr and aed? which is more effective?
cpr is cardiopulmonary resuscitation including chest compressions and an aed is a device used to shock the abnormal rhythm back to normal. both are necessary to revive a patient in cardiac arrest.
what is the difference between cpr and aed? which is more effective?
if someone has a cardiac arrest (heart stoppage) they require immediate cpr to provide artificial and minimal circulation. an aed is used during cpr to restore cardiac rhythm and thus spontaneous circulation. the sooner an aed is employed during cpr the better the chance that the victim will survive.
where can i get an aed for my home?
aed's are very effective and are a worthwhile investment in certain situations. aed's have been shown to be effective when placed in high density areas (airports sport stadiums etc). they have not been shown to be effective for more personalized use. my sense is that if a household member has a high risk of cardiac arrest an aed is a reasonable investment. if everyone is healthy reconsider.
why is adrenaline not the medication for heart failure?
adrenaline is only used during cardiac arrest to "restart" the heart. it has a very short half-life and is metabolized very fast. one of the long-term complications of heart failure is caused by too much adrenaline production to try to stimulate the heart. beta-blocker medications block the long-term effects of adrenaline and reduce mortality from heart failure.
what are the consequences of coronary heart disease?
coronary heart disease can result in chest tightness or pain on exertion (called "angina") exertional shortness of breath ("dyspnea") heart attack (coronary occlusion) heart failure cardiac rhythm irregularities ("arrhythmias") cardiac arrest ("sudden death") and a shortened life expectancy.
what additional measures to cardioversion may be necessary to prevent death and complications from cardiovascular causes?
i'm not sure if i understood your question correctly. if you're talking about someone who has cardiac arrest beside cardioversion and protection of airways restoration of hemodynamic is necessary to improve the patient's survival. most important factor here is the downtime from cardiac arrest. cooling process is another way to improve the outcome.
what is the most common underlying cause of sudden cardiac death in children?
cardiac arrest is rather rare in children. the most common causes are mostly due to respiratory infections shock and bowel infections causing septic shock.
what are symptoms of a pulmonary embolism?
larger emboli cause shortness of breath (dyspenea) pleuritic chest pain or both. dyspnea may be intermittent or occur only with exercise. less common symptoms include cough and coughing up blood. the first symptom in an elderly patient may be altered mental status. massive pe may show low bp rapid heart rate fainting or cardiac arrest. it's a medical emergency and should be taken seriously.
what kind of complications might happen from a coronary angioplasty?
there are lots of complication that can happen during angioplasty 1. excessive bleeding from punctured site 2. infection 3. pseudo aneurism 4. acute heart attack 5. acute stroke 6. coronary dissection 7. cardiac tamponade and even cardiac arrest leadind to death. all these complication are very very rare.

bleeding infection irregular heart beat perforation of the heart heart attack dissection of the aorta cardiac arrest stroke renal failure gangrene pseudo aneurysm shock death.
will a blood clot in lung stop me from going on my vacation?
the size of the clot dictates how dangerous it is. very very tiny emboli may not have much clinical consequence unless it happens frequently. a large embolus that blocks large amounts of flow to the lung can cause symptoms including shortness of breath and even cardiac arrest. unexpected shortness of breath should always be considered an emergency and evaluated by a doctor right away!
what are the symptoms of acute cardiovascular disease?
depending on which cv disease you mean: heart attack? heart failure? cardiac arrest? etc. very generally heart disease causes one or more of the following: chest pain shortness of breath fluid retention palpitations dizziness or loss of consciousness. (sorry but that's a general answer to a general question).
what problem does more blood dumping into the heart's atria lead to?
volume overload to the atria will lead to pressure overload and chamber enlargement -- and this will lead to cardiac arrhythmia and others more serious like stroke heart failure and even cardiac arrest if left untreated.
what risks are associated with congestive heart failure and pregnancy?
of chf and its complications such as kidney failure fetus blood supply issues sudden cardiac arrest heart attack. . <link>
why is it that adrenaline is contraindicated in heart failure?
adrenaline stimulates the heart and vascular vigorously and can trigger arrhtymias and muscle fatigue worsening the heart failure. we do use adrenaline sometimes during cardiac arrest in the hope it will get things going.
what are the procedures medical staff follow when a patient goes into cardiac arrest?
depends on the setting? in the hall call for help- code blue. assess and start basic life support defibrillator and assess and shock if arrythmia appropriate start iv and proceed to acls protocol. in an icu monitoring and lines in place move to acls and beyond.
what are the procedures medical staff follow when a patient goes into cardiac arrest?
perform immediate cardiopulmonary resuscitation.
when your heart just randomly stops what is that called?
if you are talking about complete stop then this is a sudden cardiac arrest (or sudden death) also called asystole. however if it stops only briefly then this can be normal and called a sinus pause. a slow rate is bradycardia. you can not have a pulse but the heart still beat like in v tach or v fib. if you are having problems then you need to see a doctor asap.
what are the causes of extreme stomach pain cardiac arrest and ultimately death?
right coronary or inferior heart wall damage can act like that! .
what are some early indicators and symptoms of sudden cardiac arrest?
if standing or sitting fall down. if lying down pulseless and a few gasps. if you see call 911' do basic life assessment and chest compressions.
what are some early indicators and symptoms of sudden cardiac arrest?
"sudden cardiac arrest" means a sudden stopping of the heart. there usually is no warning. that's why it is so deadly.
what is cardiac arrest?
by definition cardiac arrest is the cessation of normal circulation of the blood due to failure of the heart to contract. .
what is cardiac arrest?
sudden arrest of heart function usually either heart rhythm is abnormal or as a result of mi a large part of heart muscle dies.
what is cardiac arrest?
can be total non function= dead or more commonly ventricular fibrillation or tachycardia with no effective pumping and potential salvage with cpr and defibrillation. or occasionally severe heart electrical block with slow slow pulse treated by pacing.
what exactly is the youngest age you can be to have a cardiac arrest from an overdose?
from an overdose there is no youngest age.
what exactly is the youngest age you can be to have a cardiac arrest from an overdose?
if any age uses-they are at risk! children may inadvertently come upon household medications or drugs and die of toxicity - overdoses at any time prevention is key.
what is the likelihood of a young adult dying from sudden cardiac arrest?
possible but low. the more risk factors one has the higher the risk. these include family history high blood pressure high cholesterol smoking and diabetes.
what is the likelihood of a young adult dying from sudden cardiac arrest?
unless congenital or acquired heart disease and bad habits! smoking cocaine obesity and diabetes hypercholesterolemic hypertension etc.
what does someone feel when having a cardiac arrest?
when bp drops below 60mm/hg loss of consciousness usually occurs therefore you may still remain conscious for a few seconds after the heart stops.
what does someone feel when having a cardiac arrest?
then nothing. no pulsatille flow. pallor occasionally a seizure. no brain circulation we are guessing since we really do not know except sometimes seeing someone in hospital on monitor and observing it happen and inquiring!
would it be possible that a heart attack really cause permanent brain damage. if so how?
a heart attack is heart damage. but if the heart attack causes low blood pressure shock hypoxia cardiac arrest etc. then brain damage can occur. atrial fibrillation clotting and embolism to the brain can cause strokes as well.
what to do or how to handle if i have a heart attack alone? and also what time do i have to get some help (minutes or seconds)?
i don't really know whether you mean having a heart attack or facing someone with heart attack. do you mean heart attack or cardiac arrest. anyway if you feel you are having heart attack the first thing to do is to take an aspirin and call emergency.
what can we do to find out if my husband's heart is really that bad?
ok trhoppel you pique my curiosity! how bad is your husband's heart? why do you think it's bad? has he been tested? has he had a heart attack? has he had an echocardiogram? does have congestive heart failure? has he had a cardiac arrest? the answer to your question is to see your doctor - which i assume you've done?
why is amiodorone prefered to lignocaine in cardiac arrest?
equally efficacious for ventricular & supra ventricular arrhythmias while lidocaine is second tier choice for vt.
why is amiodorone prefered to lignocaine in cardiac arrest?
lidocaine is rarely effective whereas amiodarone is often effective at suppressing recurrent sustained ventricular tachycardia which is it's primary indication.
when someone goes in 2 complete cardiac arrest. no pulse heaetbeat. how many min would it take without oxyegen to b brain dead?
survival from cardiac arrest is determined by many things and time is certainly an important one. however how well the body is oxygenated and perfused during the arrest (say by cpr) as well as body temperature all play a role. in your question you imply there is no oxygen - so the answer is mere minutes.
what causes sqelling on brainn with heart attack?
if your question is "what causes brain swelling after cardiac arrest? " the answer is this. the brain swelling or edema is caused by high pressure on the veins and diffuse hypoxia of the brain during the resuscitation process.
what is the cardiovascular response to shock?
not related to the emotional state of shock circulatory shock is a life-threatening medical emergency and one of the most common causes of death for critically ill people. shock can have a variety of effects. for example shock may lead to hypoxemia or cardiac arrest. tachycardia with weak pulse cool clammy skin and hypothermia due to vasoconstricition hope that helps.
why do people die suddenly from myocarditis without knowing something wrong?
sudden death can occur if the heart is so damaged that you develop an arrhythmia it's possible the arrhythmia could cause your heart to suddenly stop beating (sudden cardiac arrest). if not treated immediately it causes sudden cardiac death.
can hyperkalemia cause bradycardia?
an extremely elevated level of potassium in the blood (hyperkalemia) can cause a slow heart rate (bradycardia) and even cardiac arrest.
could a pacemaker keep an individuals heart beating after a cardiac arrest. if the answer to the above question is yes then how long would it continue to assist the heart in beating and would it help to prevent brain damage until medical help arrives.
in most circumstances the term cardiac arrest refers to a rhythm problem called ventricular fibrillation. eventually there is no electrical activity at all and even a pacemaker cannot stimulate the heart.
could a pacemaker keep an individuals heart beating after a cardiac arrest. if the answer to the above question is yes then how long would it continue to assist the heart in beating and would it help to prevent brain damage until medical help arrives.
yes. a pacemaker is placed in the heart to prevent the heart from beating too slow. as an example a pacemaker may be set to ensure the heart beats 70 times a minute. if your intrinsic heart beats slower than 70 or if your heart stops beating (as in a cardiac arrest) then the pacemaker will send an electrical impulse to the heart to keep beating at 70 beats per minute. to avoid brain damage the person must also be breathing normally. if the person is not breathing normally (10-20 breaths per minute) call 911 and initate cpr.
can cpr restart a stopped heart?
the heart is an interesting organ because very tiny amounts of electrical activity are generated by the exchange of various chemicals such as sodium potassium and chloride as these chemicals move across the cell walls. this is where the spikes on an ekg come from. when severely disrupted as in cardiac arrest the appropriate application of cpr can cause the heart to restart.
can the after effect of a cardiac arrest affect your thinking power?
during a cardiac arrest there is not blood flow and thus oxygen to the brain. even is someone survies they may have brain damage. at times it can be minor but may have an affect on someones memory congnition personality.
can the after effect of a cardiac arrest affect your thinking power?
the brain can be stunned from the lack of adequate blood supply during the arrest. impaired thinking is frequent following an arrest. protective strategies include cooling the body to protect the brain after an arrest.
can the after effect of a cardiac arrest affect your thinking power?
it depends on the time that the brain did not get blood flow. it is the reason hypothermia for cardiac arrest that is prolonged in an effort to slow down brain metabolism and preserve function.
can leukemia cause a cardiac arrest?
not in and of itself. however some of the drugs used in the treatment od leukemia can be cardiotoxic. in addition patients with leukemia are often very i'll and may have underlying conditions that become more problematic during treatment.
can leukemia cause a cardiac arrest?
complications of leukemia can cause cardiac arrest such as septic shock. if the leukemia is refractory to treatment cardiac arrest may be the ultimate cause of death.
can leukemia cause a cardiac arrest?
lekemia pts may take cardiotoxic chemotherapy and need echocardiography to evaluate for cardiomyopathy. clooging a coronary artey with leukemia cells would be an extremely rare occurrence.
can a pacemaker revive someone from a fatal arrhythmia?
a pacemaker will revive you from a dangerously slow heart rhythm. most fatal arrhythmias however are due to ventricular arrhythmias that lead to cardiac arrest. these are very fast rhythms in which a pacemaker won't do anything for but an implantable defibrillator would help.
can the vagal nerve stimulation device cause cardiac arrest?
in a damaged heart vagal stimulation will decrease the heart rate and atrial contractility thus decreasing ventricular filling. this effect can produce cardiac arrest in in circumstances of coronary artery disease or low ef cardiomyopathy.
