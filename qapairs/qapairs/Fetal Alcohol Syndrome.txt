majority causes of fetal cardiomegaly is cardiac and anemic in origin. it carried high-perinatal mortality depending on the causes. structural heart defect or congenital heart disease could have genetic or familial causes but it would not be something that the mother is directly responsible other than genetics which she cannot control. enlarged heart has been linked to fetal alcohol syndrome.
