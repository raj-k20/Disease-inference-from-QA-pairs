i get extreme anxiety that is highly interfering whenever i start a new job almost like an adjustment disorder. would propranolol be reasonable?
propranolol is a useful adjunct to the treatment of panic attacks but there are many useful medications and desensitization psychotherapy would be helpful with the medication so i urge you (because you describe this as disabling and uncomfortable) to seek counseling.
