what if it isn't 'athletic heart syndrome'?
my heart is big and i have an extra sound on the left-bottom side of my sternum because i'm in training for an endurance swim. this is a good thing. if you're an athlete and can keep up and your physician has said something nice about your heart and you're having no chest pain or passing out ; are normotensive then stop worrying and embrace your achievement.
